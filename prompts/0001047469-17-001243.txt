      Item 1.   Business 
  Organizational Structure and History 
 Heritage Oaks Bancorp (the "Company") is a California corporation organized in 1994 and is registered as a bank holding company for Heritage Oaks Bank (the "Bank"). The Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of the Bank and its subsidiaries in 1994. The Bank is licensed by the California Department of Business Oversight, Division of Financial Institutions ("DBO") and commenced operation in January 1983. As a California state bank, the Bank is subject to primary supervision, examination and regulation by the DBO and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), and is also subject to certain other federal laws and regulations. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any reference to the term "Management" refers to the executive management team of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
 The Company formed Heritage Oaks Capital Trust II in October 2006. This trust is a statutory business trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware and is a wholly-owned, non-financial, non-consolidated subsidiary of the Company. The Company also acquired Mission Community Capital Trust I and Santa Lucia Bancorp (CA) Capital Trust as part of the acquisition of Mission Community Bancorp in 2014. These trusts are statutory business trusts, and are wholly-owned, non-financial, non-consolidated subsidiaries of the Company. Additionally, the Company has incorporated a subsidiary, CCMS Systems, Inc., which is currently inactive and has not been capitalized. 
 The Company is authorized to engage in a variety of banking activities with the prior approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"), the Company's principal regulator. However, banking activities primarily occur at the Bank. As a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, the Company's principal source of funds are dividends received from the Bank, as well as equity or debt it issues. Legal limitations are imposed on the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank to the Company. See Item 1. Business  Supervision and Regulation and Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  Dividends. 
   Recent Developments 
   Merger Agreement 
 On December 12, 2016, the Company and Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PPBI"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which the Company will be merged with and into PPBI, with PPBI surviving (the "Corporate Merger"), immediately followed by the merger of Heritage Oaks Bank with and into Pacific Premier Bank, the wholly-owned bank subsidiary of PPBI ("Pacific Premier"), with Pacific Premier surviving (the "Bank Merger"). The Corporate Merger and Bank Merger are collectively referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the "Announced Transaction." The consideration paid to shareholders of the Company will consist of whole shares of PPBI common stock, and cash in lieu of fractional shares of PPBI common stock. Upon consummation of the Corporate Merger, each share of the Company's common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive 0.3471 shares of PPBI common stock.

   The consummation of the Announced Transaction is subject to a number of conditions, which include: (i) the approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company's shareholders and the approval of the issuance of shares of PPBI common stock by PPBI's shareholders; (ii) as of the month-end prior to the closing of the Announced Transaction, Heritage Oaks Bank must have an aggregate outstanding balance of non-maturity deposits equal to at least $1.25 billion; (iii) as of the closing of the Announced Transaction, the Company shall have tangible common equity of not less than $183.0 million, subject to certain assumptions and adjustments that are set forth in the Merger Agreement; (iv) the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals for the Announced Transaction, without the imposition of conditions or requirements, other than conditions or requirements related to remedial actions, that the PPBI board of directors reasonably determines in good faith would not, individually or in the aggregate, materially reduce the economic benefits of the Announced Transaction; (v) the absence of any regulation, judgment, decree, injunction or other order of a governmental authority which prohibits the consummation of the Announced Transaction or which makes illegal the consummation of the Announced Transaction; (vi) the effective registration of the shares of PPBI common stock to be issued to the Company's shareholders with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the approval of such shares for listing on the Nasdaq Global Market; (vii) all representations and warranties made by PPBI and the Company in the Merger Agreement must remain true and correct, except for certain inaccuracies that would not have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect; and (viii) PPBI and the Company must have performed their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement in all material respects. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which has been previously filed with the SEC on Form 8-K dated December 13, 2016. 
 The representations, warranties and covenants of each party set forth in the Merger Agreement have been made only for purposes of, and were and are solely for the benefit of the parties to, the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. 
   Termination of Mortgage Banking Business 
 In January 2017, the Company's Management and Board of Directors decided to discontinue activities related to the consumer mortgage banking business, effective February 1, 2017. This decision is primarily attributable to current market conditions, such as rising interest rates, and increasing housing prices. The discontinuation of the consumer mortgage banking business did not involve the sale of existing mortgage assets, rather it entailed the termination of certain business activities such as originating and selling consumer mortgage loans. The Company, however, continues to offer home equity lines of credit and home equity loans. The Company ceased accepting new applications on February 1, 2017, and will terminate all consumer mortgage origination related operations on or about April 30, 2017, other than servicing existing consumer mortgage loans within the Company's loan portfolio. In order to ensure that Heritage Oaks Bank customers continue to have access to consumer mortgage products, the Company entered into a referral arrangement with another bank that has a strategic focus on the consumer mortgage business, and which is not a competitor in terms of deposit gathering and their branch geographic footprint. Effective February 1, 2017, many of the Company's consumer mortgage banking team members joined this other bank. The Company will continue to serve the needs of mortgage customers with loans that were in process of origination prior to February 1, 2017, and will continue to service all loans remaining in the Company's portfolio indefinitely. The Company will honor all contractual commitments to both customers and investors that were in process prior to February 1, 2017. Management expects that the majority of existing loan applications that were in process prior to February 1, 2017 will close within 90 days.

     Banking Activities 
 Headquartered in Paso Robles, California, the Bank is a community-oriented financial services firm that provides banking products and services to small and medium sized businesses and consumers. Products and services are offered primarily through 12 retail branches located on the Central Coast of California, in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties and through other direct channels, including a loan production office in Ventura County. 
 Business Strategy 
 The Company's business objective is to be the leading community bank on the Central Coast of California to targeted businesses and consumers. We seek to achieve this objective by employing our business strategies as follows: 
 Deliver Superior Customer Service 
 We believe that it is imperative for us to deliver superior customer service to be successful. The pursuit of superior customer service is not a slogan for us but rather a fundamental aspect of our culture. A key element to superior customer service is providing authority to local decision makers so that customers are given a quick response to their financial needs, while at the same time providing the proper tools to the local decision makers to ensure that the products and services offered are profitable for us and safe and sound. 
 Enhance Product Delivery to Our Customers 
 We believe that our customers should have a positive experience at every point of contact with us. The primary point of contact with our customers continues to be our retail offices. We continue to implement user-friendly technologies for our customers who want to interact with us through electronic channels such as the internet, phone, or other mobile devices. We currently offer online banking, bill pay, and cash management; remote deposit capture; Automated Clearing House ("ACH") and positive payments; automatic payroll deposits; eDelivery; prepaid gift and payroll cards; some advanced function ATMs; and mobile banking. We expect to continue to expand our electronic delivery channels as customer preferences change and newer devices and technologies are developed. We believe the combination of high touch service in retail locations and user-friendly electronic banking services enhances our customer experience. It also provides us additional delivery channels to attract more customers. 
 Maintain Strong Brand Awareness 
 We expend a considerable amount of resources maintaining and enhancing our retail brand. We believe that our brand should reflect the superior customer service we offer as a community bank and our commitment to the communities where we operate. Maintaining strong brand awareness requires a consistent brand design; effective use of marketing and merchandising; participation and sponsorship in community based events; and usage of multiple media sources. We hold service marks issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the "Oakley" design; and the tag line "Heritage Oaks Bank  We're central to the Coast." We continually evaluate the effectiveness of our brand and from time to time will take steps to improve our overall brand awareness in the markets we serve.

     Increase Market Share in Existing Markets and Expand into New Markets 
 During the economic downturn, there were a number of community banks, which operated in the Central Coast of California, that were acquired by larger commercial banks. We believe these acquisitions provide us with the opportunity to increase market share in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties and potentially expand into new markets contiguous to these counties, such as our 2012 expansion in Ventura County with the opening of a loan production office. In the past we have regularly evaluated opportunities to either open de novo retail offices; purchase branches from other financial institutions; or to acquire financial institutions in proximity to our geographic footprint, as evidenced by our December 2012 purchase of the Morro Bay branch of Coast National Bank and our merger with Mission Community Bancorp ("MISN") and Mission Community Bank, which closed in February 2014. 
 The Company believes the combination with MISN created a more valuable retail and business community banking franchise, with a low cost core deposit base, strong capital ratios, attractive net interest margins, lower operating costs, and better overall returns for the shareholders of the combined institution. It also created a banking platform that is well positioned for future growth. 
   Community Service 
 We strongly believe in enhancing the economic vitality and welfare of the communities where we work and live. In 2016, Bank employees provided approximately 2,500 hours in direct volunteer support of local community activities, projects, and events. The Bank also provided in-kind support throughout the year including providing meeting rooms at retail branch and administrative locations, and giving surplus furniture and used computers to local partners. Bank employees also serve on boards of local non-profit and charitable organizations. Finally, we donated over $0.4 million during 2016 to local organizations and charities to support community related activities. 
 Products and Services 
 We offer a full array of financial products and services to targeted businesses and consumers. We regularly monitor our customers' financial needs to determine whether we should design or offer new products and services. We also regularly monitor the pricing and profitability of these financial products and services to ensure that we are able to achieve a reasonable rate of return for the risks we assume in offering such products and services. The Bank offers to its commercial clients commercial loans secured by real estate, other commercial loans and lines of credit, agricultural loans, construction financing, other real estate loans and small business administration loans. The Bank also offers interest rate swap products to commercial clients who meet certain suitability requirements. For consumers, the Bank offers home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans. The Bank employs relationship managers focused on the development and origination of new loan and banking relationships across the markets it serves. Deposits are obtained primarily through retail deposit gathering efforts as well as through commercial, state and municipal account relationships. Deposit products offered include personal and business checking and savings accounts, time deposit accounts, individual retirement accounts ("IRAs"), health savings accounts ("HSAs"), money market accounts. The Bank also offers online banking, mobile banking, wire transfers, safe deposit boxes, cashier's checks, traveler's checks, bank-by-mail, remote deposit capture, night depository services and other customary banking services. 
 Competition, Market and Economic Conditions 
 The banking and financial services industry in California generally, and in the Company's service area specifically, is highly competitive. Although the Company holds a significant presence within its primary market areas, money center banks and large regional banks, by virtue of their larger capital bases, have significantly larger lending limits than we do and generally have more expansive branch networks. 
 7

   Competition also includes other community-focused commercial banks. In addition, credit unions also present a significant competitive challenge for us. Credit unions currently have an exemption from income taxes and as a result can offer higher deposit rates and lower loan rates than we can on a comparable basis. 
 As the industry becomes increasingly dependent upon and oriented toward technology-driven delivery systems, permitting transactions to be conducted by telephone, computer, the internet and smartphone and tablet devices, non-bank institutions are able to attract funds and provide lending and other financial services without offices located in our primary service area. The increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers. 
 In order to compete with other financial institutions in our service area, we principally rely upon direct personal contact with our customers and potential customers by executive officers, directors and employees, local advertising programs, and specialized services. We emphasize to our customers the advantages of dealing with a community oriented bank. We also seek to provide special services and programs for businesses and individuals in our primary service area who are employed in the agricultural, professional, municipal and business fields, such as loans for equipment, tools of trade or expansion of practices or businesses. 
 The economy in the Company's primary market area (San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties) is based primarily on agriculture, hospitality, light industry, oil and retail trade. Additionally, the local economy in San Luis Obispo County and to a lesser degree Santa Barbara County is dependent on the level of employment generated by state and local government agencies. Services supporting these industries have also developed in the areas of medical, financial and educational services. The populations of San Luis Obispo County, the City of Santa Maria (in Northern Santa Barbara County), and the City of Santa Barbara totaled approximately 281,000, 106,000, and 92,000 respectively, according to the most recent data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. 
 The moderate climate allows a year round growing season in the local economy's agricultural sector. Vineyards in production have grown significantly over the past several years throughout the Company's service area. Additionally, fruit, nut, and vegetable farming, as well as cattle ranching, represent major parts of the agriculture industry in the Company's market area. Furthermore, access to numerous recreational activities and destinations including beaches, mountains, lakes, and wineries provide a relatively stable tourism industry from many areas including the Los Angeles/Orange County basin, the San Francisco Bay area and the San Joaquin Valley. 
 Beginning in 2012 and continuing through 2016, the business climate has shown steady signs of improvement including improved real estate prices and a decline in the unemployment rates. The most recent labor market information published by the California Employment Development Department shows the unemployment rate within California to be approximately 5.0%, compared to over 12% at the peak of the economic crisis in 2010. 
 The Company's profitability, like most financial institutions, is primarily dependent on interest rate differentials. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company's control and cannot be predicted, such as inflation, recession and unemployment, and the impact that future changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions might have on the Company. A more detailed discussion of the Company's interest rate risks and the mitigation of those risks is included in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   The Company's business is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve Board implements national monetary policies (with objectives such as maintaining price stability, stimulating growth and reducing unemployment) through its open market operations in U.S. Government securities, by adjusting the required level of reserves for depository institutions subject to its reserve requirements, and by varying the target Federal funds and discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans and deposits, and also affect interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. The nature of any future changes in monetary and fiscal policies on the Company cannot be predicted and the impact could be material and adverse. 
 Management remains cautiously optimistic that there will be continued slow but steady improvement in economic conditions in 2017 in our primary markets. However, there have been continued concerns regarding both the global economy and the national economy due primarily to excessive government debt, public perceptions of unsound fiscal policies, and a significant decline in the price of oil, and equity markets. There are also growing concerns that the prolonged drought, which has affected most of California, could have adverse impacts on the Central Coast of California's critical agriculture market, and therefore our loan portfolio, in the future should drought conditions continue to persist. If either of these uncertainties materialize they could eventually affect our local economy, and ultimately negatively impact the financial condition of borrowers to whom the Company has extended credit. In turn, the Company may suffer higher credit losses as a result. 
   Employees 
 At December 31, 2016, the Company employed 302 full-time equivalent employees. The Company's employees are not represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes that its employee relations are positive. 
 Supervision and Regulation 
   General 
 The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Company is registered with and subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board as a bank holding company. The Company is also subject to certain provisions of the California Financial Code applicable to bank holding companies. As a California state-chartered bank whose accounts are insured by the FDIC, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the California Department of Business Oversight (the "DBO") and the FDIC. Such supervision and regulation covers substantially all of the Bank's business activities, including, among others, capital standards, general investment authority, deposit taking and borrowing authority, mergers, establishment of branch offices and permitted subsidiary investments and activities. In addition, while the Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is subject to certain regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. The federal and state regulatory systems are intended primarily for the protection of bank depositors, the FDIC deposit insurance fund (the "DIF") and the banking system as a whole and not for the benefit of shareholders.

     Legislation and Regulatory Developments 
 Bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are subject to significant regulation and restrictions by federal and state laws and regulatory agencies. The following paragraph summarizes certain of the laws and regulations that apply to the Company and the Bank. These descriptions of statutes and regulations and their possible effects do not purport to be complete descriptions of all of the provisions of those statutes and regulations and their possible effects on the Company or the Bank, nor do they purport to identify every statute and regulation that may apply to the Company and the Bank. 
 From time to time, federal and state legislation is enacted that may have the effect of materially increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities, or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers. For example, the implementation and impact of legislation and regulations enacted since 2008 in response to the U.S. economic downturn and financial industry instability continued in 2016 as federal banking agencies implemented additional requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act"). State and federal bank regulatory agencies continue to adopt other regulations and guidelines intended to assure the financial strength and safety and soundness of banks and the stability of the U.S. banking system. 
   Regulatory Enforcement Authority 
 If the FDIC determines that a bank's financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of its operations are unsatisfactory, or that it or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, various remedies are available to the FDIC. Such remedies include the power to: enjoin "unsafe or unsound" practices; require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice; issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced; direct an increase in capital; restrict growth; assess civil monetary penalties; remove officers and directors; institute a receivership; and, ultimately terminate the bank's deposit insurance, which would result in a revocation of its charter. The DBO separately holds many of the same remedial powers. 
 In the exercise of their supervisory and examination authority, the federal and state bank regulatory agencies have recently emphasized corporate governance, capital planning and stress testing, liquidity management, enterprise risk management and other board responsibilities, anti-money laundering compliance, information technology adequacy, cyber security preparedness, vendor management and fair lending and other consumer compliance obligations. 
 Until November 29, 2016, the Bank was subject to a Consent Order (the "BSA Consent Order") dated November 5, 2014 issued by the FDIC and the DBO relating to identified deficiencies in the Bank's centralized Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering compliance program. The FDIC and the DBO terminated the BSA Consent Order on November 29, 2016.

  Capital Adequacy Requirements 
 Bank holding companies and banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by their state and federal banking agencies. Federal banking agencies adopted new capital rules (the "New Capital Rules") that generally became effective in 2015, but many elements are being phased in over multiple years. The New Capital Rules replace previous risk-based and leverage capital requirements for banking organizations and were adopted to meet requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and to implement the international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Basel III agreements. The risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations (see "Item 1. Business  Prompt Corrective Action Provisions"), require capital ratios that vary based on the perceived degree of risk associated with a banking organization's operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, such as loans, and those recorded as off-balance sheet items, such as commitments, letters of credit and recourse arrangements. The risk-based capital ratio is determined by classifying assets and certain off-balance sheet financial instruments into weighted categories, with higher levels of capital being required for those categories perceived as representing greater risks and dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance sheet items. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting, and other factors. 
 Many of the requirements in the New Capital Rules and other regulations and rules apply only to larger or internationally active institutions and not to institutions with less than $10 billion of assets, which currently includes the Company and the Bank. These requirements include required annual stress tests for institutions with $10 billion or more of assets with reporting requirements and Enhanced Prudential Standards, Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review requirements; capital plan and Resolution Plan or living will submissions, an additional countercyclical capital buffer, a supplementary leverage ratio and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio rule requiring sufficient high-quality liquid assets which may apply to institutions with $50 billion or more or $250 billion or more assets or which may be identified as Global Systemically Important Banking Institutions. 
 The New Capital Rules narrow the definition of regulatory capital and establish higher minimum risk-based capital ratios that require banking organizations to maintain a new minimum "common equity Tier 1" ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% (increased from 4.0%), a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets). The effective date of these requirements for the Company and the Bank was January 1, 2015. 
 In addition, a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of these levels (that is being phased in over three years, which began at 0.625% on January 1, 2016, increased to 1.25% on January 1, 2017, and which will be increased by 0.625% on each of January 1, 2018 and January 1, 2019) will be required for banking institutions to avoid restrictions on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or pay discretionary bonuses. Including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the New Capital Rules would result in the following minimum ratios to be considered well capitalized: (i) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, (ii) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. At December 31, 2016, the respective capital ratios of the Company and the Bank exceeded the minimum percentage requirements to be deemed "well capitalized" for regulatory purposes. 
 In addition, the New Capital Rules include changes in the permitted composition of Tier 1 capital to exclude trust preferred securities subject to certain grandfathering exceptions for organizations like the Company which had less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009, limitations on the amount of mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets permitted to be included in Tier 1 capital, and the required inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities unless the organization opts out of including such unrealized gains and losses. The Company and the Bank made this opt out election. 
 11

   While the New Capital Rules set higher regulatory capital standards for the Company and the Bank, bank regulators may also continue their past policies of expecting banks to maintain additional capital beyond the new minimum requirements. The implementation of the New Capital Rules or more stringent requirements to maintain higher levels of capital or to maintain higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the Company's net income and return on equity, restrict the ability to pay dividends and require the raising of additional capital. Please also see "Capital" under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for disclosure concerning the Company's and Bank's regulatory capital ratios. 
   Prompt Corrective Action Provisions 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards, including requiring the prompt submission of an acceptable capital restoration plan. Depending on the Bank's capital ratios, the agencies' regulations define five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. The prompt corrective action standards were also changed as the New Capital Rules ratios became effective. Under the new standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank will be required to meet the new common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5%, an increased Tier 1 ratio of 8% (increased from 6%), an unchanged total capital ratio of 10% and an unchanged leverage ratio of 5%. 
 At each successive lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to more restrictions, including restrictions on a bank's activities, operational practices or the ability to pay dividends. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. The federal banking agencies also may require banks and bank holding companies subject to enforcement actions to maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum ratios otherwise required to be deemed well capitalized. Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a financial institution could subject a bank or bank holding company to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits and other restrictions on its business. 
   Dividends 
 Under California law, a California corporation such as the Company may make a distribution to its shareholders to the extent that either the corporation's retained earnings meet or exceed the amount of the proposed distribution or the value of the corporation's assets exceed the amount of its liabilities plus the amount of shareholders preferences, if any, and certain other conditions are met. It is the Federal Reserve Board's policy, however, that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization's expected future needs and financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve Board's policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to their banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve Board also discourages dividend payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. 
 12

   The Bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company. The Company depends on the performance of the Bank for funds which may be received as dividends from the Bank for use in the operation of the Company and the ability of the Company to pay dividends to shareholders. Future cash dividends by the Bank will also depend upon management's assessment of future capital requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The New Capital Rules restrict dividend payments by the Bank to the Company if the capital conservation buffer is not achieved. 
 California law limits the ability of the Bank to pay cash dividends to the Company to the lesser of the Bank's retained earnings or net income for its last three fiscal years (less any distributions to shareholders made during such period). If the Bank is unable to pay cash dividends under this test, the Bank may pay cash dividends with the prior approval of the DBO, in an amount not exceeding the greatest of (1) retained earnings of the bank; (2) the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year; or (3) the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year. 
   Deposit Insurance 
 Substantially all of the deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. All FDIC-insured institutions are also required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation ("FICO"), an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017. 
 The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution is based on its asset size and its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors. The Bank is generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance, which can be affected by the cost of bank failures to the FDIC among other factors. Any future increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material and adverse effect on the Bank's earnings and could have a material adverse effect on the value of, or market for, the Company's common stock. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act revised the FDIC's DIF management authority by setting requirements for the DIF's reserve ratio and redefining the assessment base used to calculate banks' quarterly assessments. In 2016, the FDIC adopted a rule increasing the DIF's minimum reserve ratio to 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the cost of increasing the DIF's reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% will be borne by depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. 
   Operations and Consumer Compliance Laws 
 The Bank must comply with numerous federal and state anti-money laundering and consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations, including, but not limited to, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the National Flood Insurance Act, the California Homeowner Bill of Rights and various federal and state privacy protection laws, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, CAN-SPAM Act. Noncompliance with any of these laws could subject the Bank to compliance enforcement actions as well as lawsuits and could also result in administrative penalties, including, fines and reimbursements. The Company and the Bank are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition. 
 13

   These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure and reporting requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, servicing, collecting and foreclosure of loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to enforcement actions, injunctions, fines or criminal penalties, punitive damages to consumers, and the loss of certain contractual rights. 
   CFPB 
 The Dodd Frank Act created the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau ("CFPB") as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve Board with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home equity loans and credit cards. The CFPB's functions include investigating consumer complaints, conducting market research, rulemaking, supervising and examining bank consumer transactions, and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services. CFPB regulations and guidance apply to all financial institutions and banks. Those with $10 billion or more in assets are subject to examination by the CFPB. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets will continue to be examined for compliance by their primary federal banking agency. 
 Bank Holding Company and Bank Regulation 
 The Company and the Bank are subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both federal and state banking laws, including the following: 



 Requirements that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength for their banking
subsidiaries.  In addition, the regulatory agencies have "prompt corrective action" authority to limit activities and order an assessment of a
bank holding company if the capital of a bank subsidiary falls below capital levels required by the regulators. 
 Safety and soundness requirements.  Banks must be operated in a safe and
sound manner and meet standards applicable to internal controls, information systems, internal audit, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, liquidity
management and compensation, as well as other operational and management standards. These safety and soundness requirements give bank regulatory agencies significant latitude in exercising their
supervisory authority and their authority to initiate informal or formal enforcement actions. 
 Requirements for approval of acquisitions and activities.  Prior approval or
non-objection of the applicable federal regulatory agencies is required for most acquisitions and mergers and in order to engage in certain non-banking activities and activities that have been
determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be financial in nature, incidental to financial activities, or complementary to a financial activity. Laws and regulations governing state-chartered banks
contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities. 
 The Community Reinvestment Act (the "CRA").  The CRA requires that banks
help meet the credit needs in their communities, including the availability of credit to low and moderate income neighborhoods and individuals. If the Company or the Bank fails to adequately serve
their communities, penalties may be imposed, including denials of applications for branches, to add subsidiaries and affiliates, or to merge with or purchase other financial institutions. In its last
reported examination by the FDIC in 2015, the Bank received a CRA rating of "Satisfactory."

 The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, and other anti-money laundering
laws.  These laws and regulations require financial institutions to assist U.S. Government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering
and other illegal acts by maintaining policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other suspicious activity. 
 The Volcker Rule.  The "Volcker Rule," which was adopted as part of the
Dodd-Frank Act, prohibits bank holding companies, banks and their affiliated companies from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities and commodity futures for their own
account. The Volcker Rule also limits banking entities' investments in, and other relationships with, hedge funds and private equity funds, although the Federal Reserve Board has extended the
conformance period for certain existing investments to July 2017. The Company and the Bank held no investment positions or fund relationships at December 31, 2016 which were subject to the
final rule and have controls in place to ensure compliance with the Volcker Rule going forward. 
Limitations on the amount of loans to one borrower and to executive officers and
directors.
Limitations on transactions with affiliates.
Restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments in, and ability to underwrite certain
securities.
Requirements for opening of branches intra- and interstate.
Fair lending and truth in lending laws to ensure equal access to credit and to protect consumers in credit
transactions.
Provisions of the federal and state laws dealing with privacy for nonpublic personal information of
customers.

      Item 1A.   Risk Factors 
In the course of conducting its business operations, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to its own business. The following discussion addresses the most significant risks that could affect the Company's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and capital position and stock price. The risks identified below are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all risks faced by the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company is not aware of or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also impair our business. 
   Renewed weakness in economic conditions could have a material and adverse effect on our business. 
 Our performance could be materially and adversely affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions that have a direct or indirect adverse effect on us, our customers and our counterparties. These conditions could result in one of the following: (i) a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us, (ii) a decrease in customer savings generally and a corresponding decrease in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us, and (iii) an increase in the number of customers and counterparties that become delinquent, file for protection under the bankruptcy laws and/or default on their loans and other obligations to us. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of non-performing assets, provisioning for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held-for-sale. 
   We are highly dependent on the real estate market on the Central Coast of California and a renewed downturn in the real estate market may have a material and adverse effect on our business. 
 A significant portion of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate. Although we have seen what we believe are the signs of stabilization in the local economies in which we operate, a renewed decline in economic conditions, the local housing market or rising interest rates could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, the value of real estate and other collateral securing loans or the value of real estate owned by us, any combination of which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, a large portion of the loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate that is subject to risks related to acts of nature, including drought, earthquakes, floods, landslides and fires. To the extent that these events occur, they may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures these loans, which may also materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 16

     Our results of operations and financial condition can be impacted by the effect of the drought in California on our agricultural and related business. 
 The Company provides financing to agricultural businesses and other industries dependent on agriculture in the Central Coast of California. We recognize the cyclical nature of the industry, often caused by fluctuating commodity prices and changing climatic conditions. The Company remains committed to providing credit to agricultural customers and will always have a material exposure to this industry. In addition, the State of California has been experiencing drought conditions since 2013. The lack of rain will have an adverse impact on our agricultural customers' operating costs, crop yields and crop quality, which could impact such customers' ability to repay their loans to us consistent with the terms of such loans. The longer the drought continues, the more significant this impact will become. As a result, the Company's results of operations, financial condition, cash-flows and stock price can be negatively influenced by the impact of the drought on the banking needs of our agricultural customers. 
   We have a concentration in commercial real estate loans. 
 We have a high concentration in commercial real estate ("CRE") loans. CRE loans are defined as construction, land development, other land loans such as farmland, loans secured by multi-family (5 or more units) residential properties and loans secured by non-farm, non-residential properties. Following this definition, approximately 64.9% of our gross loans can be classified as CRE lending as of December 31, 2016. CRE loans generally involve a higher degree of credit risk than certain other types of lending due to, among other things, the generally large amounts loaned to individual borrowers. Losses incurred on loans to a small number of these borrowers could have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, commercial real estate loans generally depend on the cash flow from the property to service the debt. Cash flow may be adversely affected by general economic conditions, which may result in non-performance by certain borrowers. 
   The cost and other effects of the full implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act remain unknown and may have a material and adverse effect on our business. 
 The federal banking agencies continue to implement the remaining requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act as well as promulgating other regulations and guidelines intended to assure the financial strength and safety and soundness of banks and the stability of the U.S. banking system. The full compliance burden and impact of the Dodd Frank Act on the Company's and the Bank's business, financial condition, and results of operations and profitability remain uncertain. 
   Further significant changes in banking laws or regulations, the interpretation of those rules and regulations, and changes in federal monetary policy could materially affect our business. 
 In addition to the Dodd-Frank Act discussed above, the banking industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation. The implementation of new laws or changes in existing laws, including changes in the interpretations of such laws and related rules and regulations by regulators, courts or others, could have a negative impact on our business. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. Significant changes in these laws and regulations and/or the interpretation and enforcement thereof could materially and adversely affect our business. We cannot predict the substance or impact of any change in regulation, whether by regulators or as a result of legislation, or in the way such statutory or regulatory requirements are interpreted or enforced. Compliance with such current and potential regulation may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our business practices, require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. 
 17

   Our business is also impacted by federal monetary policy, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve Board. Federal monetary policy significantly affects our credit conditions, primarily through open market operations in United States government securities, the discount rate for member bank borrowing, and bank reserve requirements. Changes in trade and monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   Implementation of new Basel III capital rules adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies require increased capital levels that we may not be able to satisfy and could impede our growth and profitability. 
 The new Basel III Capital Rules became effective January 1, 2015. The new rules increase minimum capital ratios, add a new minimum common equity ratio, add a new capital conservation buffer, and change the risk-weightings of certain assets. These changes will be phased in through 2019. As the rules are phased in they could have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources and financial condition. See also Item 1. Business  Capital Adequacy Requirements, for a further discussion of Basel III Capital Rules. 
   Our business is subject to credit exposure and our allowance for loan and lease losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses. 
 We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the probability of such borrowers making payments, as well as the value of real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans when considering the adequacy of the Company's allowance. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan and lease losses may be insufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which may adversely impact our operating results. Our regulators, as an integral part of their regular examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase it by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge-offs. Any additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, as required by these regulatory agencies, could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
   The Company's business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect its financial performance. 
 A substantial portion of the Company's income is derived from the differential or "spread" between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest earning assets, and the interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company's control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. As interest rates change, net interest income is affected. With fixed rate assets (such as fixed rate loans and investment securities) and liabilities (such as certificates of deposit), the effect on net interest income depends on the cash flows associated with the maturity of the asset or liability. Asset/liability management policy may not be successfully implemented and from time to time the Company's risk position may not be balanced. An unanticipated rapid decrease or increase in interest rates could have a material and adverse effect on the spreads between the interest rates earned on assets and the rates of interest paid on liabilities, and therefore on the level of net interest income. For instance, any rapid increase in interest rates in the future could result in interest expense increasing faster than interest income because of fixed rate loans and longer term investments. Further, substantially higher interest rates could reduce loan demand and may result in slower loan growth than previously experienced. Any one of these occurrences would have a material and adverse effect on the Company's results of operation and financial condition. Conversely, lower interest rates could lead to lower net interest margin due to maturing loans being financed at a lower rate as well as increased refinancing activity to lock in lower rates. 
 18

     Competition from within and outside the financial services industry may materially and adversely affect our business. 
 The financial services business in our market area is highly competitive. It is becoming increasingly competitive due to changes in regulation, technological advances and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers. We face competition in attracting and retaining core business relationships. Increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services business may reduce our market share, decrease loan demand, cause the prices we charge for our services to fall, resulting in a decline in the rates we charge on loans and/or cause higher rates to be paid on deposits. Therefore, our results may differ in future periods depending upon the nature and level of competition. 
 Additionally, technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions, which historically have involved banks, through alternative methods. For example, consumers can now maintain funds, which would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as "disintermediation," could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
   Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and negatively impact our financial condition. 
 Liquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us. 
   Declines in the market value of our investment portfolio may adversely affect our financial performance, liquidity and capital. 
 We maintain an investment portfolio that includes, but is not limited to, mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities and asset backed securities. The market value of investments in our portfolio has become increasingly volatile over the last few years, largely due to disruptions in the capital markets and fluctuations in long term interest rates. The market value of investments may be affected by factors other than the underlying performance of the servicer of the securities, or the mortgages underlying the securities, such as changes in interest rates, credit ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate, and a lack of liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities. Furthermore, problems at the federal and state government levels may trickle down to municipalities and adversely impact our investment in municipal bonds. 
 On a quarterly basis, we evaluate investments and other assets for impairment. We may be required to record impairment charges if our investments suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. If we determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we would be required to charge the credit-related portion of the other-than-temporary impairment against earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods in which the charges occur. 
 19

     Loss of customer deposits could increase the Company's funding costs. 
 The Company relies on bank deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding. The Company competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If the Company's competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits, the Company's funding costs may increase, either because the Company raises its rates to avoid losing deposits or because the Company loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs reduce the Company's net interest margin and net interest income. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. When customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, the Company may lose a relatively low cost source of funds, increasing the Company's funding costs and reducing the Company's net interest income. 
   Failure to successfully execute our strategic plan may adversely affect our performance. 
 Our financial performance and profitability depend on our ability to execute our corporate strategies. Each year, our board of directors approves our long-term strategic plan and annual operating budget. Our near-term business strategy includes pursuing organic growth within our geographic footprint within the markets we currently serve. Our failure to achieve organic loan and deposit growth in our current market area may adversely impact our near-term financial performance goals. Other factors that may adversely affect our ability to attain our long-term financial performance goals include an inability to control non-interest expense, including, but not limited to, rising employee compensation, regulatory compliance and healthcare costs, limitations imposed on us through regulatory actions, and our inability to increase net interest income due to a continued low interest rate environment as well as competitive pressures within our primary market area. 
   We may not be able to attract and retain skilled people. 
 Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them without offering very high compensation. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material and adverse impact on our business because of the loss of their skills, knowledge of our market and years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. 
 The bank regulatory agencies have published guidance and regulations which limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees. These regulations and guidance may materially and adversely affect our ability to retain key personnel. Due to these restrictions, we may not be able to successfully compete with other larger financial institutions to attract, retain and appropriately incentivize high performing employees. If we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
   The Company faces operational risks that may result in unexpected losses. 
 We are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system failures and errors, customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters. We maintain a system of internal controls to mitigate against such occurrences and maintain insurance coverage for such risks that are insurable, but should such an event occur that is not prevented or detected by our internal controls, or is uninsured or in excess of applicable insurance limits, it could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 20

     Our controls and procedures could fail or be circumvented. 
 Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurances of the effectiveness of these systems and controls, and that the objectives of these controls have been met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, and any failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
   The occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches of our information security or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Information technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits, and loans. As a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our clients' information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation, or damage to our reputation. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. 
 Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, computer viruses, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our clients, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyberattacks. In recent periods, there continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Consistent with industry trends, we have also experienced an increase in attempted electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents in recent periods. Moreover, in the past year, several large corporations, including retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, where in some cases, exposing sensitive financial and other personal information of their clients and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity. Some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which increase their risks of identity theft, credit card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with the Bank. 
 21

   Information pertaining to us and our clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on our networks and systems, those of our clients and certain of our third party partners, such as our online banking or reporting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our clients against fraud and security breaches and to maintain our clients' confidence. Increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our clients and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our clients to access our systems. Although we have developed, and continue to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our security, the inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in: losses to us or our clients; our loss of business and/or clients; damage to our reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; disruption to our business, and/or our ability to grow our online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or exposure to civil litigation or possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 To date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks or attempted breaches, or incur such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature and growth of these threats, our plans to continue to implement and increase Internet and mobile banking to meet customer demand, and the current economic and political environment. As cyber and other data security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. 
   The potential for fraud when regularly dealing with credit cards, debit cards, prepaid cards, and ACH transactions is significant. 
 Issuers of credit, debit and prepaid cards and other industry participants, as well as depository institutions participating in the ACH network have suffered significant losses in recent years with respect to the theft of personal, financial and confidential data that has been illegally exploited for personal gain. In addition, we operate a number of electronic, check and other payment connections that are vulnerable to individuals engaging in fraudulent activities that seek to compromise payments and related financial systems illegally. The theft of such information is regularly reported and affects not only individuals but businesses as well. In recent years, losses from such fraud have been substantial. Although fraud has not had a material impact on the profitability of the Bank, it is possible that such activity could adversely impact it in the future. 
 Further, the Company may be affected by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who participate in data interchanges with us and our customers that involve the theft of customer credit and debit card data, which may include the theft of the Company's debit card PIN numbers and commercial card information used to make purchases at such retailers and other third parties. Such data breaches could result in us incurring significant expenses to reissue debit cards and cover losses, which could result in a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. 
 22



  The Company is subject to significant financial and reputational risks from potential legal liability and regulatory action. 
 We face significant legal risks in our business, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against other financial institutions remain high. Increased litigation costs, substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to the Company, which in turn could adversely impact its business prospects. 
   Impairment of goodwill or intangible assets would result in a charge to earnings. 
 Goodwill and intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. We may be required to record a charge to earnings during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or intangibles is determined. 
   Necessary changes in technology could be costly. 
 The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. 
 We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   The Company relies on third party service providers for key systems, placing us and our customers at risk if the vendor has service outages, work stoppages or is subjected to attacks on their IT systems that expose information relating to us and our customers. 
 The Company uses a third party software service provider to perform all of its transaction data processing. The Company also outsources other customer service applications, such as on-line banking, ACH and wire transfers, to third party vendors. If these service providers were to experience technical difficulties or incur any extended outages in services, it could have a material and adverse impact on the Company and its customers. Because such service providers service us and other banks, their systems could be affected by denial of service attacks directed at their other bank customers. In addition, third parties may seek to penetrate our vendors' IT systems, obtain information about us or our customers or access our customers' accounts, and exploit that information to wrongfully withdraw or transfer our customers' funds, which could have material and adverse impacts on our customers and the Company. Further, if the Company was required to switch service providers due to deterioration in service quality or other factors, there is no guarantee that it could obtain comparable services at a comparable price. 
 23

     Our operations face severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external risks. 
 Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base; impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. The Central Coast of California is subject to earthquakes, droughts, fires, floods and landslides. Operations in our market could be disrupted by both the evacuation of large portions of the population as well as damage and or lack of access to our banking and operation facilities. The local market that the Company serves is also currently facing drought conditions which could not only impact the largest industry in our market footprint, agriculture, but could have rippling effects on other industries, including hospitality. The occurrence of any such event could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   Maintaining our reputation as a community bank is critical to our success and the failure to do so may materially and adversely affect our performance. 
 We are a community bank and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, or otherwise, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. 
   We may enter into new lines of business or offer new products and services which expose us to additional risk or which are not successful. 
 We may enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services as new opportunities arise or as our business strategy changes. New lines of business or new products or services may involve significant business, reputational or regulatory risk, including increased regulatory scrutiny. The success of these efforts depends on many factors, including the competitive landscape, market adoption and successful implementation. We may experience significant losses to the extent that we invest significant time and resources to a new line of business, product or service and it is not successful. There can be no assurance that we can successfully manage these risks and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
   Changes in accounting standards or tax legislation could have a negative impact on our business. 
 Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements or elected representatives approve changes to tax laws that could affect our corporate taxes. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. 
   We depend on cash dividends from the Bank to meet our cash obligations. 
 As a holding company, dividends from our subsidiary bank provide a substantial portion of our cash flow used to service the interest payments on our trust preferred securities and any cash dividends to our shareholders. Various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to us without regulatory approval. If the Bank is unable to generate the profits necessary to service the interest payments, or we are unable to obtain regulatory approval to make dividends from the Bank to the Company, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. 
 24

     The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us. 
 Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
   Because the market price of PPBI common stock will fluctuate, the Company's shareholders cannot be sure of the exact value of the consideration they will receive in the Corporate Merger. 
 Upon the effective time of the Corporate Merger, each share of Company common stock will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, consisting of shares of PPBI common stock pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The value of the merger consideration to be received by Company shareholders will be based on an exchange ratio, which is fixed at 0.3471 shares of PPBI common stock for each share of Company common stock. Because the price of PPBI common stock could fluctuate during the period of time between the Company special meeting and the time the Company's shareholders actually receive their shares of PPBI common stock as merger consideration, the Company's shareholders will be subject to the risk of a decline in the price of PPBI common stock during this period. The Company does not have the right to terminate the Merger Agreement or to re-solicit the vote of its shareholders solely because of changes in the market prices of PPBI common stock. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in the values and perceptions of financial services stocks generally and PPBI in particular, changes in PPBI's business, operations and prospects and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond PPBI's control. Accordingly, at the time of the Company special meeting, the Company's shareholders will not know or be able to calculate the exact value of the shares of PPBI common stock they will receive upon completion of the Corporate Merger. 
   Directors and officers of the Company have some interests in the Announced Transaction that are in addition to or different than the interests of the Company's shareholders. 
 The Company's directors and officers have interests in the Announced Transaction as individuals that are in addition to, or different from, their interests as shareholders of the Company, which are:
 


 The Company's directors and officers will receive, upon consummation of the Announced Transaction, options to acquire PPBI common stock in
substitution of their Company options; in addition, directors and officers of the Company or its subsidiaries who will be retained by PPBI or its subsidiaries following the consummation of the
Announced Transaction, will receive, upon consummation of the Announced Transaction, restricted shares of PPBI common stock in substitution of their Company restricted stock, and restricted stock
units of PPBI in substitution of their Company restricted stock units; directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries who will not be retained by PPBI or its subsidiaries following the
consummation of the Announced Transaction will have the vesting of their Company stock options, Company restricted stock and Company restricted stock units accelerated and (i) the Company
restricted stock shall be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration and (ii) the cash-settled Company restricted stock units shall be converted into the right to receive
cash; officers of the Company, whether or not retained, holding performance-based Company restricted stock units will receive cash for such awards; 


 25

   


 The agreement of PPBI to honor indemnification obligations of the Company for a period of six (6) years, as well as to purchase
liability insurance for the Company's directors and officers for six (6) years following the merger, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement; 
 Cash payments to certain officers of the Company in the aggregate amount of approximately $4.75 million, on a pre-tax basis, pursuant to
the terms of their respective employment-related agreements with the Company; 
 The appointment of Simone Lagomarsino, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Heritage Oaks Bank, Michael Morris, the
Chairman of the Board of the Company and Heritage Oaks Bank, and Michael Pfau, the Vice Chairman of the Board of the Company and Heritage Oaks Bank, to serve on the boards of directors of PPBI and
Pacific Premier Bank effective upon completion of the merger; 
 Robert Osterbauer, Executive Vice President and commercial banking division Manager, North and Agribusiness Lending, with Heritage Oaks Bank,
and Brooks Wise, Executive Vice President and commercial banking division Manager, South, with Heritage Oaks Bank, have entered into employment agreements with Pacific Premier Bank, which will each be
effective upon the closing of the Corporate Merger, which provide compensation to those individuals for continued provision of services to, or employment with, Pacific Premier Bank following the Bank
Merger; and 
 Effective as of the closing of the Corporate Merger, PPBI will establish a Community Advisory Board for the Central Coast Region, which shall
be comprised of all members of the Company's board of directors as of the closing of the Corporate Merger who are willing to so serve and no additional compensation will paid for service on the
Community Advisory Board. 


 The Company and PPBI boards of directors were aware of these interests and considered them, among other things, in their approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 
   The termination fee and the restrictions on solicitation contained in the Merger Agreement may discourage other companies from trying to acquire the Company. 
 Until the completion of the Corporate Merger, with some limited exceptions, the Company is prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or participating in any discussion of or otherwise considering any inquiries or proposals that may lead to an acquisition proposal, such as a merger or other business combination transaction, with any person other than PPBI. In addition, the Company has agreed to pay a termination fee to PPBI in specified circumstances. These provisions could discourage other companies from trying to acquire the Company even though those other companies might be willing to offer greater value to the Company's shareholders than PPBI has offered in the Announced Transaction. The payment of the termination fee could also have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition. 
   PPBI may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Announced Transaction. 
 The success of the Announced Transaction will depend on, among other things, PPBI's ability to realize the anticipated revenue enhancements and efficiencies and to combine the businesses of PPBI and the Company in a manner that does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of the Company or result in decreased revenues resulting from any loss of customers and that permits growth opportunities to occur. If PPBI is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. 
 26

   PPBI and the Company have operated and, until the completion of the Announced Transaction, will continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect PPBI's ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Announced Transaction. Integration efforts between the two companies could also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of PPBI and the Company during the transition period and on the combined company following completion of the merger. 
   The market price of PPBI common stock after the Announced Transaction may be affected by factors different from those affecting the shares of the Company or PPBI currently. 
 Upon completion of the Corporate Merger, holders of Company common stock will become holders of PPBI common stock. PPBI's business differs from that of the Company, and, accordingly, the financial condition and results of operations of the combined company and the market price of PPBI common stock after the completion of the Announced Transaction may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the financial condition and results of operations of the Company or PPBI on a standalone basis. 
   The fairness opinion received by PPBI's board of directors from its financial advisor, D.A. Davidson, and the fairness opinion received by the Company's board of directors from the Company's financial advisor, Sandler O'Neill, will not be updated to reflect any changes since the date of such opinions. 
 Changes in the operations and prospects of PPBI or the Company, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of PPBI and/or the Company may alter the value of PPBI or the Company or the market price for shares of PPBI common stock or Company common stock by the time the Announced Transaction is completed. Neither the fairness opinion delivered by D.A. Davidson to the PPBI board of directors nor the fairness opinion delivered by Sandler O'Neill to the Company board of directors speaks as of any date other than the date of such opinion, which was December 12, 2016 in the case of D.A. Davidson's opinion, and December 11, 2016 in the case of Sandler O'Neill's opinion. The Merger Agreement does not require that either D.A. Davidson's or Sandler O'Neill's fairness opinion be updated as a condition to the completion of the Announced Transaction, and neither PPBI nor the Company intends to request that the respective fairness opinions be updated. 
   The Announced Transaction is subject to the receipt of approvals or waivers from regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on PPBI. 
 Before the Announced Transaction can be completed, various approvals or waivers must be obtained from bank regulatory authorities. Regulatory approval or waivers are not guaranteed and even if granted, the bank regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the completion of the Announced Transaction or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Although PPBI and the Company do not currently expect that any such conditions or changes will be imposed, there can be no assurance that they will not be, and such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger, imposing additional costs on, or limiting the revenues of PPBI following the merger or causing the Announced Transaction between PPBI and HEOP to terminate.

     The Announced Transaction cannot be completed unless the PPBI shareholders approve the issuance of PPBI common stock in the merger and the Company's shareholders approve the Merger Agreement. 
 In order for the Announced Transaction to be completed, the PPBI shareholders must approve the issuance of PPBI common stock in the Announced Transaction and the Company shareholders must approve the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. While a vote of PPBI's shareholders is not required to approve the Announced Transaction, the approval of PPBI's shareholders is required under applicable NASDAQ rules in order for PPBI to be authorized to issue the shares of PPBI common stock to the Company's shareholders as the merger consideration. Approval of the issuance of PPBI common stock to the Company stockholders under NASDAQ rules requires approval of at least a majority of the total votes cast at the PPBI special meeting. The approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company's shareholders requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock. If either or both of these required votes is not obtained from the shareholders of each of the respective companies, the merger may not be consummated. 
   The Announced Transaction is subject to certain closing conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, will result in the Announced Transaction not being completed, which may cause the prices of PPBI common stock and the Company's common stock to decline. 
 Consummation of the Announced Transaction is subject to customary conditions to closing in addition to the receipt of the required regulatory approvals and approval of the Company's shareholders of the Merger Agreement and the approval of PPBI's shareholders of the issuance of PPBI common stock in connection with the Announced Transaction. If any condition to the Announced Transaction is not satisfied or waived, to the extent permitted by law, the Announced Transaction will not be completed. In addition, PPBI and the Company may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances even if the Merger Agreement is approved by the Company's shareholders and the issuance of PPBI common stock in connection with the Announced Transaction is approved by PPBI's shareholders, including if the merger has not been completed on or before August 30, 2017. If the merger is not completed, the respective trading prices of PPBI common stock and Company common stock on the NASDAQ Global Stock Market may decline to the extent that the current prices reflect a market assumption that the Announced Transaction will be completed. In addition, neither company would realize any of the expected benefits of having completed the Announced Transaction. 
   The unaudited condensed pro forma combined financial data included in the joint proxy statement/prospectus are presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of the combined company's financial condition or results of operations following the Announced Transaction. 
 The unaudited condensed pro forma combined financial data contained in the joint proxy statement/prospectus are presented for illustrative purposes only, are based on various adjustments, assumptions and preliminary estimates and may not be an indication of the combined company's financial condition or results of operations following the Announced Transaction for several reasons. The actual financial condition and results of operations of the combined company following the Merger may not be consistent with, or evident from, these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data. In addition, the assumptions used in preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect the combined company's financial condition or results of operations following the merger. Any potential decline in the combined company's financial condition or results of operations may cause significant variations in the stock price of the combined company. 
 28

     The shares of PPBI common stock to be received by Company shareholders as a result of the Announced Transaction will have different rights than shares of the Company's common stock. 
 Upon completion of the Announced Transaction, the Company's shareholders will become PPBI shareholders and their rights as shareholders will be governed by the PPBI amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the PPBI amended and restated bylaws and Delaware General Corporation Law. The rights associated with Company common stock are different from the rights associated with PPBI common stock. 
   We will be subject to contractual restrictions and business uncertainties while the merger with PPBI is pending. 
 Although there is no assurance as to the exact timing, the merger currently is expected to close at the end of the first quarter of 2017 or early in the second quarter of 2017. The Merger Agreement requires us to operate in the ordinary course of business pending the Merger's completion, but restricts us from certain activities, including making acquisitions or opening of new branches, divestitures, issuance of securities and other customary restrictions without PPBI's consent. These restrictions may limit or prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger, and which we might pursue absent the Merger Agreement. 
 Uncertainty about the effects of the merger, including branch consolidation and any divestitures that may be required, on our employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us. Certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. These uncertainties may make it more difficult for us to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause our customers and others that deal with us to consider changing existing business relationships with us. It is not unusual for competitors to use mergers as an opportunity to seek the merging parties' customers and to hire certain of their staffs. If key employees depart the Corporation or the Bank in light of uncertainty over the merger or our integration efforts with PPBI, our business could be adversely affected. 
   Termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively affect us. 
 If, for any reason, the Merger Agreement is terminated, our business may be adversely affected as a result of not pursuing other beneficial opportunities prior to such termination and our management focus on completing the merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and our board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, we may not be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration PPBI has agreed to provide in the merger, especially if the termination fee of $15.0 million becomes payable as a result.
