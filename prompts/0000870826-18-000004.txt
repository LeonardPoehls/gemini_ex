Item 1. Business
When we refer to "we," "our," "us" or the "Company," we mean EVINE Live Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. EVINE Live Inc. is a Minnesota corporation with principal and executive offices located at 6740 Shady Oak Road, Eden Prairie, Minnesota 55344-3433. EVINE Live Inc. was incorporated on June 25, 1990. 
The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31 and results in either a 52-week or 53-week fiscal year. Our most recently completed fiscal year, fiscal 2017, ended on February 3, 2018, and consisted of 53 weeks. Fiscal 2016 ended on January 28, 2017 and consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal 2015 ended on January 30, 2016 and consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal 2018 will end on February 2, 2019 and will consist of 52 weeks.
A. General 
We are a multiplatform interactive digital commerce company that offers a mix of proprietary, exclusive and name-brand merchandise in the categories of jewelry & watches, home & consumer electronics, beauty and fashion & accessories directly to consumers in an engaging and informative shopping experience via television, online and mobile devices. Evine reaches more than 87 million television homes, primarily on cable and satellite systems, with entertaining content in a comprehensive digital shopping experience 24 hours a day. In addition, we also operate evine.com, a comprehensive digital commerce platform that sells products which appear on our television shopping network as well as an extended assortment of online-only merchandise. Our programming and products are also marketed via mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, and through the leading social media channels.
On November 18, 2014, we announced that we had changed our corporate name to EVINE Live Inc. from ValueVision Media, Inc. Effective November 20, 2014, our NASDAQ trading symbol also changed to EVLV from VVTV. We transitioned from doing business as "ShopHQ" and rebranded to "Evine Live", "Evine" and evine.com on February 14, 2015. 
In May 2013, we previously announced a rebranding of our 24-hour television shopping network and digital commerce internet website from ShopNBC and ShopNBC.com to ShopHQ and ShopHQ.com, respectively.
Multiplatform Video Commerce Retailing 
The primary form of our multiplatform interactive digital commerce retail business is our 24-hour television shopping network, Evine, which is the third largest television shopping network in the United States. Our comprehensive online website, evine.com, complements our network with a combination of products featured on TV as well as a strong collection of online-only products. Consolidated net sales, including shipping and handling revenues, totaled $648.2 million, $666.2 million and $693.3 million for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. We have several convenient methods for a customer to purchase items they want, including our toll-free telephone number, directly online, or using mobile devices. Our television programming is primarily produced at our Eden Prairie, Minnesota headquarters facility and we also produce programming remotely on location during special events. The programming is transmitted nationally via satellite to cable system operators, direct-to-home satellite providers, broadcast television station operators, a full-power television station in Boston and over-the-top platforms.
Products and Product Mix 
Products sold on our digital commerce platforms include jewelry & watches; home & consumer electronics; beauty; and fashion & accessories. Historically jewelry & watches has been our largest merchandise category. While changes in our product mix have occurred as a result of customer demand and other factors including our efforts to diversify our offerings within our major merchandise categories, jewelry & watches remained our largest merchandise category in fiscal 2017. We are focused on diversifying our merchandise assortment within our existing product categories as well as by offering potentially new complementary product categories. We also regularly review the proprietary, exclusive and name-brands we offer within each product category to ensure we have fresh and compelling products which we believe will increase our revenues and grow our active customer base. The following table shows our merchandise mix as a percentage of consolidated net merchandise sales for the years indicated by product category group. 

Net Merchandise Sales by Category | Fiscal 2017 | Fiscal 2016 | Fiscal 2015
Jewelry & Watches | 39% | 41% | 39% 
Home & Consumer Electronics | 27% | 25% | 31% 
Beauty | 16% | 16% | 14% 
Fashion & Accessories | 18% | 18% | 16%

Jewelry & Watches.  We feature a broad assortment of jewelry from fine to fashion, silver to gold, genuine gemstones to simulated diamonds. In addition, we offer an extensive collection of men’s and women’s watches from classic to modern designs.
Home & Consumer Electronics.  We feature home décor, bed and bath textiles, cookware, kitchen electrics, tabletop accessories and home furnishings. With consumer electronics, we offer current technology trends and solutions to consumers from some of the world's most recognized brands.
Beauty.  Our assortment features a variety of skincare, cosmetics, hair care and bath & body products.
Fashion & Accessories.  We offer fashionable looks that strike a balance between current trends and essentials with an assortment of apparel, outerwear, intimates, handbags, accessories and footwear.
B. Company Strategy 
As a multiplatform video commerce company, our strategy includes offering an exciting assortment of proprietary, exclusive (i.e., products that are not readily available elsewhere) and name-brand products using our video commerce infrastructure, which includes television access to more than 87 million homes in the United States, primarily on cable and satellite systems. We are also focused on growing our high lifetime value customer file and growing our revenues, through social, mobile, online, and over-the-top platforms. 
Our merchandising plan is focused on delivering a balanced assortment of profitable proprietary, exclusive and name-brand products presented in an engaging, entertaining, shopping-centric format. To enhance the shopping experience for our customers, we will continue to work hard to engage our customers intelligently by leveraging the use of predictive analytics and interactive marketing to drive personalization and relevancy to each experience. In addition, we will continue to find new methods, territories, technologies and channels to distribute our video commerce programming beyond the television screen, including "live on location" entertainment and enhancing our social advertising. We believe these initiatives will position us as a multiplatform interactive digital commerce company that delivers a more engaging and enjoyable customer experience with sales and service that exceed customer expectations. 
C. Television Program Distribution and Online Operations
Our television programming continues to be the most significant medium through which we reach our customers, and we believe that our television shopping program is a key driver of traffic to our evine.com website and mobile platforms. Our online business represents an important component of our future growth opportunities, and we will continue to invest in and enhance our online-based capabilities and mobile presence. Consolidated net sales, including shipping and handling revenues, totaled $648.2 million, $666.2 million and $693.3 million for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. Our digital sales penetration, or, the percentage of net sales that are generated from our evine.com website and mobile platforms, which are primarily ordered directly online, was 51.9%, 49.5% and 46.9% in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. Our mobile penetration increased to 49.9%, 45.4% and 42.3% of total online sales during fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. 
Television Shopping Network
Satellite Delivery of Programming.  Our television programming is presently distributed via communications satellite transponder to cable systems and direct-to-home satellite providers and a full-power television station in Boston. We have a long-term satellite lease agreement with our present provider of satellite services. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, we distribute our television programming via a satellite that was launched in August 2005. The agreement provides us, under certain circumstances, with preemptible back-up services if satellite transmission is interrupted.
Television Distribution.  We operate under distribution agreements with cable operators, direct-to-home satellite providers and telecommunications companies to distribute our television programming over their systems. The terms of the distribution agreements typically range from one to five years. During any fiscal year, certain agreements with cable, satellite or other distributors may expire. Under certain circumstances, we or our distributors may cancel the agreements prior to their expiration. The distribution agreements generally provide that we will pay each operator a monthly access fee, and in some cases marketing support payments, based on the number of homes receiving our programming. We frequently review distribution opportunities with cable system operators and broadcast stations providing for full- or part-time carriage of our programming.
During fiscal 2017, there were approximately 122 million homes in the United States with at least one television set. Of those homes, there were approximately 58 million cable television subscribers, approximately 32 million direct-to-home satellite subscribers and approximately 10 million homes which receive programming through telecommunications companies, such as AT&T and Verizon. 
 5

Our 24-hour television shopping networks, Evine and Evine Too, which are distributed primarily on cable and satellite systems, reached more than 87 million homes, or full time equivalent subscribers (“FTEs”), during fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. 
Online Presence
Our website, evine.com, as well as our mobile platform, provide customers with a shop anytime, anywhere experience and offers a broad array of consumer merchandise, including all products featured on our television programming as well as merchandise found only on evine.com. The website includes additional resources, including a live stream of our television programming, an archive of segments of recent past programming, videos of many individual products that the customer can view on demand, an online program guide, customer-generated product reviews as well as information about our Evine show hosts and guest personalities. The FCC has required that all full-length television programming redistributed over the internet is captioned, and it is considering requiring captioning of programming segments. We currently provide closed captioning on full-length programming redistributed over the internet and a limited amount of programming segments.
Our e-commerce activities are subject to a number of general business regulations and laws regarding taxation and online commerce. There have been continuing efforts to increase the legal and regulatory obligations and restrictions on companies conducting commerce through the internet, primarily in the areas of taxation, consumer privacy and protection of consumer personal information. A number of states impose data security requirements on companies that collect certain types of information concerning their residents and other states may adopt similar requirements in the future. A patchwork of state laws imposing differing security requirements depending on the residence of our customers could impose added compliance costs.
In November 2002, a number of states approved a multi-state agreement to simplify state sales tax laws by establishing one uniform system to administer and collect sales taxes on traditional retailers and electronic commerce merchants (“Remote Sellers”). The agreement became effective on October 3, 2005. To date, 24 of the 45 states that impose sales tax have passed conforming legislation. A number of states and the U.S. Congress are considering other legislative initiatives that would impose enhanced tax collection obligations for Remote Sellers. In January 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States agreed to hear a case (South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.) which could dramatically increase the ability of states to impose sales tax collection responsibilities on Remote Sellers including the Company. We cannot predict the outcome of this case or whether individual states or the U.S. Congress will enact legislation requiring retailers such as us to collect and remit sales taxes on electronic commerce transactions in additional jurisdictions. We already collect and remit sales tax in the several states where we have determined that we are required to do so under current law, and continue to monitor state requirements. 
There are a number of federal laws that limit our ability to pursue certain direct marketing activities, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, and the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or the CAN-SPAM Act. The statutes govern when and how we may contact consumers through various communication methods, including email, phone calls, faxes and texts, in some cases requiring consent and in others allowing a consumer to opt out of certain communications. These types of regulation may limit our ability to pursue certain direct marketing activities, thus potentially limiting our sales and number of customers.
Changes in consumer protection laws also may impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business online. The adoption of additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet or other online services, which could, in turn, decrease the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business through the internet.
In addition, since our website is available over the internet in all states, various states may claim that we are required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in such state, a requirement that could result in fees and taxes as well as penalties for the failure to comply. Any new legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and other online services could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business in this area.
D. Relationship with GE Equity, Comcast and NBCU 
Until April 29, 2016, we were a party to an amended and restated shareholder agreement, dated February 25, 2009 (the “GE/NBCU Shareholder Agreement”), with GE Capital Equity Investments, Inc. (“GE Equity”) and NBCUniversal Media, LLC (“NBCU”), which provided for certain corporate governance and standstill matters. We have a significant cable distribution agreement with Comcast, of which NBCU is an indirect subsidiary, and believe that the terms of the agreement are comparable to those with other cable system operators. 
In an SEC filing made on August 18, 2015 (SEC File No. 005-41757), GE Equity disclosed that on August 14, 2015, GE Equity and ASF Radio, who was an independent third party to us as of that time, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which GE Equity agreed to sell 3,545,049 shares of our common stock, which was all of the shares GE Equity had then owned, 
 6

to ASF Radio for $2.15 per share. According to the SEC filing, ASF Radio is an affiliate of Ardian, an independent private equity investment company. The closing of this sale (the “GE/ASF Radio Sale”) occurred on April 29, 2016. In connection with the GE/ASF Radio Sale, the GE/NBCU Shareholder Agreement was terminated and we entered into a new Shareholder Agreement (the “NBCU Shareholder Agreement”) with NBCU described below.
Stock Purchase from NBCU 
On January 31, 2017, we purchased from NBCU 4,400,000 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 6.7% of shares then outstanding, for approximately $5 million or $1.12 per share pursuant to a Repurchase Letter Agreement between us and NBCU. Immediately following our share purchase, NBCU's direct equity ownership of our shares consisted of 2,741,849 shares of common stock, or 4.5% of our outstanding common stock. As of February 3, 2018, we believe that NBCU sold its remaining shares of our common stock. The NBCU Shareholder Agreement was terminated pursuant to the Repurchase Letter Agreement.
NBCU Shareholder Agreement
We were a party to the NBCU Shareholder Agreement until it was terminated pursuant to the Repurchase Letter Agreement on January 31, 2017. The NBCU Shareholder Agreement replaced the GE/NBCU Shareholder Agreement. The NBCU Shareholder Agreement provided that as long as NBCU or its affiliates beneficially own at least 5% of our outstanding common stock, NBCU was entitled to designate one individual to be nominated to our Board of Directors. In addition, the NBCU Shareholder Agreement provided that NBCU was able to designate its director designee to be an observer of the audit, human resources and compensation, and corporate governance and nominating committees of our Board of Directors. In addition, the NBCU Shareholder Agreement required us to obtain the consent of NBCU prior to our adoption or amendment of any shareholder’s rights plan or certain other actions that would impede or restrict the ability of NBCU to acquire our voting stock or our taking any action that would result in NBCU being deemed to be in violation of the Federal Communications Commission multiple ownership regulations.
The NBCU Shareholder Agreement also provided that unless NBCU beneficially owned less than 5% or more than 90% of the adjusted outstanding shares of common stock, NBCU could not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any securities of the Company subject to limited exceptions for (i) transfers to affiliates, (ii) third party tender offers, (iii) mergers, consolidations and reorganizations and (iv) transfers pursuant to underwritten public offerings or transfers exempt from registration under the Securities Act (provided, in the case of (iv), such transfers would not result in the transferee acquiring beneficial ownership in excess of 20%). 
Registration Rights Agreement
On February 25, 2009, we entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement that, as further amended, provided GE Equity, NBCU and their affiliates and any transferees and assigns, an aggregate of five demand registrations and unlimited piggy-back registration rights. In connection with the GE/ASF Radio Sale, an amendment to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement was entered into removing GE Equity as a party and adding ASF Radio as a party. 
2015 Letter Agreement with GE Equity
On July 9, 2015, we entered into a letter agreement with GE Equity (the “GE Letter Agreement”) pursuant to which GE Equity consented to our adoption of a Shareholder Rights Plan in consideration for our agreement to provide GE Equity, NBCU and certain of their respective affiliates with exemptions from the Shareholder Rights Plan. GE Equity’s consent was required pursuant to the terms of the GE/NBCU Shareholder Agreement. This discussion is a summary of the terms of the letter agreement. In the GE Letter Agreement, we agreed that if any of GE Equity, NBCU or any of their respective affiliates that holds shares of our common stock from time to time (each a “Grandfathered Investor”) sells or otherwise transfers shares of our common stock currently owned by such Grandfathered Investor to any third party identified to us in writing (any such third party, an “Exempt Purchaser”), we will take all actions necessary under the Shareholder Rights Plan so that such third party will not be deemed an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Shareholder Rights Plan) by virtue of the acquisition of such shares. We further agreed that, subject to certain limitations, upon request of any Grandfathered Investor or Exempt Purchaser, and in connection with a transfer by such Grandfathered Investor or Exempt Purchaser of shares of our common stock to an Exempt Purchaser, we will enter into an agreement with the acquiring Exempt Purchaser granting such acquiring Exempt Purchaser substantially the same rights as set forth above with respect to any sale of our outstanding shares of common stock to any other third party. Additionally, we agreed that without the consent of any Grandfathered Investor that is an affiliate of GE Equity and any Grandfathered Investor that is an affiliate of NBCU, we will not (i) amend the Shareholder Rights Plan in any material respect, other than to accelerate the Expiration Date (as defined in the Shareholder Rights Plan) or the Final Expiration Date (as defined in the Shareholder Rights Plan), (ii) adopt another shareholders' rights plan or (iii) amend the letter agreement.

E. Marketing and Merchandising 
Television and Online Retailing
Our television and online revenues are generated from sales of merchandise offered through our interactive digital platforms, which includes cable and satellite television, online at evine.com, mobile devices and social media channels. Our television shopping business utilizes live and selected taped television programming 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to create an interactive, entertaining, and engaging experience that brings our merchandise to life through demonstration. Our product strategy is to continue to develop and expand new product offerings across multiple merchandise categories based on customer demand, as well as to offer competitive pricing and special values in order to attract new customers and optimize margin dollars per minute. Our core video commerce customers - those who interact with our network and transact through television, online and mobile devices - are primarily women between the ages of 45 and 70. We also have a strong presence of male customers of a similar age range. We believe our customers make purchases based on our unique products, quality merchandise and value. We develop our programming schedule with product categories that appeal to specific viewer and customer profiles targeting days of week and times of day they are most likely to be viewing our network. We feature announced and unannounced promotions to drive interest and incremental sales, including "Today’s Top Value," a sales promotion that features a special offer every day. In addition, we also feature major and special promotional events and inventory-clearance sales during different times of the year.
We continually introduce new products that are easily accessible to customers via our television, online and mobile platforms. Inventory sources include manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and importers. We intend to continue to develop and promote proprietary brands and exclusive products, which generally have higher margins than widely sold merchandise, across multiple product categories.
Evine Private Label Consumer Credit Card Program
 We have a private label consumer credit card program (the "Program"). The Program is made available to all qualified consumers to finance Evine purchases and provides benefits including instant purchase credits, free or reduced shipping promotions throughout the year and promotional low-interest financing on qualifying purchases. We believe use of the Evine credit card furthers customer loyalty, reduces total credit card expense and reduces the Company’s overall bad debt exposure since Synchrony Financial ("Synchrony"), the issuing bank for the program, bears the risk of non-payment on Evine credit card transactions except those in our ValuePay installment payment program. In July 2017, we extended the Program through 2020 by entering into a Private Label Consumer Credit Card Program Agreement Amendment with Synchrony. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, customer use of the private label consumer credit card accounted for approximately 21%, 20% and 18% of our television and online sales. 
Synchrony was previously indirectly majority-owned by the General Electric Company ("GE"), which is also the parent company of GE Equity. Prior to GE Equity's sale of our common stock to ASF Radio on April 29, 2016, GE Equity had a beneficial ownership in us and had certain rights as further described under "Relationship with GE Equity, Comcast and NBCU".
Purchasing Terms 
We obtain products for our interactive digital commerce businesses from domestic and foreign manufacturers and/or their suppliers and are often able to make purchases on more favorable terms due to the volume of products purchased or sold. Some of our purchasing arrangements with our vendors include inventory terms that allow for return privileges for a portion of the order or stock balancing. We generally do not have long-term commitments with our vendors, and a variety of sources are available for each category of merchandise sold. During fiscal 2017, products purchased from one vendor accounted for approximately 15% of our consolidated net sales. We believe that we could find alternative products for this vendor’s merchandise assortment if this vendor ceased supplying merchandise; however, the unanticipated loss of any large supplier could negatively impact our sales and earnings.
F. Order Entry, Fulfillment and Customer Service
Our products are available for purchase via toll-free telephone numbers, on our website and through mobile platforms. We maintain agreements with third party service providers to support us with volume peaks in demand for telephone order-entry operators and automated order-processing services to take customer orders. We receive orders with our own home-based phone agents, agents at our Bowling Green, Kentucky distribution center, and at our Eden Prairie, Minnesota corporate headquarters. 
We own an approximately 600,000 square foot distribution facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky, used primarily for the fulfillment of customer orders for merchandise purchased and sold by us and for certain call center operations. 
 8

During fiscal 2014, we began a significant operational expansion initiative with respect to overall warehousing capacity and new equipment and system technology upgrades at our Bowling Green, Kentucky distribution facility. During fiscal 2015, we expanded our 262,000 square foot facility to our current approximately 600,000 square foot facility and moved out of our leased satellite warehouse space. The updated facilities and technology upgrade included a new high-speed parcel shipping and item sortation system coupled with a new warehouse management system to support our increased level of shipments and units and a new call center facility to better serve our customers. The new sortation and warehouse management systems were phased into production through fiscal 2016. 
The majority of customer purchases are paid for by credit or debit cards, including our private label credit card discussed above. Purchases and installment charges made with the Evine private label credit card are non-recourse to us, however, we still maintain credit collection risk from the potential inability to collect future ValuePay installments. Our ValuePay program is an interest-free installment payment program which allows customers to pay by credit card for certain merchandise in two or more equal monthly installments. The percentage of our net sales in which our customer utilized our ValuePay payment program over the past three fiscal years ranged from 68% to 72%. We intend to continue to sell merchandise using the ValuePay program due to its significant promotional value. 
We maintain a product inventory, which consists primarily of consumer merchandise held for resale. The product inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or realizable value. As of February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, we had inventory balances of $68.8 million and $70.2 million. We do not have any material amounts of backlog orders.
Merchandise is shipped to customers by the United States Postal Service, UPS, Federal Express or other recognized carriers. We also have arrangements with certain vendors who drop-ship merchandise directly to our customers after an approved customer order is processed.
We perform our customer service functions primarily at our Eden Prairie, Minnesota and Bowling Green, Kentucky facilities, as well as with our own home-based phone agents.
Our standard return policy allows a 30-day refund period from the date of customer receipt for all customer purchases. Our return rate averaged 19% in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 and 20% in fiscal 2015. We continue to monitor our return rates in an effort to keep our overall return rates in line and commensurate with our current product sales mix and our average selling price levels. 
G. Competition 
The digital commerce retail business is highly competitive and we are in direct competition with numerous retailers, including online retailers, many of whom are larger, better financed and have a broader customer base than we do. In our television shopping and digital commerce operations, we compete for customers with other television shopping and e-commerce retailers, infomercial companies, other types of consumer retail businesses, including traditional "brick and mortar" department stores, discount stores, warehouse stores and specialty stores; catalog and mail order retailers and other direct sellers.
 Our direct competitors within the television shopping industry include QVC, Inc. and HSN, Inc. QVC, Inc. is owned by Liberty Interactive Corporation (to be renamed Qurate Retail Group, Inc.), which recently completed the purchase of the remaining 62% of HSN, Inc. to increase its holdings in HSN, Inc. to 100%. Both QVC, Inc. and HSN, Inc. are substantially larger than we are in terms of annual revenues and customers, and the programming of each is carried more broadly to U.S. households, including high definition bands and multi-channel carriage, than our programming. Multimedia Commerce Group, Inc., which operates Jewelry Television, also competes with us for customers in the jewelry category. In addition, there are a number of smaller niche retailers and startups in the television shopping arena who compete with us. We believe that our major competitors incur cable and satellite distribution fees representing a significantly lower percentage of their sales attributable to their television programming than we do, and that their fee arrangements are substantially on a commission basis (in some cases with minimum guarantees) rather than on the predominantly fixed-cost basis that we currently have. At our current sales level, our distribution costs as a percentage of total consolidated net sales are higher than those of our competition. However, we have the ability to leverage this fixed expense with sales growth to accelerate improvement in our profitability.
We anticipate continued competition for viewers and customers, for experienced video commerce and e-commerce personnel, for distribution agreements with cable and satellite systems and for vendors and suppliers - not only from television shopping companies, but also from other companies that seek to enter the video commerce and online retail industries, including telecommunications and cable companies, television networks, and other established retailers. We believe that our ability to be successful in the video commerce industry will be dependent on a number of key factors, including continuing to expand our digital footprint to meet our customers' needs, increasing the lifetime value of our customer base by a combination of growing the number of customers who purchase products from us and maximizing the dollar value of sales and profitability per customer.

H. Federal Regulation
The cable television industry is subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC. The following does not purport to be a complete summary of all of the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, known as the Communications Act; the Cable Television Consumer Protection Act of 1992, known as the Cable Act; the Telecommunications Act of 1996, known as the Telecommunications Act; or other laws and FCC rules or policies that may affect our operations. Proposals for additional or revised regulations and requirements are pending before, are being considered by, and may in the future be considered by, Congress and federal regulatory agencies from time to time. We cannot predict the effect of any existing or proposed federal legislation, regulations or policies on our business.
Cable Television
The cable industry is regulated by the FCC under the Cable Act and FCC regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as by state or local governments with respect to certain franchising matters. The FCC regulates the terms of cable programming networks that are distributed by satellite, as ours is. Those regulations require, among other things, that programming channels be provided to all competing multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”). FCC rules also require that all video programming distributed over MVPDs include captioning for the hearing-impaired, and that all programs that were originally produced to be viewed over MVPD facilities include captions if they are subsequently distributed over the internet.
Product Marketing
We offer our customers a broad range of merchandise through television, online and mobile. The manner in which we promote and sell our merchandise, including claims and representations made in connection with these efforts, is regulated by a wide variety of federal, state and local laws, regulations, rules, policies and procedures. Some examples of these that affect the manner in which we sell and promote merchandise or otherwise operate our businesses include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | The Food and Drug Administration’s regulations regarding marketing claims that can be made about cosmetic beauty products and over-the-counter drugs, which include products for treating acne or medical products, and claims that can be made about food products and dietary supplements;


• | The Federal Trade Commission’s regulations requiring that marketing claims across all product and service categories are truthful, not misleading, and substantiated, as well as its related regulations requiring disclosures concerning the seller’s material connections with or compensation to endorsers and influencers.


• | Regulations related to product safety issues and product recalls including, but not limited to, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, the Federal Hazardous Substance Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act and regulations promulgated pursuant to these acts; and


• | Laws governing the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally-identifiable information about our customers.

These laws, regulations, rules, policies and procedures are subject to change at any time. Unfavorable changes applicable to us could decrease demand for merchandise offered by us, increase costs which we may not be able to offset, subject us to additional liabilities and/or otherwise adversely affect our businesses. 
I. Intellectual Property 
We regard our intellectual property, including trademarks, service marks, copyright patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets and proprietary technologies, as critical to our success.  We rely on intellectual property protections and on confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, vendors, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights.  We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. domain names, trademarks and service marks.  Our registered trademarks and service marks are presumed valid in the United States, as long as they are in use, their registrations are properly maintained, and they have not been found to have become generic.  Registrations of trademarks and service marks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks and service marks are in use.
J. Seasonality and Economic Sensitivity 
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation, with the highest sales activity normally occurring during our fourth fiscal quarter of the year, namely November through January. Our business is also sensitive to general economic conditions and business conditions affecting consumer spending. Additionally, our television audience (and therefore sales revenue) can be significantly 
 10

impacted by major world or domestic television-covering events which attract viewership and divert audience attention away from our programming.
K. Employees
At February 3, 2018, we had approximately 1,200 employees, the majority of whom are employed in customer service, order fulfillment and television production. Approximately 12% of our employees work part-time. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement with respect to our employees.
