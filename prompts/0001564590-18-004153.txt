ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in the areas of thrombosis, other hematologic disorders and inflammation for patients who currently have limited or no approved treatment options. We are advancing three programs, including our first medicine Bevyxxa® (betrixaban), an oral, once-daily Factor Xa, or fXa, inhibitor (anticoagulant), andexanet alfa (proposed tradename AndexXa®), a recombinant protein designed to reverse the anticoagulant effect in patients treated with an oral or injectable fXa inhibitor, and cerdulatinib, a spleen tyrosine kinase, or Syk, and Janus kinases, or JAK, inhibitor in development to treat hematologic cancers. We also have a partnered program, which is focused on developing selective Syk inhibitors for inflammatory conditions.  These compounds come from our own internal research efforts and represent important advances that address significant unmet needs.
 We are focusing our efforts on the commercialization of Bevyxxa in the United States and preparing for the potential launch of andexanet alfa pending a completion of review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, anticipated in May 2018. Additionally, we are evaluating our strategy to commercialize in Europe following a positive trend vote for andexanet alfa and a negative trend vote for betrixaban received in February 2018 from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, regarding each product candidate’s respective Marketing Authorisation Applications, or MAA. We are also continuing to advance cerdulatinib through a phase 2a clinical trial. 
 Our strategy 
 Key elements of our strategy are as follows: 
  
• | commercialize Bevyxxa and andexanet alfa, if approved, in the United States using our hospital-focused sales force;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strategically scale up our field force and increase engagement with medical, scientific and academic professionals and associations to ensure awareness of unmet need;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advance betrixaban and andexanet alfa through the European approval process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advance development of cerdulatinib for the treatment of hematologic cancers; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continue to advance our current development pipeline and expand it with multiple preclinical or clinical stage product candidates that align with our scientific expertise and experience; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continue to seek and evaluate partnerships that provide support for the further development or launch of our product candidates while retaining significant economic and commercial rights.

 Marketed Product - Bevyxxa
 Bevyxxa, approved by the FDA in June 2017, is the first and only anticoagulant for hospital and extended duration prophylaxis (35 to 42 days) of venous thromboembolism, or VTE, in adult patients hospitalized for an acute medical illness who are at risk for thromboembolic complications due to moderate or severe restricted mobility and other risk factors for VTE.  Bevyxxa represents an important advance in the field of thrombosis, as it significantly reduces the risk of VTE and VTE-related events without an increase in major bleeding. Portola has worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of betrixaban.
 We launched Bevyxxa in the United States in January 2018 when drug supply became commercially available and we are continuing physician education activities, as well as hospital and payor negotiations regarding formulary placement. We believe we are able to address the multi-billion dollar market for VTE prophylaxis in acute medically ill patients with a targeted sales and marketing to the hospitals.

We believe the compelling health economic profile of Bevyxxa will enable us to effect a change in the treatment and care paradigm from in-hospital only VTE prophylaxis to a single-drug regimen from admission to the hospital to home. Our pivotal Phase 3 APEX study demonstrated that patients treated with betrixaban experienced a reduction in VTE with no increase in major bleeding and fewer all cause stroke events.  Based on the APEX data and current cost estimates of VTE events, major bleeds and strokes, we believe that betrixaban (35 to 42 days) will be cost effective when compared to enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin. Further, each year more than 150,000 acute medically ill patients worldwide die of VTE and not from their underlying medical condition. Pulmonary embolism is the most common preventable cause of hospital death and a leading cause of increased length of hospital stay. The average annual direct medical cost of treating VTE in a hospital setting in the United States is between $7,500 and $16,500 per patient and is even greater for elderly, higher risk patients. 
Product Candidates
 Our development pipeline is summarized in the table below.
 
 
Development pipeline
Product | Description | Stage | Indication | Worldwide commercial rights 
Andexanet alfa | Antidote for Factor Xa inhibitors | Phase 3b-4 | Reversal of Factor Xa inhibitor anticoagulation | Portola (excluding Japan) 
Cerdulatinib | Oral, dual Syk andJAK inhibitor | Phase 2a | Relapsed/refractory B- and T-cell malignancies | Portola (excluding topical indications)
PRT2761 | Tropical, selective Syk inhibitor | Phase 2 | Allergic conjunctivitis | Portola / Ora 
PCSK9 inhibitor | Oral, PCSK9 inhibitor | Pre-clinical | hypercholesterolemia | Portola (excluding CNS indications) 

 
Andexanet alfa
 Andexanet alfa, an FDA-designated breakthrough therapy and orphan drug, is a universal reversal agent in development for patients anticoagulated with an oral or injectable fXa inhibitor who experience a serious uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding event, or who require urgent or emergency surgery. Currently, there is no antidote or reversal agent approved for use in reversing the anticoagulating effects of fXa inhibitors.  Leading clinicians and the FDA have recognized that the lack of an effective reversal agent represents a significant unmet clinical need.
 The use of fXA inhibitors is continuing to grow at a significant steady pace. Based on our research and relevant market data, we estimate that by 2020, fXa inhibitors will have a majority share of the market in each major anti-coagulation indication. As sales of fXa inhibitors increase, the need for an effective antidote or reversal agent will increase correspondingly. We estimate that by 2020, over 440,000 patients annually in the G7 countries will require an fXa reversal agent due to a major bleeding episode (approximately 300,000), emergency surgery (approximately 100,000) and traumatic injury (approximately 100,000).

Major bleeding is the most clinically relevant side effect of anticoagulant treatment across all anticoagulants and clinical settings. Clinical trial results suggest that the frequency of major bleeding associated with the administration of fXa inhibitors ranges from 1% to 4% per year, depending on the underlying medical condition and the specific fXa inhibitor. The clinical costs of a major bleeding event in fXa inhibitor treated patients are estimated to be $28,000 per patient on average and greater than $100,000 per patient for the top 20% or most severe bleeds. Based on the frequency of bleeding rates suggested by clinical trials and our projection of 23 million to 36 million patients treated annually with fXa inhibitors in the G7 countries, we believe that the annual costs to the healthcare system to treat major bleeding episodes in patients treated with an fXa inhibitor may exceed $10 billion by 2020. We believe that an effective fXa antidote represents a potentially cost-effective way to manage these healthcare system costs. 
 The current standard treatment for patients who experience major bleeding while taking a non-oral fXa inhibitor is to administer products that directly or indirectly support clotting, such as Vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, or FFP, prothrombin complex concentrates, or PCCs, protamine, and recombinant Factor VIIa, or rFVIIa; and is dependent upon the particular fXa. The treatment is dependent upon which fXa-inhibitor the patient is taking. For example, common treatments for warfarin reversal are Vitamin K, FFP and, more recently, PCCs, while low molecular weight heparin patients needing reversal are often managed with FFP or protamine. These treatments can have potentially serious side effects, including increased risk of prothrombotic effects such as ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction in some cases. 
 It is important to note that there are no approved antidotes or reversal agents for the new oral fXa inhibitors. Moreover, the reversal agents used for established anticoagulants have not been extensively studied in clinical trials of oral fXa inhibitor-treated patients, and preliminary data suggest they may not be effective in slowing or stopping major bleeding in these patients. The existing reversal agents work mostly in the early steps of the coagulation cascade prior to the involvement of fXa and simply supplement the factor deficiency caused by established anticoagulants. For the reversal agents to affect bleeding in patients taking oral fXa inhibitors, sufficiently large quantities would need to be given to overwhelm the inhibitor, an approach that we believe could lead to dangerous prothrombotic effects. 
 We resubmitted our BLA, to the FDA in August 2017, and in December 2017, the FDA instituted an extension to allow more time for a thorough review of the information provided and to work with us on labeling and post-marketing commitments.  The new action date is May 4, 2018. In February 2018, we received a positive trend vote for andexanet alfa from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, regarding our Marketing Authorisation Application, or MAA, for Europe. The CHMP also communicated requests for additional data which could delay the CHMP opinion until the fourth quarter of 2018.
 While the BLA is under review, we are building a limited supply of andexanet alfa product from our first generation manufacturing process. Simultaneously, we are building generation 2 supply product, which will be subject to a supplemental approval process for approval by the FDA, and will enable a broader commercial launch. During the third quarter of 2017, we executed a new long-term manufacturing services agreement that will significantly increase our commercial manufacturing capacity for a period of ten years following initial approval of the generation 2 manufacturing process. 
 We are continuing to enroll patients in ANNEXA-4, our Phase 3 / 4 confirmatory patient study which underwent two Data Safety and Monitoring Board reviews during 2017, and six total to date. This multi-center open-label, single-arm study is being conducted in patients receiving apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban or enoxaparin (a low molecular weight heparin) who present with certain acute major bleeds. All participants receive andexanet alfa given as a bolus dose over 30 minutes followed by a two-hour infusion. Patients receive a low or high dose depending on which fXa inhibitor they have received and the time they received it. Patients are evaluated for 30 days following andexanet alfa administration. The co-primary efficacy endpoints are the percent change in anti-Factor Xa activity at two hours and assessment of hemostasis over 12 hours following the infusion. Hemostatic efficacy is assessed by an independent endpoint adjudication committee as either excellent, good or poor/none. To date, ANNEXA-4 has enrolled more than 250 patients of the approximately 350 patients targeted for inclusion.

Cerdulatinib
 Our third product candidate, cerdulatinib, is an orally available dual kinase inhibitor that inhibits Syk and JAK enzymes that regulate important signaling pathways.  Cerdulatinib is being developed for hematologic, or blood, cancers and inflammatory disorders. We are currently conducting a Phase 2a proof-of-concept study for cerdulatinib in patients with B- and T-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, or NHL, including patients with Follicular Lymphoma, or FL, Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma, or PTCL, and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, or CLL, who have failed or relapsed on existing marketed therapies or products in development, including patients with identified mutations. Cerdulatinib has the potential for broad activity in hematologic cancers because it blocks the B-cell receptor pathway via Syk and key cytokine receptors via JAK. In addition, pre-clinical evidence suggests that Syk is also expressed in PTCL and activating mutations in JAK pathway are frequently observed in PTCL.
 Our strategy for cerdulatinib is to focus on patients that have shown limited response to other therapies or have relapsed or do not respond due to mutations. The heterogeneity and severity of B- and T-cell malignancies may warrant simultaneous targeting of multiple disease-relevant pathways. With its dual inhibition pathway, cerdulatinib may have several benefits relative to selective kinase inhibition, such as gaining control over a broader array of disease etiologies, reducing the probability of selection of alternate disease growth mechanisms, and the potential that an overall lower level suppression of multiple targets may be sufficient to modulate disease activity. 
 Other early stage product candidates
 In addition to our lead product candidates, we have other early research and development programs including an exclusive in-license agreement with SRX Cardio LLC to explore a novel approach to develop a drug in the field of hypercholesterolemia.
 Additionally, PRT2761 is currently in a phase 2 study for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis is a disease of allergen-mediated BCR and stimulation and IgE crosslinking of FcεR1 leading to basophil and mast cell degranulation. SYK is critical for BCR and FcεR1 signaling and functional responses, and therefore represents a potentially important target for therapeutic intervention. A single-center, randomized, blinded, dose-ranging phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of PRT2761 for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis is ongoing.  
 Sales and marketing 
 We intend to commercialize both Bevyxxa and andexanet alfa, pending regulatory approvals, using a hospital-based sales force in the United States, and in major markets in Europe. To achieve global commercialization, we anticipate using a variety of distribution agreements and commercial partnerships in those territories where we do not establish a sales force. We expect to target our U.S. sales and marketing efforts at the approximately 2,000 hospitals and out-patient acute care settings that would account for the large majority of the prescribing base for our product and product candidate. We believe Bevyxxa and andexanet alfa, if approved, can be successfully commercialized in the United States with a hospital-based field force that includes approximately 150 sales representatives. Additionally, we intend to develop and publish health economic models demonstrating the value of Bevyxxa and andexanet alfa to hospital administrators and third party payors. 
 Research and development 
 We invest significant effort defining and refining our research and development process and internally teaching our approach to drug development. We favor programs with early decision points, well-validated targets, predictive preclinical models and clear paths to regulatory approval, all in the context of a target product profile that can address significant unmet or underserved clinical needs. Members of our discovery, research and development team have played central roles in discovering and developing a number of promising candidates over more than 20 years. They have used unique biological insights to develop in vitro and in vivo models that speed development. We also selectively leverage outside collaborators to expand into potential additional indications. As our product candidates progress through clinical development, we have focused and will increase that focus our scientific efforts on supporting that development.

We emphasize data-driven decision making, strive to advance or terminate projects early based on clearly defined go/no go criteria, prioritize programs at all stages and allocate our capital to the most promising programs. We are actively seeking to identify attractive external opportunities. We utilize the same critical filters for investment when evaluating external programs as we do with our own, internally-derived candidates. 
 License and collaboration agreements 
 Betrixaban 
 Millennium agreements 
 In 2003, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire patent rights and intellectual property to an ADP Receptor Antagonist Program, or the ADP Program, and a Platelet Research Program from Millennium. We are obligated to pay royalties to Millennium at tiered single-digit percentages of net sales of certain ADP Program products if product sales are ever achieved. These royalty payments will continue until the expiration of the relevant patents or ten years after launch, whichever is later. 
 In 2004, we entered into an agreement to license from Millennium certain exclusive rights to research, develop and commercialize certain compounds that inhibit fXa from Millennium, including betrixaban. We refer to this arrangement as the fXa Program. The license agreement requires us to make certain license fee, milestone, royalty and sublicense sharing payments to Millennium as we develop, commercialize or sublicense betrixaban and other products from the fXa Program. The Millennium license agreement further provides for additional payments to Millennium of up to $35.0 million based on the achievement of regulatory filing and approval milestones related to the fXa Program. In addition, we are obligated to pay Millennium royalties at tiered single-digit percentages of net sales of any fXa Program products if product sales are ever achieved. This license agreement will continue in force, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the expiration of the relevant patents or ten years after the launch, whichever is later, or termination by either party pursuant to the agreement. This license agreement may be terminated by either party for the other party’s uncured material breach. In addition, we may terminate this agreement for convenience with 30 days’ advance written notice. 
 In 2005, we amended both the asset purchase agreement for the ADP Program and the license agreement for the fXa Program. In connection with these amendments, we have made aggregate cash payments to Millennium of $6.0 million and issued to Millennium equity securities with an aggregate value of $1.8 million through December 31, 2016.

Bayer and Janssen agreements 
 In 2013, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Bayer and Janssen to include subjects dosed with rivaroxaban, their jointly owned fXa inhibitor product, in one of our Phase 2 proof-of-concept studies of andexanet alfa. In February 2014, we entered into a second collaboration agreement with Bayer and Janssen to further study the safety and efficacy of andexanet alfa as a reversal agent to rivaroxaban through our ongoing Phase 3 studies. Under this Phase 3 collaboration agreement, we received an upfront payment of $10.0 million and the right to receive additional development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $15.0 million. This Phase 3 collaboration agreement will continue in force until the approval of andexanet alfa as a reversal agent for rivaroxaban by the FDA and EMA.  
 In 2016, we entered into collaboration agreements with Bayer to include rivaroxaban in the clinical studies for approval of andexanet alfa in Japan. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $5.0 million and are eligible to receive up to $10.0 million in additional milestone payments based on Japanese regulatory approval of andexanet alfa as an antidote for rivaroxaban. Bayer will provide technical support as well as fund clinical studies of andexanet alfa with rivaroxaban in Japan. Bayer received no commercial rights under this agreement.
 Daiichi Sankyo agreement 
 In 2013, we entered into an agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to include subjects dosed with edoxaban, its fXa inhibitor product, in one of our Phase 2 proof-of-concept studies of andexanet alfa. In July 2014, we entered into a second collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to perform the necessary development and regulatory activities to support a potential U.S. and EU regulatory approval of andexanet alfa as a reversal agent for edoxaban.  Under this Phase 3 collaboration agreement we received an upfront payment of $15.0 million and are eligible to receive additional development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $25.0 million. In 2016, we amended the 2014 agreement to expedite development activities in exchange for $15.0 million and a net increase in total eligible milestones of $8.0 million. This amended collaboration agreement will continue in force until the approval of andexanet alfa as a reversal agent for edoxaban by the FDA and EMA.  
 In 2016, we entered into collaboration agreements with Daiichi Sankyo to include edoxoban in the clinical studies necessary for approval of andexanet alfa in Japan. Under the terms of the agreement, we will receive an upfront payment of $5.0 million and are eligible to receive up to $10.0 million in additional milestone payments based on Japanese regulatory approval of andexanet alfa as an antidote for edoxaban. 
 Syk Selective Inhibitors 
 Astellas agreement 
 In 2005, we entered into an agreement to license certain exclusive rights to research, develop and commercialize Syk inhibitors from Astellas Pharma, Inc., or Astellas, which agreement was subsequently amended and restated in 2010. The agreement with Astellas, as amended, requires us to make certain milestone, royalty and sublicense revenue sharing payments to Astellas as we develop, commercialize or sublicense Syk inhibitors. Pursuant to our agreement with Astellas, we made cash milestone payments to Astellas of $0.5 million in 2005, $0.5 million in 2006, and $1.0 million in 2008, as we elected to continue our development of Syk inhibitors. In addition, for each Syk inhibitor product, we may be required to make up to $71.5 million in additional milestone payments to Astellas if the product is approved for multiple distinct indications in the United States, Europe and Japan and the product attains certain sales levels. If we grant a sublicense to develop and commercialize Syk inhibitors, we are required to pay Astellas 20% of any payments (excluding royalties) received under the sublicense agreement. In 2011, in connection with our receipt of the upfront payment under our agreement with Biogen Idec, we made a cash payment to Astellas of $7.2 million. In addition, we are required to pay Astellas royalties at low single-digit percentages for worldwide sales for any Syk inhibitor product made by us or our sublicensees. This agreement will continue in force, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the expiration of relevant patents or ten years after the launch, whichever is later, or termination by either party pursuant to the agreement. The agreement may be terminated by us for convenience upon 60 days’ written notice to Astellas or immediately upon written notice if all major claims of all of the patents covered by the agreement are invalidated by competent judicial or administrative authorities in the U.S. and no measure has 
 
9


been taken to appeal the invalidation. Either party may terminate the agreement upon written notice if the other party is in material breach of its obligations under the agreement for reasons within its control and responsibility and has not remedied the breach within 30 days of receiving written notice or in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation or receivership of the other party. 
 Cerdulatinib 
 Aciex agreement (Nicox)
 In 2013, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Aciex Therapeutics, Inc., or Aciex, pursuant to which we granted Aciex an exclusive license to co-develop and co-commercialize cerdulatinib and certain related compounds for nonsystemic indications, such as the treatment and prevention of ophthalmological diseases by topical administration and allergic rhinitis by intranasal administration. In 2014, this agreement was amended to release all rights for cerdulatinib to us. The collaboration is now focused on development of other related compounds for topical ophthalmic indications. Under the agreement, we will share development costs with Aciex and be entitled to receive either a share of the profits generated by any eventual products or royalty payments. We retain rights to other indications, including dermatologic disorders. 
 Ora agreement
 In 2015, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Ora pursuant to which we granted Ora an exclusive license to co-develop and co-commercialize one of our specific Syk inhibitors, PRT2761. Ora has the primary responsibility for conducting the research and development and regulatory activities under this agreement. We are obligated to provide assistance in accordance with the agreed-upon development plan, as well as participate on various committees. 
 Under the terms of this risk and cost sharing agreement, each party will incur its own share of development costs. Third-party related development costs will be shared by Ora and us at approximately 60% and 40%, respectively, until an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, and then equally thereafter. We are entitled to receive either 50% of the profits, if any, generated by future sales of the products developed under the agreement or royalty payments on such sales, should we opt out of the agreement. 
 We may opt out of the agreement any time prior to 90 days after an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. The timing of the exercise of our opt-out rights would impact future royalties we would be entitled to receive from Ora. Each party may also buy out the rights and interests in the licensed compound by paying the greater of $6.0 million or two times the actual aggregate development cost incurred by both parties on or before the date that is 90 days after an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. 
 Dermavant agreement
 In 2016, we granted an exclusive, worldwide license to Dermavant Sciences GmbH, or, Dermavant, to develop and commercialize cerdulatinib in topical formulation for all indications, excluding oncology, in exchange for a non-refundable upfront payment of $8.8 million and contingent development and regulatory milestones and commercial milestone payments based on worldwide annual net sales. Additionally, Dermavant is required to pay us royalties on worldwide net sales of all products commercialized under the agreement throughout the license term, which continues on a country-by-country basis until the later of the 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale or the expiration of the last valid patent.
 See Note 6 and Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the section of this report entitled “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for a more detailed description of the agreements and accounting assessments associated with certain of these agreements.

Competition 
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions and others. 
 Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than any that will be commercialized by us, or obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of drugs that are safer, more efficacious and/or more cost-effective than alternative therapies. 
 Betrixaban 
 In the market for VTE prophylaxis in acute medically ill patients, betrixaban will compete with enoxaparin, which is marketed as Lovenox by Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC and as a generic pharmaceutical by several manufacturers, and to a lesser extent with other low molecular weight heparins. In addition, betrixaban may face competition in the market for acute medically ill patients from other fXa inhibitors including apixaban, which is marketed by BMS and Pfizer, edoxaban, which is marketed by Daiichi Sankyo, rivaroxaban, which is marketed by Bayer and Janssen, and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, which is marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim GbmH, although none of these molecules is currently approved for use in that population. We believe, that in light of the significant opportunity in this acute medically ill population, other agents will likely be tested in a Phase 3 study. For example, in 2014, Janssen initiated a Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban compared with placebo in the prevention of symptomatic VTE events and VTE-related death post-hospital discharge in high-risk, medically ill patients. Janssen also announced in 2014 that it had initiated a Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, and pulmonary embolism due to a concurrent medical illness for up to 45 days after hospital discharge. In the future, owners of approved direct fXa or thrombin inhibitors may decide to develop them for VTE prophylaxis in the acute medically ill patient population although nothing is in development for that indication to our knowledge. In addition, they or other competitors may decide to develop new therapies for VTE prophylaxis in acute medically ill patients. 
 Andexanet alfa 
 Currently there are no therapies approved as antidotes for fXa inhibitors. However, andexanet alfa, if approved, may compete with currently approved treatments designed to enhance coagulation including FFP, PCCs, rFVIIa, Vitamin K, protamine or whole blood. In addition, several companies have conducted clinical research on compounds that are intended to reverse the effects of one or more direct fXa inhibitors and which, if developed, may be competitive with andexanet alfa. 
 Cerdulatinib 
 In the market for the treatment of FL, PTCL, and CLL, cerdulatinib, if approved, will compete with existing therapies, such as rituximab and obinutuzumab which are marketed by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd. and Genentech, Inc., idelalisib, which is marketed by Gilead, copanlisib, which is marketed by Bayer, romidepsin, which is marketed by Celgene, pralatrexate, which is marketed by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., ibrutinib, which is marketed by Janssen and Pharmacyclics, Inc., venetoclax, which is marketed by Abbvie and Genentech, Inc.; and potentially other therapies currently in development by a number of different companies. 
 
11


Syk Selective Inhibitors 
 In the market for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis, PRT02761, if approved, will compete with existing products, such as topical antihistamines, corticosteroids, and mast cell stabilizers and potentially with other products currently in development by a number of different companies. 
 Intellectual property 
 Our success will significantly depend upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our drug candidates, including composition-of-matter, dosage and formulation patents, as well as patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our novel biological discoveries and other important technology inventions and know-how. In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. For more information, please see the section of this Report entitled “Risk factors—Risks related to intellectual property.” 
 As of December 31, 2017, we owned 50 issued U.S. patents, 16 U.S. patent applications and 321 issued patents and 130 patent applications in other jurisdictions. We also co-owned 17 additional patents and patent applications. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we have licensed 200 issued patents and 32 patent applications from third parties, mostly on an exclusive basis. The patent portfolios for our leading product candidates as of December 31, 2017 are summarized below.
 Betrixaban 
 Our betrixaban patent portfolio includes 24 issued U.S. patents and three U.S. patent applications covering the composition of and methods of making and using betrixaban or its analogs, including those owned by us and those licensed from Millennium. The U.S. issued patents relating to the composition of matter of betrixaban are not due to expire before September 2020 and may be extended up to September 2025, if betrixaban receives regulatory approval and if the necessary eligibility requirements are met, pursuant to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Related international patent applications have issued or been allowed in 37 countries and are pending in a number of other countries. These international patents and patent applications, if issued, would not be due to expire before September 2020. 
 In the United States, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years for one patent related to an approved therapy. The length of the extension is based upon the period of time the therapy has been under regulatory review. We believe that we are eligible for a full five year patent term extension for one patent relating to betrixaban. 
 In addition, we have planned a pediatric study of betrixaban in the United States as the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act provides that the period of patent exclusivity for a drug may be extended for six months if the owner of the drug conducts studies of the drug in children pursuant to a request from the FDA. 
 Andexanet alfa

Several international patent applications are still pending and if issued would not be due to expire before 2035.
 Manufacturing 
 We rely on contract manufacturing organizations produce our drugs and drug candidates in accordance with the FDA’s and EMA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. The manufacture of pharmaceuticals is subject to extensive cGMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. Our relationships with contract manufacturing organizations are managed by internal personnel with extensive experience in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing. 
Betrixaban
 Betrixaban is manufactured using common chemical engineering and synthetic processes from readily available raw materials. We have relied on Hovione, Limited, or Hovione, to produce active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for betrixaban for our APEX study, and in April 2016 we entered into an agreement with Hovione to manufacture API for betrixaban at commercial scale. Since the date of our approval we have initiated and received approval from the FDA for multiple prior approval supplements that enabled the commercial release of Bevyxxa manufactured before and after our approval date. The prior approval supplements have also enabled us to access multiple locations within Hovione’s manufacturing network, thus mitigating the single source supply risk.

Andexanet alfa
 Andexanet alfa is a recombinant biologic molecule produced in living cells, a process that is inherently complex and requires specialized knowledge and extensive process optimization and product characterization to transform laboratory scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes.
 Our current Phase 4 ANNEXA study is using clinical material with bulk drug substance manufactured by AGC Biologics, formerly CMC ICOS Biologics, Inc., and Lonza. Our BLA contemplates the manufacturing process in place at AGC Biologics. The Lonza, or generation 2, process will be subject to a supplemental approval by the regulatory authority before commercialization. During the third quarter of 2017, we executed a new long-term manufacturing services agreement with Lonza that will significantly increase our commercial manufacturing capacity for a period of ten years following initial approval of the generation 2 manufacturing process. 
 See Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the section of this report entitled “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and refer to the “Off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations” portion of this report in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a more detailed description of the agreements, obligations and accounting assessments. 
 Government regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. 
 The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | nonclinical laboratory and animal testing of the product including some that must be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug candidate for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with cGMP, and Good Clinical Practices or GCPs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval of an NDA, for a drug or a BLA, for a biologic prior to commercial marketing for specific indications for use.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
14


The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns about the supporting safety data or questions about the design of the clinical trial and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial commences at that center. Regulatory authorities or an institutional review board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include an Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. The IDMC may halt a trial if it feels that the data demonstrate efficacy of the drug and it is no longer ethical to withhold the drug from patients in the control arm of the study.
 For purposes of NDA or BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 
  
• | Phase 1 – Studies are initially conducted to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy volunteers or patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 – Studies are conducted with groups of patients with a specified disease or condition to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 – Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product compared to placebo or current standard of care and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may be done globally to support global registrations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information gathered in routine medical practice.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must also develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to establish an appropriate shelf life for the product candidate including data demonstrating that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 
15


NDA or BLA submission and review by the FDA 
 The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA. The submission of an NDA or BLA requires payment of a substantial User Fee to FDA. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide independent expert clinical opinion on application review questions. The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure consistent batch to batch purity, identity, potency, and strength of the product candidate. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes, equipment and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements. Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing (60 days post receipt of the application by the FDA, if at all), the FDA typically takes ten months to review the application and respond to the applicant, which can take the form of either a Complete Response Letter or Approval. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. FDA approval of any NDA or BLA submitted by us will be at a time the FDA chooses. Also, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed and require post-marketing requirements such as a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Procedure or a Phase 4 study. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For a fast track product, the FDA may consider review of completed sections of an NDA or BLA on a rolling basis provided the sponsor provides, and the FDA accepts, a schedule for the submission of the completed sections of the NDA or BLA. Under these circumstances, the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA. A fast track designated drug candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA reviews the NDA or BLA in a total of six months rather than ten months after it is accepted for filing. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences. Drug and biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the NDA or BLA. 
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use.

Healthcare and reimbursement regulation 
 Our sales, promotion, medical education and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs must comply with the anti-kickback provisions of the Social Security Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the False Claims Act, the Veterans Health Care Act and similar state laws. 
 Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet these applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. 
 Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. We anticipate third-party payors will provide reimbursement for our products. However, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacological studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
 Foreign regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.

European Union, or EU, member states require both regulatory clearances by the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical trial. Under the EU regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes and products designated as orphan medicinal products and optional for those products which are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients. The decentralized procedure of approval provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the reference member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials (draft summary of product characteristics, draft labeling and package leaflet) to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The sponsor responds to any inquiries and the final report is issued on the 120th day from submission of application. The final report is forwarded to the EMA for review and approval. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
