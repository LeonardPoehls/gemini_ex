Storage and delivery
 
The product produced by Wike Corp. does not require any storage facilities, as it will be produced directly for each order. We are going to sign a contract with delivering companies such as FedEx Italy, DHL Italy, Pelican Express Courier Italy on regular basis in the event of finding regular customers. Our machines will be located at our leased premise Via Lodovico Berti, 40131, Bologna, Italy and produced ribbons will be shipped to other Italian cities from there, in case if our business grow. 
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
We plan to contact event companies who can order our products of ornamental ribbons. As well as we will cooperate with the flower-shops and companies for the production of decorations to supply to them our products. As of today, we have three sales contracts with Dragonfly Ltd., Serena Dolce - Weddings & Events and Italian Event LTD. Our competitive advantage is that we offer a high quality product, while maintaining reasonable prices.
 
Initially, our sole officer and director, Corina Safaler will market our products. If we sell at least 75% shares in this offering, we intend to hire one salesperson for a half working with good knowledge and connections in the production of ornamental ribbons and printing distribution area to introduce our product also in the event of all shares are sold from this offering we are going to hire assistant, with terms of work half a day, for our sole officer and director Corina Safaler for operating of two printing machine in addition to sales person. The salesperson’s job would be to find new potential purchasers, and to set up agreements with them to buy our products. We intend to focus on direct marketing efforts whereby our representative will directly contact:
 
* Distributors who are responsible for marketing and selling our production of ornamental ribbons;
 * Flowers companies;
 * Event companies; 
 * Related to the printing industry enterprises.
 
Competition
 
The level of competition in business of printed ribbons production is high. Many of our established competitors have developed a brand following which would make our potential customers prefer their products to ours. Aggressive lower pricing tactics implemented by our competitors would make it difficult for us to enter the market. Economies of scale would make it easier for our larger established competitors to negotiate price discounts with their suppliers of products for production of ornamental ribbons, which would leave us at a disadvantage. The principal competitive factors in our industry are pricing and quality of goods. We will be in a market where we compete with many domestic and international companies offering similar products. We will be in direct competition with them. Many large companies will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential customers. Many of these companies may have a greater, more established customer base than us. We will likely lose business to such companies. Also, many of these companies will be able to afford to offer better price for similar product than us that may also cause us to lose business. We foresee to continue to face challenges from new market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Insurance
 
We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.
Employees
 
We are a development stage company and currently have no employees, other than our sole officer and director, Corina Safaler. Our business office is located at Via Arno, 8, 40139 Bologna, Italy. 
Offices
 
The phone number is 003907341980011. We have entered into a lease with Mauricio Polito. The office space is 30 square meters and located at Via Lodovico Berti, 40131, Bologna, Italy.

Government Regulation
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to export and import of products for production of ornamental ribbons and operation of any facility in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business. We do not need to receive any government approvals necessary to conduct our business; however we will have to comply with all applicable export and import regulations.
