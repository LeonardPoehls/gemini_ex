ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 6, 2001 under the name Talon Ventures, Inc. 
 On January 15, 2003, we changed our name to Alton Ventures, Inc. On October 20, 2006, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Arkanova Acquisition Corp., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Arkanova Energy, Inc., a private Delaware corporation. The agreement and plan of merger contemplated the merger of Arkanova Energy, Inc. with and into Arkanova Acquisition Corp., with Arkanova Acquisition Corp. surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary. Effective November 1, 2006, we changed our name from Alton Ventures Inc. to Arkanova Energy Corporation. The closing of the agreement and plan of merger occurred on March 1, 2007. As of that date, we acquired all of the property interests formerly held by Arkanova Energy, Inc. 
 We are a junior producing oil and gas company and are also engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of prospective oil and gas properties. We hold mineral leases in leasehold interests located in Pondera and Glacier Counties, Montana. Please see the information under the heading Item 2. Properties of this annual report for a detailed description of our property interests, including disclosure of our oil and gas operations with respect to our Montana property. 
 Management believes that future growth of our company will primarily occur through the exploration and development of our existing properties. However, we may elect to proceed through collaborative agreements and joint ventures in order to share expertise and reduce operating costs with other experts in the oil and gas industry. 
 Competition
We are a junior producing oil and gas company and are also engaged in the acquisition of prospective oil and gas properties for exploration and development. We compete with other junior producing companies in addition to significantly larger companies. As we are also engaged in the exploration and development of prospective properties, we also compete with companies for the identification of such properties and the financing necessary to develop such properties. 
 We conduct our business in an environment that is highly competitive and unpredictable. In seeking out prospective properties, we have encountered intense competition in all aspects of our business as we compete directly with other development stage companies as well as established international producing companies. Many of our competitors are national or international companies with far greater resources, capital and access to information than us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on the acquisition of prospective properties and on the exploration and development of such properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the exploration and exploitation of mineral and oil and gas properties. This competition could result in our competitors having resource properties of greater quality and attracting prospective investors to finance the development of such properties on more favorable terms. As a result of this competition, we may become involved in an acquisition with more risk or obtain financing on less favorable terms.

 Customers
There are no contracts obligating our company to provide a fixed quantity of oil and gas to any party. We have a contract with CHS Inc., that provides for their taking all of our oil and/or condensate production from the Unit (as defined below under Item 2. Properties) unless either party gives 30 days advance written notice to terminate the agreement. In the event our contact with CHS Inc. is terminated for any reason, our company has determined that there are numerous other purchasers available to enter into a similar arrangement without a material adverse effect on our company. 
 Government Regulation
The exploration and development of oil and gas properties is subject to various United States federal, state and local governmental regulations. Our company may, from time to time, be required to obtain licenses and permits from various governmental authorities in regards to the exploration of our property interests. 
 We are a company that started to produce oil and gas during the year ended September 30, 2008 and we are subject to a high level of governmental regulation. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling and abandonment bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas. The production, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of oil and gas, by-products thereof, and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and gas operations are also subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating primarily to the protection of human health and the environment. Additionally, we incur expenditures related to compliance with such laws, and may incur costs in connection with the remediation of any environmental contamination. The requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. 
 In the spring of 2014, the US Environmental Protection Agency issued an injection well permit to Provident Energy Of Montana, LLC, Arkanovas 100% owned subsidiary, for the purpose of water injection into the MAX 1 well # 2817. The permit allowed our company to commence the re-activation of waterflood operations on our companys Montana lease acreage, The Two Medicine Cut Bank Sand Unit. Waterflood operations have started in October 2014 and are continuing as of the date of this report with the addition of 6 water injection wells. 
 Environmental Liabilities
Our business is governed by numerous laws and regulations at various levels of government. These laws and regulations govern the operation and maintenance of our facilities, the discharge of materials into the environment and other environmental protection issues. Such laws and regulations may, among other potential consequences, require that we acquire permits before commencing drilling and restrict the substances that can be released into the environment with drilling and production activities. Under these laws and regulations, we could be liable for personal injury, clean-up costs and other environmental and property damages, as well as administrative, civil and criminal penalties. 
 Employees
Our company is currently operated by Pierre Mulacek as our president and chief executive officer and Reginald Denny as our chief financial officer. As of the date of this report, we had 7 employees including Pierre Mulacek and Reginald Denny. We intend to periodically hire independent contractors to execute our exploration and development activities. Our company may hire employees when circumstances warrant. At present, however, our company does not anticipate hiring any additional employees in the near future.
