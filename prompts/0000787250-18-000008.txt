Item 1 – Business

OVERVIEW
DPL is a regional energy company incorporated in 1985 under the laws of Ohio. All of DPL’s stock is owned by an AES subsidiary.
DP&L is a public utility incorporated in 1911 under the laws of Ohio. Beginning in 2001, Ohio law gave consumers the right to choose the electric generation supplier from whom they purchase retail generation service, however transmission and distribution services are still regulated. DP&L has the exclusive right to provide such service to its approximately 521,000 customers located in West Central Ohio. DP&L is required to procure and provide retail SSO electric service to residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers in a 6,000 square mile area of West Central Ohio. Since January 2016, DP&L has been sourcing 100% of the generation for its SSO customers through a competitive bid process. Through September 30, 2017, DP&L owned undivided interests in five coal-fired power stations and multiple peaking electric generating facilities as well as numerous transmission facilities. On October 1, 2017, the DP&L-owned generating facilities were transferred to AES Ohio Generation, an affiliate of DP&L and wholly-owned subsidiary of DPL, through an asset contribution agreement to a subsidiary that was merged into AES Ohio Generation. Also, Stuart Station Unit 1 was retired on October 1, 2017. Principal industries located in DP&L’s service territory include automotive, food processing, paper, plastic, manufacturing and defense. DP&L's sales reflect the general economic conditions, seasonal weather patterns of the area and the market price of electricity. Through the date of Generation Separation, DP&L sold energy and capacity into the wholesale market.
DPL’s other significant subsidiaries include AES Ohio Generation, which owns and operates coal-fired and peaking generating facilities from which it makes wholesale sales of electricity, and MVIC, our captive insurance company that provides insurance services to us and our other subsidiaries. DPL wholly owns each of its subsidiaries.
On December 8, 2017, AES Ohio Generation completed the sale of the Miami Fort and Zimmer stations to subsidiaries of Dynegy in accordance with an asset purchase agreement dated April 21, 2017. In addition, on December 15, 2017, AES Ohio Generation entered into an asset purchase agreement for the sale of its Peaker assets to Kimura Power, LLC.
DPL also has a wholly-owned business trust, DPL Capital Trust II, formed for the purpose of issuing trust capital securities to investors.
DP&L does not have any subsidiaries.
DP&L’s electric transmission and distribution businesses are subject to rate regulation by federal and state regulators. Accordingly, DP&L applies the accounting standards for regulated operations to its electric transmission and distribution businesses and records regulatory assets when incurred costs are expected to be recovered in future customer rates, and regulatory liabilities when current cost recoveries in customer rates relate to expected future costs.
SEGMENTS
DPL manages its business through two reportable operating segments, the Transmission and Distribution segment and the Generation segment. See Note 14 – Business Segments of the Notes to DPL’s Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding DPL’s reportable segments.
10

With the transfer of its generation assets on October 1, 2017, DP&L has only one reportable operating segment, the Transmission and Distribution segment.
EMPLOYEES
DPL and its subsidiaries employed 1,060 people at January 31, 2018, of which 660 were employed by DP&L. Approximately 60% of all DPL employees are under a collective bargaining agreement. The current agreement, after initially being extended, expired on January 31, 2018. Under national labor law, all the terms and conditions of the expired agreement continue indefinitely, with a few exceptions. Notably, the union has the right to strike and DP&L and AES Ohio Generation each have the right to lock out employees. We are continuing to negotiate with the union to enter into a new collective bargaining agreement. Currently, we are unable to predict the eventual outcome of these negotiations and have contingency plans to continue our operations. If we are not able to reach an agreement on terms favorable to us or to effectively implement our plans in the event that agreement is not reached, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted.
SERVICE COMPANY
The Service Company provides services including accounting, legal, human resources, information technology and other services of a similar nature on behalf of companies that are part of the U.S. SBU, including, among other companies, DPL and DP&L. The Service Company allocates the costs for these services based on cost drivers designed to result in fair and equitable allocations. This includes ensuring that the regulated businesses served, including DP&L, are not subsidizing costs incurred for the benefit of other businesses.
ELECTRIC OPERATIONS AND FUEL SUPPLY
2017 Summer Generating Capacity
(in MW)
DPL's present summer generating capacity is as follows:

Summer Generating Capacity | Coal fired(steam generation)(percent of total) | Combustion Turbines, Diesel Units and Solar(percent of total) | | Total
DPL | 1,137 | | 54% | | 988 | 46% | 2,125

100% of DPL’s existing steam generating capacity is provided by generating units owned as tenants in common with Dynegy, Inc. and/or AEP Generation. As tenants in common, each company owns a specified share of each of these units, is entitled to its share of capacity and energy output and has a capital and operating cost responsibility proportionate to its ownership share. Additionally, DP&L, Duke Energy and Ohio Power Company own, as tenants in common, 880 circuit miles of 345,000-volt transmission lines. DP&L has several interconnections with other companies for the purchase, sale and interchange of electricity.
In 2017, DPL generated 95% of its electric output from coal-fired units and 5% from solar, oil and natural gas-fired units.
11

The following table sets forth DPL’s generating stations and, where indicated, those stations which are owned as tenants in common:

(4) | DPL announced during 2017 that it plans on retiring the co-owned Stuart Station coal-fired and diesel-fired generating units and the co-owned Killen Station coal-fired generating unit and combustion turbine on or before June 1, 2018


(5) | On December 15, 2017, AES Ohio Generation entered into an asset purchase agreement for the sale of these generating facilities. See Note 17 – Assets and Liabilities Held-For-Sale and Dispositions of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements. 

DP&L also owns a 4.9% equity ownership interest in OVEC, an electric generating company. OVEC has two electric generating stations located in Cheshire, Ohio and Madison, Indiana with a combined generation capacity of 2,109 MW. DP&L’s share of this generation capacity is 103 MW.
We have all of the coal volume needed to meet our wholesale sales obligations for 2018 under contract. The majority of the contracted coal is purchased at fixed prices. Some contracts provide for periodic adjustments and some are priced based on market indices. Fuel costs are affected by changes in volume and price and are driven by a number of variables including weather, the wholesale market price of power, certain provisions in coal contracts related to government-imposed costs, counterparty performance and credit, scheduled/forced outages and generation station mix. Due to the installation of emission control equipment at certain commonly-owned units and barring any changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate, we expect to have balanced positions for SO2, NOx and renewable energy credits for 2018.
The gross average cost of fuel consumed per kWh was $2.09 per kWh, $2.30 per kWh and $2.48 per kWh in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
SEASONALITY
The power generation and delivery businesses are seasonal and weather patterns have a material effect on operating performance. In the region we serve, demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and in the winter months associated with heating compared to other times of the year. Unusually mild summers and winters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
12

MARKET STRUCTURE
Retail rate regulation
DP&L's delivery service to all retail customers as well as the provisions of its SSO service are regulated by the PUCO. In addition, certain costs are considered to be non-bypassable and are therefore assessed to all DP&L retail customers, under the regulatory authority of the PUCO, regardless of the customer’s retail electric supplier. DP&L's transmission rates and AES Ohio Generation's wholesale electric rates are subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act.
Ohio law establishes the process for determining SSO and non-bypassable rates charged by public utilities. Regulation of retail rates encompasses the timing of applications, the effective date of rate changes, the cost basis upon which the rates are set and other service-related matters. Ohio law also established the Office of the OCC, which has the authority to represent residential consumers in state and federal judicial and administrative rate proceedings.
Ohio legislation extends the jurisdiction of the PUCO to the records and accounts of certain public utility holding company systems, including DPL. The legislation extends the PUCO's supervisory powers to a holding company system's general condition and capitalization, among other matters, to the extent that such matters relate to the costs associated with the provision of public utility service. Based on existing PUCO and FERC authorization, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded on the balance sheets of both DPL and DP&L. See Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL’s Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DP&L’s Financial Statements.
COMPETITION AND REGULATION
Ohio Matters
Ohio Retail Rates
DP&L filed a settlement in its 2017 ESP case in January 2017 and filed an amended stipulation on March 13, 2017. The PUCO issued a final decision on October 20, 2017, modifying and adopting the amended stipulation and recommendation. The 2017 ESP establishes DP&L's framework for providing retail service on a going forward basis including rate structures, non-bypassable charges and other specific rate recovery true-up rider mechanisms. The signatory parties agreed to a six-year settlement that provides a framework for energy rates and defines other components.
For more information regarding DP&L's ESP, see Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL’s Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DP&L’s Financial Statements.
The costs associated with providing high voltage transmission service and wholesale electric sales and ancillary services are subject to FERC jurisdiction. While DPL has market-based rate authority for wholesale electric sales, DPL would be required to file an application at FERC under section 101 of Title 18 of the Code of Federal Regulations to change any of its cost-based transmission or ancillary service rates.
On November 30, 2015, DP&L filed a distribution rate case with the PUCO using a 12-month test year of June 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016 to measure revenue and expenses and a date certain of September 30, 2015 to measure its asset base. DP&L is seeking an increase to distribution revenues of $65.8 million per year. DP&L has asked for recovery of certain regulatory assets. DP&L has proposed a modified straight-fixed variable rate design in an effort to decouple distribution revenues from electric sales. If approved as filed, the rates are expected to have an increase of approximately 4% on a typical residential customer bill based on rates in effect at the time of the filing.
Ohio law and the PUCO rules contain targets relating to renewable energy, peak demand reduction and energy efficiency standards. If any targets are not met, compliance penalties will apply unless the PUCO makes certain findings that would excuse performance. DP&L is in full compliance with energy efficiency, peak demand reduction and renewable energy targets. DP&L is required to file an energy efficiency portfolio plan to demonstrate how it plans to meet the standards. On June 15, 2017, DP&L filed an energy efficiency portfolio plan for programs in years 2018 through 2020, which was settled and approved by the Commission on December 20, 2017. For additional information on this settlement agreement, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition - Key Trends and Uncertainties - Regulatory Environment". DP&L recovers the costs of its compliance 
13

with Ohio energy efficiency and renewable energy standards through separate riders which are reviewed and audited by the PUCO.
As a member of PJM, DP&L receives revenues from the RTO related to DP&L’s transmission assets and incurs costs associated with its load obligations for retail customers. Ohio law includes a provision that would allow Ohio electric utilities to seek and obtain a reconcilable rider to recover RTO-related costs and credits. DP&L continues to recover non-market-based transmission and ancillary costs through its transmission rider.
DP&L and AES Ohio Generation filed an application before the FERC to adjust their rates with respect to reactive power provided to PJM from their generation units. On March 3, 2017, DP&L, AES Ohio Generation, and certain intervening parties filed an Offer of Settlement that was approved by the FERC on May 16, 2017. The changes from current reactive power rates were not material. Additionally, the FERC has referred to the FERC’s Office of Enforcement for investigation, an issue regarding reactive power charges under the previously effective rates in light of changes in DP&L’s generation portfolio. Prior to 2017, DP&L's reactive power rates had been last reset in 1998. As of the date of this report, DP&L is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the investigation. Several other utilities within PJM are also being investigated by FERC’s Office of Enforcement on the same issue of changes in the generation portfolio that occurred in between rate proceedings. In connection with transactions and other matters discussed above, there have been subsequent reactive power filings made, including filings to reflect: the transfer of generation from DP&L to AES Ohio Generation; the retirement of Stuart Unit 1; the sale of interests in the Miami Fort and Zimmer stations to subsidiaries of Dynegy; and a future adjustment that would be effective upon closing of the planned sale of the Peaker assets to Kimura Power, LLC.
DP&L is subject to a SEET threshold and is required to apply general rules for calculating earnings and comparing them to a comparable group to determine whether there were significantly excessive earnings during a given calendar year. In future years, the SEET could have a material effect on results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See Note 3 – Regulatory Matters for more information.
Ohio Competition
Since January 2001, DP&L’s electric customers have been permitted to choose their retail electric generation supplier. DP&L continues to have the exclusive right to provide delivery service in its state-certified territory and the obligation to procure and provide electricity to SSO customers that do not choose an alternative supplier. The PUCO maintains jurisdiction over DP&L’s delivery of electricity, SSO and other retail electric services.
Competitive Generation
Like other electric utilities and energy marketers, AES Ohio Generation may sell or purchase electric products in the wholesale market. AES Ohio Generation competes with other generators, power marketers, privately and municipally-owned electric utilities and rural electric cooperatives when selling electricity. The ability of AES Ohio Generation to sell this electricity will depend not only on the performance of our generating units, but also on how AES Ohio Generation’s prices, terms and conditions compare to those of other suppliers.
As part of Ohio’s electric deregulation law, all of the state’s investor-owned utilities were required to join an RTO. DP&L is a member of the PJM RTO. The role of the RTO is to administer a competitive wholesale market for electricity and ensure reliability of the transmission grid. PJM ensures the reliability of the high-voltage electric power system serving more than 50 million people in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. PJM coordinates and directs the operation of the region’s transmission grid, administers the world’s largest competitive wholesale electricity market and plans regional transmission expansion improvements to maintain grid reliability and relieve congestion.
Capacity Auction Price
The PJM capacity base residual auction for the 2020/21 period cleared at a price of $77/MW-day for our RTO area. The prices for the periods 2019/20, 2018/19, 2017/18, and 2016/17 were $100/MW-day, $165/MW-day, $152/MW-day and $134/MW-day, respectively, based on previous auctions. As discussed below, a new CP program was approved by the FERC, which has phased in and replaced the RPM as of the 2018/19 auction. During the phase-in period, the RPM auction results were modified based on transitional auctions that were conducted in the third quarter of 2015. These estimates are discussed further within Commodity Pricing Risk in the Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative disclosures about Market Risk.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
DPL’s and DP&L's facilities and operations are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local environmental regulations and laws. The environmental issues that may affect us include:

• | The federal CAA and state laws and regulations (including SIPs) which require compliance, obtaining permits and reporting as to air emissions;


• | Litigation with federal and certain state governments and certain special interest groups regarding whether modifications to or maintenance of certain coal-fired generating stations require additional permitting or pollution control technology, or whether emissions from coal-fired generating stations cause or contribute to global climate changes;


• | Rules and future rules issued by the USEPA, the Ohio EPA or other authorities that require or will require substantial reductions in SO2, particulates, mercury, acid gases, NOx, and other air emissions. DPL installed emission control technology and is taking other measures to comply with required and anticipated reductions. As AES Ohio Generation is now operating these facilities, it is continuing to comply with these requirements; 


• | Rules and future rules issued by the USEPA, the Ohio EPA or other authorities that require or will require reporting and reductions of GHGs;


• | Rules and future rules issued by the USEPA, the Ohio EPA or other authorities associated with the federal Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States except pursuant to appropriate permits; and


• | Solid and hazardous waste laws and regulations, which govern the management and disposal of certain waste.

In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. In the normal course of business, we have investigatory and remedial activities underway at our facilities to comply, or to determine compliance, with such regulations. We record liabilities for loss contingencies related to environmental matters when a loss is probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with the provisions of GAAP. Accordingly, we have immaterial accruals for loss contingencies for environmental matters. We also have a number of environmental matters for which we have not accrued loss contingencies because the risk of loss is not probable, or a loss cannot be reasonably estimated. We evaluate the potential liability related to environmental matters quarterly and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. See Note 12 – Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Contingencies – "Environmental Matters” of Notes to DPL’s Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 11 – Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Contingencies – "Environmental Matters" of Notes to DP&L’s Financial Statements for more information regarding environmental risks, laws and regulations and legal proceedings to which we are and may be subject to in the future.
In response to Executive Orders from the U.S. President, the USEPA is currently evaluating various existing regulations to be considered for repeal, replacement, or modification. We cannot predict at this time the likely outcome of the USEPA’s review of these or other existing regulations or what impact it may have on our business.
We have several pending environmental matters associated with our coal-fired generation units. Some of these matters could have material adverse impacts on the operation of the power stations.
Environmental Matters Related to Air Quality
Clean Air Act Compliance
In 1990, the federal government amended the CAA to further regulate air pollution. Under the CAA, the USEPA sets limits on how much of a pollutant can be in the ambient air anywhere in the United States. The CAA allows individual states to have stronger pollution controls than those set under the CAA, but states are not allowed to have weaker pollution controls than those set for the whole country. The CAA has a material effect on our operations and such effects are detailed below with respect to certain programs under the CAA.
Cross-State Air Pollution Rule
On September 7, 2016, the USEPA finalized an update to the CSAPR to address the 2008 ozone NAAQS. CSAPR addresses the "good neighbor" provision of the CAA, which prohibits sources within each state from 
15

emitting any air pollutant in an amount which will contribute significantly to any other state’s non-attainment, or interference with maintenance of, any NAAQS. The final rule found that NOx ozone season emissions in 22 states (including Ohio) affect the ability of downwind states to attain and maintain the 2008 ozone NAAQS. For these 22 states, the USEPA issued federal implementation plans that generally update existing CSAPR NOx ozone season emission budgets for electric generating units within these states and implement these budgets through modifications to the existing CSAPR NOx ozone season allowance trading program. Implementation began in the 2017 ozone season (May through September 2017). Affected facilities receive fewer ozone season NOx allowances in 2017 and later, possibly resulting in the need to purchase additional allowances. As a result of DPL’s decision to retire its Stuart and Killen generating stations, the sale of the Miami Fort and Zimmer generating stations and the agreement to sell its Peaker assets, we do not expect any impact on our remaining generating assets to be material.
Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants
On May 3, 2011, the USEPA published proposed Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for coal- and oil-fired EGUs. The standards include new requirements for emissions of mercury and a number of other heavy metals. The USEPA Administrator signed the final rule, now called MATS, on December 16, 2011, and the rule was published in the Federal Register on February 16, 2012, with a compliance date of April 16, 2015. All of our operating EGUs are currently achieving compliance through control technologies in place.
On January 31, 2013, the USEPA finalized a rule regulating emissions of toxic air pollutants from new and existing industrial, commercial and institutional boilers and process heaters at major and area source facilities. This regulation affects five auxiliary boilers used for start-up purposes at DPL’s generation facilities. The regulation contains emissions limitations, operating limitations and other requirements. As of the date of this report, DPL is in material compliance with this rule.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards
On January 25, 2013, the USEPA published the 2012 PM 2.5 standard of 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter. On January 15, 2015, the USEPA published its final designations for the 2012 standard. No counties containing generating facilities owned or operated by DPL have been designated as non-attainment.
On October 1, 2015, the USEPA released a final rule lowering the 8-hour ozone standard from 0.075 to 0.070 ppm. The USEPA published its final ozone attainment designations on November 16, 2017, designating all counties in Ohio as attainment/unclassifiable. No generating facilities currently owned or operated by DPL are in non-attainment areas. In December 2013, eight northeastern states petitioned the USEPA to add nine upwind states, including Ohio, to the Ozone Transport Region, a group of states required to impose enhanced restrictions on NOx emissions. On November 3, 2017, the USEPA published a final rule denying the petition. On December 26, 2017, eight northeastern states filed a petition for review challenging the final rule denying the petition. In addition, Maryland petitioned the USEPA in November 2016, asking the USEPA to determine that 36 electric generating units emit pollutants that contribute to non-attainment of the ozone standards in their state. The Killen unit was on the list of 36 units. On September 27, 2017, the State of Maryland filed a complaint against the USEPA for failing to address its November 2016 CAA petition. In light of the scheduled retirement of the Killen unit, even if this petition is granted, we do not expect any additional requirements to have a material impact on us.
Effective April 12, 2010, the USEPA implemented revisions to its primary NAAQS for nitrogen dioxide. Additionally, on August 23, 2010, the USEPA implemented its revisions to its primary NAAQS for SO2 replacing the previous 24-hour standard and annual standard with a one-hour standard. As a result of DPL’s decision to retire its Stuart and Killen generating stations, the sale of the Miami Fort and Zimmer generating stations and the agreement to sell its Peaker assets, we do not expect any impact on our remaining generation assets to be material.
On May 5, 2004, the USEPA issued its proposed regional haze rule, which addresses how states should determine the Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) for sources covered under the regional haze rule. Final rules were published July 6, 2005, providing states with several options for determining whether sources in the state should be subject to BART. In January 2017, the USEPA revised the rules governing submission of SIPs to implement the visibility programs, postponing the due date for the next SIP revisions until July 2021. We cannot determine the extent of the impact, if any, on our remaining operations until Ohio determines how BART will be implemented.
16

Carbon Dioxide and Other Greenhouse Gas Emissions
On December 22, 2015, the USEPA's final CO2 emission rules for existing power plants, the CPP became effective. The CPP provides for interim emissions performance rates that must be achieved beginning in 2022 and final emissions performance rates that must be achieved starting in 2030. Under the CPP, states are required to meet state-wide emission rate standards or equivalent mass-based standards, with the goal being a 32% reduction in total U.S. power sector emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The CPP would require states to submit, by 2016, implementation plans to meet the standards or a request for an extension to 2018. If a state fails to develop and submit an approvable implementation plan, the USEPA will finalize a federal plan for that state. The full impact of the CPP would depend on the following:

• | whether and how the states in which the Company's U.S. businesses operate respond to the CPP;


• | whether the states adopt an emissions trading regime and, if so, which trading regime;


• | how other states respond to the CPP, which will affect the size and robustness of any emissions trading market; and


• | how other companies may respond in the face of increased carbon costs.

Several states and industry groups challenged the NSPS for CO2 in the D.C. Circuit Court. Pursuant to a court order issued in August 2017, the litigation is being held in indefinite abeyance pending further court order.
In addition, several states and industry groups filed petitions in the D.C. Circuit Court challenging the CPP and requested a stay of the rule while the challenge was considered. The D.C. Circuit Court denied the stay and granted requests to consider the challenges on an expedited basis. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued orders staying implementation of the CPP pending resolution of challenges to the rule. On March 28, 2017, the USEPA filed a motion in the D.C. Circuit Court to hold the challenges to both the CPP and the GHG NSPS in abeyance in light of an Executive Order signed the same day. On April 28, 2017, the D.C. Circuit Court issued orders holding the challenges to both rules in abeyance for 60 days, with subsequent extensions granted by the court. The most recent extension of the CPP litigation was set to expire in January 2018 but, on January 10, 2018, the USEPA filed a status report requesting that the court continue to hold the case in abeyance pending the conclusion of further rulemaking on the CPP. On October 16, 2017, the USEPA published in the Federal Register a proposed rule that would rescind the CPP. On December 28, 2017, the USEPA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit comments as the USEPA considers a potential rule to establish emission guidelines to replace the CPP and limit GHG emissions from existing electric generating units under Section 111(d) of the CAA. Some states and environmental groups have opposed the USEPA’s most recent request to continue to hold the CPP appeals in abeyance and the D.C. Circuit Court has not yet acted upon the USEPA’s request.
Due to the future uncertainty of the CPP, we cannot at this time determine the impact on our operations or financial results, but we believe the cost to comply with the CPP, should it be upheld and implemented in its current or a substantially similar form, could be material. The GHG NSPS remains in effect at this time, and, absent further action from the USEPA that rescinds or substantively revises the NSPS, it could impact any plans to construct and/or modify or reconstruct electric generating units in some locations, which may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We will likely not know the answers to the above questions regarding the CPP until later in 2018 or potentially 2019. As the first compliance period would not end until 2025, and because we cannot predict whether the CPP will survive the legal challenges or be repealed or replaced through rulemaking, it is too soon to determine the CPP's potential impact on our business, operations or financial condition, but any such impact could be material.
During 2017, approximately 95% of the energy we produced was generated by coal. As a result of DPL’s decision to retire its Stuart and Killen generating stations, the sale of the Miami Fort and Zimmer generating stations and the agreement to sell its Peaker assets, we do not expect any impact on our remaining generating assets to be material.

Litigation, Notices of Violation and Other Matters Related to Air Quality
Litigation Involving Co-Owned Stations
As a result of a 2008 consent decree entered into with the Sierra Club and approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, DPL and the other owners of the Stuart generating station are subject to certain specified emission targets related to NOX, SO2 and particulate matter. The consent decree also includes commitments for energy efficiency and renewable energy activities. An amendment to the consent decree was entered into and approved in 2010 to clarify how emissions would be computed during startups. Continued compliance with the consent decree, as amended, is not expected to have a material effect on DPL’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in the future.
Notices of Violation Involving Co-Owned Units
In June 2000, the USEPA issued an NOV to the then DP&L-operated Stuart generating station (now co-owned by AES Ohio Generation, Dynegy and AEP Generation) for alleged violations of the CAA. The NOV contained allegations consistent with NOVs and complaints that the USEPA had brought against numerous other coal-fired utilities in the Midwest. The NOV indicated the USEPA may: (1) issue an order requiring compliance with the requirements of the Ohio SIP; or (2) bring a civil action seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day for each violation. To date, neither action has been taken. DPL cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
On March 13, 2008, Duke Energy, the operator of the Zimmer generating station, received an NOV and a Finding of Violation (FOV) from the USEPA alleging violations of the CAA, the Ohio SIP and permits for the station in areas including SO2, opacity and increased heat input. A second NOV and FOV with similar allegations was issued on November 4, 2010. Also in 2010, the USEPA issued an NOV to Duke Energy for excess emissions at the Zimmer generation station. In addition, Duke Energy received an NOV from the USEPA dated December 16, 2014 alleging violations in opacity at the Zimmer generating station on two dates in 2014. DP&L was a co-owner of the Zimmer generating station at the time and could be affected by the eventual resolution of these matters. Dynegy is expected to act on behalf of itself and its co-owners, including DPL, with respect to these matters. DPL sold its interest in the Zimmer generating station to Dynegy on December 8, 2017.
In January 2015, DP&L received NOVs from the USEPA alleging violations in opacity at the Stuart and Killen generating stations in 2014. On February 15, 2017, the USEPA issued an NOV alleging violations in opacity at the Stuart generation station in 2016. We are currently unable to predict the outcome of these matters.
Notices of Violation Involving Wholly-Owned Stations
On November 18, 2009, the USEPA issued an NOV to DP&L for alleged NSR violations of the CAA at the Hutchings Station relating to capital projects performed in 2001 involving Unit 3 and Unit 6. We do not believe that the two projects described in the NOV were modifications subject to NSR. As a result of the cessation of operations of the six coal-fired units at the Hutchings Station, we believe that the USEPA is unlikely to pursue the NSR complaint.
Environmental Matters Related to Water Quality, Waste Disposal and Ash Ponds
As a result of DPL’s decision to retire its Stuart and Killen generating stations and the sale of its ownership interest in the Miami Fort and Zimmer generating stations, the following environmental matters, regulations and requirements (described in further detail below) are not expected to have a material impact on DPL with respect to these generating stations:

• | water intake regulations finalized by the USEPA on May 19, 2014;


• | the appeal of the NPDES permit governing the discharge of water from the Stuart Station;


• | revised technology-based regulations governing water discharges from steam electric generating facilities, finalized by the USEPA on November 3, 2015; and


• | water rules for Selenium published July 13, 2016.

Clean Water Act – Regulation of Water Intake
On May 19, 2014, the USEPA finalized new regulations pursuant to the CWA governing existing facilities that have cooling water intake structures. The rules require an assessment of impingement and/or entrainment of organisms as a result of cooling water withdrawal. Although we do not yet know the full impact the final rules will have on our operations, material changes to the intake structure at the Stuart Station to reduce impingement with the possibility of additional site-specific requirements for reducing entrainment could be 
18

required. With DPL's decision to retire the Stuart generating station, we do not believe the final rules will have a material impact on operations at that station or any of the other DPL-operated facilities.
Clean Water Act – Regulation of Water Discharge
On January 7, 2013, the Ohio EPA issued a final NPDES permit to Stuart generating station which included a compliance schedule for performing a study to justify an alternate thermal limitation or take undefined measures to meet certain temperature limits. On February 1, 2013, DP&L appealed various aspects of the final permit to the Environmental Review Appeals Commission. As a result of DPL’s decision to retire the Stuart generating station we do not expect this to have a material impact on us.
On November 3, 2015, the USEPA published its final ELG rule to reduce toxic pollutants discharged into waterways by power plants. Under the provisions of the final rule, discharges from fly ash ponds and bottom ash ponds will eventually be prohibited and treatment will be required for water discharges associated with flue gas desulfurization equipment. Legal challenges to the ELG rule are pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (the “Fifth Circuit”) and are currently being held in abeyance during review of the rule and possible rulemaking. On September 18, 2017, the USEPA published a final rule in the Federal Register delaying certain compliance dates of the ELG and withdrew the stay issued by the Trump Administration on April 25, 2017. If we were required to fully implement the requirements of the rule based on current operations, we anticipate that we would be required to make significant capital expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. However, as a result of the decision to retire the Stuart and Killen generating stations, we do not expect the ELG rule to have a material impact on either of these two stations. We may have continuing obligations under the ELG rule at our Conesville EGU.
Clean Water Act rules for Selenium
On July 13, 2016, the USEPA published the final updated chronic aquatic life criterion for the pollutant selenium in freshwater per section 304(a) of the CWA. The rule will be implemented after state rulemaking occurs, and requirements will be incorporated into NPDES permits with compliance schedules in some cases. It is too early in the rulemaking process to determine the impact, if any, on our operations, financial position or results of operations.
Regulation of Waste Disposal
In 2002, DP&L and other parties received a special notice that the USEPA considered DP&L to be a PRP for the clean-up of hazardous substances at a third-party landfill known as the South Dayton Dump (“Landfill”). Several of the parties voluntarily accepted some of the responsibility for contamination at the Landfill and, in May 2010, three of those parties, Hobart Corporation, Kelsey-Hayes Company, and NCR Corporation (“PRP Group”), filed a civil complaint in Ohio federal court (the “District Court”) against DP&L and numerous other defendants, alleging that the defendants contributed to the contamination at the landfill and were liable for contribution to the PRP group for costs associated with the investigation and remediation of the site.
While DP&L was able to get the initial case dismissed, the PRP Group subsequently, in 2013, entered into an additional Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (“ASAOC”) with the USEPA relating to vapor intrusion and again filed suit against DP&L and other defendants. Trial for that issue is scheduled to be held in 2019. Plaintiffs also attempted to add an additional ASAOC they entered into in 2016 pertaining to the investigation and remediation of all hazardous substances present in the Landfill - potentially including undefined areas outside the original dump footprint - to the 2019 trial. The court allowed the claim to be added to the litigation but ruled that the 2016 ASAOC could not be adjudicated until after completion of the remedial investigation feasibility study, which is expected to be complete years after the 2019 vapor intrusion trial. While DP&L is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, if DP&L were required to contribute to the clean-up of the site, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In December 2003, DP&L and other parties received a special notice that the USEPA considers us to be a PRP for the clean-up of hazardous substances at the Tremont City landfill site. Information available to DP&L does not demonstrate that it contributed hazardous substances to the site. While DP&L is unable to predict the outcome of this matter, if DP&L were required to contribute to the clean-up of the site, it could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Regulation of Ash Ponds
The USEPA's final CCR rule became effective on October 19, 2015. Generally, the rule regulates CCR as nonhazardous solid waste and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new CCR landfills and 
19

existing and new CCR surface impoundments (ash ponds), including location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring, corrective action and closure requirements and post-closure care. In 2015, DPL increased the ARO related to ash ponds by a net $40.3 million as a result of additional information obtained in response to this rule. On September 13, 2017, the USEPA indicated that it would reconsider certain provisions of the CCR rule in response to two petitions it received to reconsider the final rule. It is too early to determine whether the CCR rule or any reconsideration of the rule may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Notice of Violation Involving Co-Owned Units
On September 9, 2011, DP&L received an NOV from the USEPA with respect to its co-owned Stuart generating station based on a compliance evaluation inspection conducted by the USEPA and the Ohio EPA in 2009. The notice alleged non-compliance by DP&L with certain provisions of the RCRA, the CWA NPDES permit program and the station’s storm water pollution prevention plan. The notice requested that DP&L respond with the actions it has subsequently taken or plans to take to remedy the USEPA’s findings and ensure that further violations will not occur. Based on its review of the findings, although there can be no assurance, we believe that the notice will not result in any material effect on DPL’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
In November 2016, Duke Energy announced a settlement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Ohio associated with an NOV issued by the USEPA for a fuel oil spill at the Beckjord station in 2014. DP&L at that time co-owned 50% of one of the units at the station and was generally responsible for that percentage of that unit’s costs. The settlement includes a $1.0 million fine and a requirement to clean up the spill at the station. DP&L's portion of the fine and cleanup costs associated with this spill, based on its prior ownership of that one unit at the station, has not yet been determined.
Capital Expenditures for Environmental Matters
DPL’s environmental capital expenditures were approximately $0.5 million, $6.1 million and $6.5 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. DPL has projected $0.6 million in environmental-related capital expenditures for 2018.
