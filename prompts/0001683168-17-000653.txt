It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2015 financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. While management believes the procedures followed in preparing these condensed financial statements are reasonable, the accuracy of the amounts are in some respects dependent upon the facts that will exist, and procedures that will be accomplished by the Company later in the year. These results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.
 
These condensed unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
 
b)    Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

f)    Advertising Costs

g)    Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to federally insured limits. At times balances may exceed FDIC insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
 
h)   Concentration of Credit Risk
 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and cash. As of December 31, 2016 the Company believes it has no significant risk related to its concentration within its accounts receivable.
 
j)    Accounts Receivable
 
Accounts receivable are non-interest bearing obligations due under normal trade terms. Senior management reviews accounts receivable on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables will be potentially uncollectible. Historical bad debts and current economic trends are used in evaluating the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company includes any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible, along with a general reserve, in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on the information available, the Company believes its allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is adequate.

l)   Income Taxes
 
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method described in FASB ASC 740. Deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources, the most significant being: a) tax losses that can be carried forward to be utilized against profits in future years; b) expenses recognized in the books but disallowed in the tax return until the associated cash flow occurs; and c) valuation changes of assets which need to be tax effected for book purposes but are deductible only when the valuation change is realized.
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefit, which is not more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, future taxable income is estimated, considering the realization of tax loss carryforwards. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can also be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event it was determined, that the Company would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made. Conversely, if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period in which that determination is made. In its evaluation of a valuation allowance, the Company takes into account existing contracts and backlog, and the probability that options under these contract awards will be exercised as well as sales of existing products. The Company prepares profit projections based on the revenue and expenses forecast to determine that such revenues will produce sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets.
 
The Company adopted FASB ASC 740-10-50, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. ASC 740-10-50 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740-10 requires that the Company determine whether the benefits of its tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. The Company recognizes the impact of an uncertain income tax position taken on its income tax return at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. 
 
Despite the Company’s belief that its tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, one or more positions may be challenged by taxing authorities. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation.
 
Interest and penalties related to income tax matters, if applicable, will be recognized as income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not incur any expense related to interest or penalties for income tax matters, and no such amounts were accrued as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
 
m)     Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses other current liabilities approximate the fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.  The fair value of the debt approximates its carrying value at the stated discount rate of the debt to reflect recent market conditions.
 
n)     Long-Lived Assets
 
The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future, undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. No impairment losses were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 
o) Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
There were various other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
