Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Our Company
 
We are an internally-managed Maryland real estate investment trust, or REIT, focused on managing a portfolio of commercial real estate (CRE) loans and properties.  As explained further below, we are currently undertaking steps intended to increase RAIT’s liquidity and better position RAIT to meet its financial obligations as they come due.  We were formed in August 1997 and commenced operations in January 1998. A discussion of our business lines as segments is incorporated by reference to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Business Strategy
 
On September 7, 2017, we announced that our Board of Trustees, or the board, had formed a committee of independent trustees, or the special committee, to explore and evaluate a wide range of possible strategic and financial alternatives for RAIT. On February 20, 2018, we announced that the special committee had concluded this review and that the board has determined that this review did not identify a strategic or financial transaction with another counterparty that was preferable to the steps described below. This review, conducted with the support of financial and legal advisors, evaluated a wide range of potential alternatives which included, but were not limited to, (i) refinements of RAIT’s operations or strategy, (ii) financial transactions, such as a recapitalization or other change to RAIT’s capital structure and (iii) strategic transactions, such as a sale of all or part of RAIT.  As a result, the board, after considering the recommendations and advice of the special committee, RAIT’s management and legal and financial advisors, determined that RAIT should take steps to increase RAIT’s liquidity and better position RAIT to meet its financial obligations as they come due. We refer to these steps as the 2018 strategic steps and they include, but are not limited to: 

• | The cessation of our lending business along with the implementation of other steps to reduce costs within our other operating businesses;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The continuation of the process of selling our owned real estate, or REO, portfolio while continuing to service and manage our existing CRE loan portfolio; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The engagement of a financial advisor, M-III Advisory Partners, LP, to advise and assist RAIT in its ongoing assessment of its financial performance and financial needs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2017 Business Developments 
 
In 2017 and in the period in 2018 prior to the decision by the board to implement the 2018 strategic steps, we concentrated on focusing on our CRE lending business, opportunistically divesting our legacy REO portfolio and reducing our total expense base, among other things.  Key developments in 2017 included the following:

• | Property Sales
--+---------------


o | RAIT sold 18 properties which generated aggregate gross proceeds of $301.7 million.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | After repayment of debt and closing costs, RAIT received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $24.8 million.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | See “REO Portfolio” below for additional disclosure about our REO portfolio.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reductions in Compensation & General and Administrative Expenses, or G&A, Expenses
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | RAIT’s compensation and G&A expenses were $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Debt and Other Obligation Reductions
--+-------------------------------------


o | RAIT’s indebtedness, based on principal amount, declined by $368.3 million, or 20.6%, during the year ended December 31, 2017.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Total recourse debt, excluding RAIT’s secured warehouse facilities, declined by $69.4 million, or 19.2% during the year ended December 31, 2017.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | RAIT paid $20.5 million to satisfy obligation related to common share purchase warrants, or the investor warrants, and common share appreciation rights, or the investor SARs, issued by RAIT in 2012 to an investor pursuant to the exercise of a put right by that investor.

Financial Results
 
 
• | We are reporting a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, net loss allocable to common shares of $(184.7) million, or $(2.02) per common share-diluted for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $(9.8) million, or $(0.11) per common share-diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2016.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | RAIT incurred asset impairment charges of $102.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges were primarily related to certain legacy properties where we changed our investment approach to these properties during this period, which led to an expectation that the properties would be disposed of prior to the end of their useful life. These charges also included impairment charges on intangible assets related to our retail property manager, which were driven by the current challenges facing the retail property sector. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | RAIT also incurred a provision for loan losses of $45.6 million, which was primarily driven by certain legacy loans where the borrower and/or property experienced an unfavorable event or events during the year. One of these loans was a mezzanine loan with a principal balance of $18.5 million for which we recorded a provision for loan loss of $18.5 million and a full charge off of the loan during 2017, but which we continue to seek full recovery for through a legal proceeding.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | RAIT also incurred a goodwill impairment charge of $8.3 million related to our retail property manager, which was driven by the current challenges facing the retail property sector.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | During 2017, our cash available for distribution, or CAD, was $(2.6) million, or $(0.03) per common share, as compared to 40.6 million, or $0.45 per common share for 2016. CAD is a non-GAAP financial measure. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | For management’s respective definitions and discussion of the usefulness of CAD to investors, analysts and management and a reconciliation of our reported net income (loss) to our CAD, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

NYSE Continued Listing Status
 
As previously disclosed, effective September 21, 2017, RAIT received written notification, or the NYSE Notice, from the New
 York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, that RAIT was not in compliance with an NYSE continued listing standard in Rule 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the average closing price of RAIT’s common shares fell below $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period ending September 15, 2017.  RAIT has informed the NYSE that it currently intends to seek to cure the price condition by proposing a reverse stock split or other action that may require approval of its shareholders.  Under NYSE listing standards, RAIT must obtain the shareholder approval by no later than RAIT’s next annual meeting and must implement the action promptly thereafter. In this event, the price condition will be deemed cured if the price promptly exceeds $1.00 per share, and the price remains above the level for at least the following 30 trading days. Our common shares could also be delisted if the trading price of our common shares on the NYSE is abnormally low, which has generally been interpreted to mean at levels below $0.16 per share, or if our average market capitalization over a consecutive 30 day-trading period is less than $15.0 million. In these events, we would not have an opportunity to cure the deficiency, and our shares would be suspended from trading on the NYSE immediately, and the NYSE would begin the process to delist our securities, subject to RAIT’s right to appeal under NYSE rules.  We cannot assure you that any appeal we undertake in these or other circumstances will be successful. While RAIT is considering various options it may take in an effort to cure this deficiency and regain compliance with this continued listing standard, there can be no assurance that RAIT will be able to cure this deficiency or if RAIT will cease to comply with another continued listing standard of the NYSE.
 See Item 1A—“Risk Factors- General Risks-If we fail to regain and maintain compliance with the continued listing standards of the NYSE, it may result in the delisting of our common shares and other securities from the NYSE and have other negative implications under our convertible senior notes, secured notes, material agreements with lenders and counterparties and our Series C preferred shares and Series D preferred shares” below which includes risks relating to the potential consequences of our failure to meet NYSE continued listing standards.
 
Going Concern Considerations
 
Please see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements —Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Going Concern
 Considerations” and Part I, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
 Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a discussion of going concern considerations.
 
CRE Lending
 
Prior to the board’s decision to implement the 2018 strategic steps, we were in the process of seeking to focus  our business on being a full service CRE lending platform focused on the origination of first lien loans. We historically also offered mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests in limited circumstances to support first lien loans.  These represent a smaller portion of our CRE loan portfolio.  Our mezzanine loans are subordinate in repayment priority to a senior mortgage loan or loans on a property and are 
 4


typically secured by pledges of ownership interests, in whole or in part, in the entities that own the real property. We generate a return on our preferred equity investments primarily through distributions to us at a fixed rate and, in some instances, the payment of distributions may be subject to there being sufficient net cash flow from the underlying real estate to make such payments. We used this investment structure as an alternative to a mezzanine loan where the financial needs and tax situation of the borrower, the terms of senior financing secured by the underlying real estate or other circumstances necessitate holding preferred equity.  Our CRE loans are in most cases non-recourse or limited recourse loans secured by commercial real estate assets or real estate entities. This means that we look primarily to the assets securing the loan for repayment, subject to certain standard exceptions. Where possible, we sought to maintain direct lending relationships with borrowers, as opposed to investing in loans controlled by third-party lenders.  
 
Prior to our implementation of the 2018 strategic steps, our financing strategy involved the use of multiple sources of short-term financing to originate assets including warehouse facilities, repurchase agreements and bank conduit facilities.  Our ultimate goal was to finance these investments on a long-term, non-recourse, match-funded basis or to sell these assets into CMBS securitizations.  Match funding enabled us to match the interest rates and maturities of our assets with the interest rates and maturities of our financing, thereby reducing interest rate risk and funding risks in financing our portfolio on a long-term basis. 
 
During 2017, we closed two non-recourse, floating rate CMBS securitizations.  On June 23, 2017, we closed our seventh non-recourse, floating rate CMBS securitization.  The transaction involved the sale, by a RAIT subsidiary, of investment grade notes totaling approximately $342.4 million with a weighted average cost of LIBOR plus 1.44%, which provided an advance rate to the RAIT subsidiary of approximately 80.9%.  On November 30, 2017, we closed our eighth non-recourse, floating rate CMBS securitization.  The transaction involved the sale, by a RAIT subsidiary, of investment grade notes totaling approximately $259.8 million with a weighted average cost of LIBOR plus 1.29%, which provided an advance rate to the RAIT subsidiary of approximately 83.0%.  These securitizations are included in consolidated securitizations we sponsor collateralized primarily by bridge loans, which we refer to as the FL securitizations.  We act as the servicer and special servicer of each of the FL securitizations. As of December 31, 2017, we have financed a majority of our consolidated investments in CRE loans through four of the FL securitizations and two other loan securitizations, RAIT CRE CDO I, Ltd., or RAIT I, and RAIT Preferred Funding II, Ltd., or RAIT II.  We sponsored RAIT I and RAIT II in 2006 and 2007, respectively, and refer to them as our legacy CDOs. We characterize the notes issued by these securitizations as non-recourse debt to us because the noteholders generally must look to the loans collateralizing their notes for repayment. We serve as the servicer, special servicer and collateral manager for RAIT I and RAIT II. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Securitization Summary” for more information about our use of CMBS financing.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we originated $462.8 million of CRE loans and received CRE loan repayments of $453.8 million.  The tables below describe certain characteristics of our commercial mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):
  
 | Book Value | | Weighted- Average Coupon | | Range of Maturities | Number of Loans 
-----------------------------+------------+-----------+--------------------------+------+---------------------+-----------------------
Commercial Real Estate (CRE) | | | | | | | 
Commercial mortgages | $ | 1,194,016 | | 5.4 | % | Jan. 2018 to Dec. 2025 | 95 
Mezzanine loans | | 45,652 | | 11.2 | % | May 2018 to May 2025 | 13 
Preferred equity interests | | 33,283 | | 9.1 | % | Nov. 2018 to Jan. 2029 | 15 
Total CRE | $ | 1,272,951 | | 5.7 | % | | 123

 
Certain of our commercial mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests provide for the accrual of interest at specified rates which differ from current payment terms.  We refer to these loans as cash flow loans, the vast majority of which were originated prior to 2011.  Although a cash flow loan accrues interest at a stated rate, pursuant to forbearance or other agreements, the borrower is only required to pay interest each month at a minimum rate, which may be as low as zero percent, plus additional interest up to the stated rate to the extent of all cash flow from the property underlying the loan after the payment of property operating expenses.  Please see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Revenue Recognition” for further information on these loans.  As of December 31, 2017, we held investments we characterized as cash flow loans, with a recorded investment (including accrued interest) of $139.5 million comprised of preferred equity interests totaling $42.9 million, bridge loans totaling $66.0 million and mezzanine loans totaling $30.6 million.  Of these cash flow loans, $132.8 million were originated prior to 2011 and $6.7 million were originated in 2013.
 
As of December 31, 2017, our nonaccrual loans total $98.6 million and represent seven legacy loans, which is comparable to the $121.0 million of nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2016.  We remain focused on working with our borrowers on these loans to either sell or refinance the underlying properties.  As of December 31, 2017, we had a loan loss reserve of $14.9 million, representing 15.1% of our nonaccrual loans and 1.2% of our total CRE loan portfolio.  As of December 31, 2016, our loan loss reserve was $12.4 million, which represented 10.2% of our nonaccrual loans and 1.0% of our total CRE loan portfolio. During the year ended December 
 5


31, 2017, we recognized provision for loan losses of $45.6 million, which was related to our legacy CRE loans.  Our provision for loan losses during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by eight loans, where the borrower and/or property experienced an unfavorable event or events during the period.
 
We have financed our consolidated CRE loans on a long-term basis through securitizations. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Securitization Summary” for more information about our securitizations. 
 
The charts below describe the property types and the geographic breakdown of our commercial mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests as of December 31, 2017:

REO properties
 
As described above, we continue to sell and/or divest our legacy REO portfolio.  During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold eighteen properties (which included the sale of two separate parcels comprising a retail property in two separate transactions) for $301.7 million which generated a $20.3 million GAAP gain.  We also recognized a gain of $3.2 million related to a sale that occurred during the second quarter of 2015, which was previously deferred. The proceeds from the sales were used to reduce debt, and the sales generated $24.8 million of net proceeds to us.  As of December 31, 2017, our real estate portfolio consisted of an aggregate gross cost (carrying value) of $274.7 million ($245.9 million), comprised of $130.1 million ($110.9 million) of office properties, $17.2 million ($13.1 million) of multifamily properties, $106.8 million ($101.3 million) of retail properties, and $20.6 million ($20.6 million) of land.  We expect to dispose of additional REO properties with an aggregate gross cost (carrying value), as of December 31, 2017, of approximately $176.8 million ($167.4 million) during 2018.  
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized impairment charges on real estate assets of $96.6 million as it was more likely than not that we would dispose of the assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives and a portion of our recorded investment in these assets was determined to not be recoverable.  These impairment charges are further described below.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we changed our investment approach on six of our real estate properties. These decisions to change our investment approach led to an expectation that the properties would be disposed of prior to the end of their useful life, which was concluded to be a triggering event requiring further analysis of the recoverability of these properties. The analysis indicated that the aggregate carrying value of these properties was determined not to be fully recoverable, resulting in impairment charges totaling $74.5 million as further described below:  
 
 
• | Four of these six properties, consisting of an office property and a retail property in the Central region, and a retail property and a land parcel in the Southeast region, were previously in various stages of redevelopment with an aggregate carrying value of $101.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, a decision was made to cease redevelopment efforts and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

market the properties for sale in their existing condition. The analysis performed, which included obtaining a broker opinion of value for each of the Central region properties and performing a discounted cash flow analysis for each of the Southeast region properties using market-based assumptions, resulted in impairment charges of $50.3 million. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For one office property in the Central region, which was previously planned to be held for use and currently not stabilized, a sales process was pursued for the property in its current condition. Based upon various offers that have been received to purchase the property, the carrying value of $39.3 million was determined to not be fully recoverable, resulting in an impairment charge of $17.4 million. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Additionally, it was determined it was more likely than not that we would dispose of one retail property in the Mid-Atlantic region with a carrying value of $30.9 million, which was being held for investment, in the foreseeable future. The analysis performed, which included performing a discounted cash flow analysis using market-based assumptions, resulted in an impairment charge of $6.8 million. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Subsequently, during the year ended December 31, 2017, one of the above mentioned real estate properties that was previously determined to be more likely than not to be disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life incurred capital expenditures, which led to additional impairment charges totaling $3.5 million.  In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we determined that one of the above mentioned real estate properties would be sold at a lower price than previously expected, resulting in an impairment charge totaling $2.9 million. 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we continued execution on plans to market certain assets that had been identified for disposal in previous periods.  The remaining $15.7 million of impairment charges during year ended December 31, 2017 related to nine of these other real estate assets, including one multifamily property, one retail property, five office properties, and two land parcels and was recognized as a result of updated information obtained based upon purchase and sale agreements, letters of intent and broker opinions of value as these assets have progressed through different stages of the marketing and sales negotiation process.
 
We are continuing to market for sale a majority of our real estate properties, and the ultimate outcomes of the sales of those properties is dependent on current market conditions and demand specific to each individual property. As we identify properties for disposition, our decision to no longer hold them for investment may result in future impairment charges. 
 
We have financed our portfolio of investments in commercial real estate through secured mortgages held by either third-party lenders or our commercial real estate securitizations.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred a non-cash gain on deconsolidation of properties of $5.2 million relating to an industrial real estate portfolio containing ten properties with carrying value of $82.5 million of investments in real estate and $81.9 million of related cross-collateralized non-recourse debt as of December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the senior lender foreclosed on the mortgage liens encumbering all of these industrial properties, respectively, and disposed of the properties through auction processes. RAIT had no control or influence over the divestiture processes. These properties, including other assets, net of related liabilities, had an aggregate carrying value of $82.0 million. As a result, the senior lender or its assignee/designee now owns these properties, subject to any redemption rights that we have under applicable state law, if any. Upon foreclosure, we derecognized these net assets and extinguished related debt of $87.2 million based on the proceeds received by and legal stipulations entered into with the senior lender with respect to the auctions. 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred a non-cash gain on deconsolidation of properties of $0.7 million relating to a real estate portfolio containing two office and two industrial properties with a carrying value of $16.2 million and $17.7 million of related non-recourse debt as of December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the senior lender foreclosed on the mortgage liens encumbering these four properties and disposed of the properties through an external foreclosure process. RAIT had no control or influence over the divestiture process. These four properties, including other assets, net of related liabilities, had an aggregate carrying value of $17.6 million. Upon foreclosure, we derecognized these net assets and extinguished related debt of $18.3 million based on the proceeds received by the senior lender at the foreclosure.

Asset Management and Loan Servicing

We manage a portfolio of real estate related assets. As of December 31, 2017, we had $2.8 billion of assets under management, or AUM. AUM are comprised primarily of our consolidated assets and assets of third parties to which we provide property management services. We serve as collateral manager, servicer and/or special servicer to the securitizations we consolidate. Our subsidiary, Urban Retail Properties, LLC, or Urban Retail, provides property management services to office and retail properties. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Assets Under Management” below. As previously disclosed, we are actively pursuing the sale of Urban Retail and do not expect any such sale to have a material effect on our financial statements, though we cannot assure you that we will successfully complete any such sale.
Certain REIT and Investment Company Act Limits On Our Strategies
 
REIT Limits
 
We conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT. We also conduct the operations of our subsidiaries, Taberna Realty Finance Trust, or TRFT, RAIT-Melody 2016 Holdings Trust, or Melody FL-5, RAIT-Melody 2017 Holdings Trust, or Melody FL-6, and any REITs we may sponsor or otherwise consolidate in the future, which we collectively refer to as our REIT affiliates, to each qualify as 
 8


a REIT. Please see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 14: Income Taxes” for further discussion. Our exit of our Taberna securitization segment in 2014 did not involve selling TRFT, which continues to hold assets and liabilities unrelated to the Taberna segment. For a discussion of the tax implications of our and our REIT affiliates’ REIT status to us and our shareholders, see “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To qualify as a REIT, we and our REIT affiliates must continually satisfy various tests regarding sources of income, nature and diversification of assets, amounts distributed to shareholders and the ownership of common shares. In order to satisfy these tests, we and our REIT affiliates may be required to forgo investments that might otherwise be made. Accordingly, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our or our REIT affiliates’ investment performance. These requirements include the following:
  
• | For each of ourselves and our REIT affiliates, at least 75% of total assets and 75% of gross income must be derived from qualifying real estate assets, whether or not such assets would otherwise represent our or our REIT affiliates’ best investment alternative. For example, since our investments in the debt or equity of certain securitizations are not qualifying real estate assets, to the extent that we have historically invested in such assets, or may do so in the future, we must hold substantial investments in qualifying real estate assets, including mortgage loans and CMBS, which may have lower yields than such investments. Also, at least 95% of each of our and our REIT affiliates’ gross income in each taxable year, excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the 75% gross income test described above, as well as other dividends, interest, and gain from the sale or disposition of shares or securities, which need not have any relation to real property.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A REIT’s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, but including any mortgage loans, held in inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. The prohibited transaction tax may apply to any sale of assets to a securitization and to any sale of securitization securities, and therefore may limit our and our REIT affiliates’ ability to sell assets to or equity in securitizations and other assets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Overall, no more than 25% (20% for years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the value of a REIT’s assets may consist of securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs. During 2016, we restructured certain of our TRS entities by moving four former separate TRSs under a single TRS holding company (RAIT JV TRS Sub, LLC) in order to streamline our business operations and decrease administrative processes. Our TRSs that currently hold assets include: RAIT JV TRS Sub, LLC (the holding company for our interest in RAIT Urban Holdings, LLC, the entities that issued our junior subordinated notes and the entity party to our CMBS facilities referred to below), Taberna Equity Funding, Ltd. (the holding company for equity issued by a securitization) and RAIT Sharpstown TRS LLC (the holding company for a 1% ownership interest of a retail center located in Houston, Texas). Our and our REIT affiliates’ use of fee-generating businesses held in a TRSs, as well as the business of future TRSs we or our REIT affiliates may form, will be limited by our and our REIT affiliates’ need to meet this 25% (20% for years beginning after December 31, 2017) test, though we do not currently expect to expand these businesses under the 2018 strategic steps.

• | The REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code limit our and our REIT affiliates’ ability to hedge mortgage-backed securities, preferred securities and related borrowings. Except to the extent provided by the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department, or the Treasury regulations, any income from a hedging transaction we or our REIT affiliates enter into in the normal course of business primarily to manage risk of interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made, or ordinary obligations incurred or to be incurred, to acquire or carry real estate assets, which is clearly identified as specified in the Treasury regulations before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into, including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction, will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 95% gross income test (and will generally constitute non-qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test). To the extent that we or our REIT affiliates enter into other types of hedging transactions, which we do not currently expect to do under the 2018 strategic steps, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non- qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests. As a result, we or our REIT affiliates might have to limit use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through TRSs. This could increase the cost of our or our REIT affiliates’ hedging activities or expose it or us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we or it would otherwise want to bear.

Investment Company Act Limits
 
We seek to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company. Under Section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act, a company is not deemed to be an “investment company” if:

• | it neither is, nor holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, nor proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | it neither is engaged nor proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and does not own or propose to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets exclusive of government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40% test. “Investment securities” excludes U.S. government securities and securities of majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act (relating to issuers whose securities are held by not more than 100 persons or whose securities are held only by qualified purchasers, as defined).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We rely on the 40% test because we are a holding company that conducts our businesses through wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries. As a result, the securities issued by our subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of “investment company” under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a combined value in excess of 40% of the value of our total assets exclusive of government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis. Based on the relative value of our investment in TRFT, on the one hand, and our investment in RAIT Partnership, on the other hand, we can comply with the 40% test only if RAIT Partnership itself complies with the 40% test (or an exemption other than those provided by Sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7)). Because the principal exemptions that RAIT Partnership relies upon to allow it to meet the 40% test are those provided by Sections 3(c)(5)(C) or 3(c)(6) (relating to subsidiaries primarily engaged in specified real estate activities), we are limited in the types of businesses in which we may engage through our subsidiaries.
 
None of RAIT, RAIT Partnership or any of their subsidiaries has received a no-action letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, regarding whether it complies with the Investment Company Act or how its investment or financing strategies fit within the exclusions from regulation under the Investment Company Act that it is using. To the extent that the SEC provides more specific or different guidance regarding, for example, the treatment of assets as qualifying real estate assets or real estate-related assets, we may be required to adjust these investment and financing strategies accordingly. See Item 1A—“Risk Factors—Other Regulatory and Legal Risks of Our Business- Loss of our Investment Company Act exemption would affect us adversely.”
 
Competition
 
We have historically been subject to significant competition in all aspects of our business. Prior to our decision to implement the 2018 strategic steps, existing industry participants and potential new entrants have competed with us for the available supply of investments suitable for origination or acquisition, as well as for debt and equity capital. We also saw increasing amounts of competition from new entrants in the market to originate conduit loans and bridge loans. We have competed with many third parties engaged in real estate finance and investment activities, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. With respect to our investments in real estate, we face significant competition from other owners, operators and developers of properties, many of which own properties similar to ours in markets where we operate. Competition may increase, and other companies and funds with investment objectives similar to ours may be organized in the future. Some of these competitors have, or in the future may have, substantially greater financial resources than we do and may also enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. With respect to our Urban Retail property management businesses, we face competition from other property managers with respect to properties owned by unaffiliated third parties, primarily retail properties. After the implementation of the 2018 strategic steps, our competition will focus on other sellers of assets similar to those in our portfolio.
Employees
 
As of March 1, 2018, we had 223 employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

 Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 
 
On March 12, 2018, RAIT Financial Trust (“RAIT”), RAIT Partnership, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”), Taberna Realty Finance Trust (“TRFT”), and RAIT Asset Holdings IV, LLC (“RAIT IV” and together with RAIT, the Operating Partnership and TRFT, the “ Issuer Parties”) and ARS VI Investor I, LP, (formerly known as ARS VI Investor I, LLC (the “Investor”) entered into an Extension Agreement (the “Extension Agreement”) relating to the previously disclosed Securities Purchase Agreement (as amended on or prior to the date hereof, the “Purchase Agreement”) dated as of October 1, 2012 between the Issuer Parties and the Investor related to the Investor’s purchase of the Series D preferred shares and further described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
By letter dated February 14, 2018 (the “February Letter”) to RAIT, the Operating Partnership and RAIT IV, the Investor described purported breaches of the Securities Purchase Agreement and other documents related to the Series D preferred shares.  The February Letter also stated that, unless the Investor extended or revoked the February Letter, it would become effective at a defined date (the “Effective Date”) as to the Investor’s notice of such breaches, that such breaches constituted both a default event and a mandatory redemption triggering event as defined in the documents related to the Series D preferred shares and the exercise of the Investor’s mandatory redemption right.  RAIT, the Operating Partnership and RAIT IV dispute the existence of any such breaches and the existence of a default event and a mandatory redemption triggering event.  Pursuant to the Extension Agreement, the Effective Date was extended to June 9, 2018 (the “Extended Effective Date Period”) in order to permit the parties additional time to engage in discussions concerning, among other things, the contents of the February Letter and the Redemption Transaction (defined below).  The extension provided by the Extension Agreement is revoked if certain defined events occur, including bankruptcy related events.  The Extension Agreement provides that, during the Extended Effective Date Period, the Investor shall refrain from exercising any of its rights or remedies solely as they relate to any failure by RAIT to maintain the listing or trading of any of RAIT’s securities on the NYSE or other defined trading markets. 
 
150


During the Extended Effective Date Period, the Issuer Parties have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to sell specified assets of RAIT IV on or prior to July 1, 2018.  The Extension Agreement provides that the net proceeds of any such sales will be used to facilitate RAIT’s redemption of the RAIT IV preferred units and the linked Series D preferred shares, in each case, held by the Investor  (collectively, the “Redemption Transaction”).  A portion of these assets was sold on March 12, 2018 and the resulting expected Redemption Transaction is described under the caption “Item 8.01 Other Events” below.  The Extension Agreement provides that if the remaining specified assets are sold and the net proceeds result in Redemption Transactions reducing the remaining aggregate liquidation preference of the remaining outstanding Series D preferred shares to $12,235,000 (increased by any shortfall in net proceeds if those assets are sold below par), then, among other things, the remaining Series D preferred shares would be converted into a new series of RAIT’s preferred shares on a parity with RAIT’s other outstanding preferred shares and the Investor’s rights under the Securities Purchase Agreement and its related documents would be terminated and/or amended, as applicable. 
 
The above summary of the Extension Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the Extension Agreement attached to this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibit 10.14.5 and incorporated by reference herein. 
 
Andrew M. Silberstein serves as a Trustee on RAIT’s Board of Trustees as the Investor Board Designee (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). Mr. Silberstein is an equity owner of Almanac Realty Investors, LLC (“Almanac”), an officer of the Investor and holds indirect equity interests in the Investor.  As previously disclosed, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, RAIT sold to the Investor on a private placement basis in four sales between October 2012 and March 2014 for an aggregate purchase price of $100,000,000 the following securities, in the aggregate: (i) 4,000,000 Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest, par value $0.01 per share, of RAIT (the “Series D Preferred Shares”), (ii) common share purchase warrants exercisable for RAIT common shares (the “Common Shares”) and (iii) common share appreciation rights with respect to Common Shares. In December 2016, RAIT repurchased and canceled 464,000 Series D Preferred Shares for a purchase price of $11,600,000 and, in June 2017, RAIT repurchased and canceled 402,280 Series D Preferred Shares for a purchase price of $10,057,000, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends to but excluding the date of repurchase held by the Investor (which repurchase included the corresponding repurchase of preferred units in RAIT IV held by the Investor). As of the date hereof, the remaining number of RAIT securities held by the Investor are 3,133,720 Series D Preferred Shares, which represents all of the outstanding Series D Preferred Shares (and a corresponding number of outstanding preferred units of RAIT IV.  For further information about RAIT’s transactions with the Investor and its affiliates, see note 10 and note 15 to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   
 
The disclosure below is provided, at our option, regarding events which we deem of importance to our securities holders in accordance with Item 8.01 “Other Events” of Form 8-K.
