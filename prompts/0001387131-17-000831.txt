Primary Products

Our primary products include Absorbable PA Osteosynthesis Devices made of a proprietary polyamide material. These advanced materials are used in surgical screws, binding wires, rods and related medical devices for the treatment of orthopedic trauma, sports-related medical treatment, cartilage repair, and related treatments, and reconstructive dental procedures. Our devices are Self-Reinforced, Bio-absorbable, Brady-degradable internal fixation devices. At this time, ABMT is the sole patent holder of PA technologies in China, as well as the only company currently engaged in clinical trials and marketing submission for PA devices in the PRC. Our PA Screws have completed clinical trials and are pending approval by the China Food and Drug Administration of China (“CFDA”); and our PA Binding Wires are under clinical trials; and our PA Mini-Screws are under animal test.
Product Characteristics:

The theory of Brady-degradable PA absorbable material is based on water dissolution, that is, the material is broken down by body fluids in a predictable and carefully engineered fashion. As a bone fracture heals, the supporting implant is designed to degrade from the outer to the inner layers, inducing new bone generation in the gap left by the degrading material. Eventually, new bone is formed to occupy all of the space left by the degraded implant.

Brady-degradable PA absorbable materials consist of enhanced fiber and high molecular polymers. It has high tensile, bending, and shear strengths, and is particularly suitable for patients with severe conditions, high tensile, bending, and shear strengths, and is particularly suitable for patients with severe conditions, such as fractures with light osteoporosis, severe soft tissue injury or bad blood supply, and so forth. This innovative material provides several benefits:

1. Reduces costs on all patient medical care, 
2. Helps avoid the necessity for secondary surgery, 
3. Enhances the performance of components constructed from these materials, 
4. Improves the biological activity of components employing these materials, 
5. Effectively controls the degeneration speed of the temporary support component.

The Company has developed six proprietary re-absorbable polymer fixation implant product lines, including screws, pins, tacks, rods and binding wires, which provide an alternative to metal implants and overcome the limitations of first generation re-absorbable fixation devices. The Company’s product range will ultimately cover the full gamut of components featuring self-reinforced, re-absorbable, biodegradable PA macromolecule polymer materials for implantation, including human orthopedic and dental applications, as well as veterinary applications.

Industry Development

The fracture fixation industry has developed through three generations of materials science:

The first generation internal-fracture fixation material:
The first generation internal-fracture-fixer components are usually made of stainless steel, titanium and alloy. Due to their high intensity, low costs and easy machining character, these components have achieved huge success in fracture treatment and remain the most widely used internal-fracture-fixer material. However, their prominent flaws are the huge difference between metal’s elasticity co-efficient, easily causing second-time bone fracture. The metallic ion can also cause tissue inflammation, and the need of a secondary surgery to have them taken out. These flaws stimulated the development of the degradable macromolecule material.

The second generation fracture fixation material:
The second generation bone-fracture-fixed components are made of degradable macromolecule material, such as PLLA, PGA and PDS, etc. The disadvantage of these components is rapid self-degeneration in early stages after the initial implant. For example, the strength of SR-PLLA decreases to 10-20 Mpa after 4 weeks of implantation. Therefore, the second generation bone-fracture-fixed components can be only used to treat substantial spongiosa bone fractures.

The third generation fracture fixation material:
The third generation fracture fixation material, biodegradable fracture fixation components are currently under research by developed countries. There are many technical challenges to research in the third generation fracture fixation material field; for example, the materials must have a high degree of bio-compatibility and mechanical compatibility. They also must be of high biological activity, self-absorbable, and degeneration controllable.

Product Development

After careful deliberation, we selected the biodegradable screw as our first product to market. In order to replace the widely-used metal components, the new materials must meet multiple bio-consistency and mechanical-consistency requirements. Furthermore, they must also exhibit specific properties with respect to bio-activities, degradability, and controllable degradation speed. Although many macromolecule materials are degradable inside human body, relatively few provide the physical characters required for fracture fixation.

Development began with selection of macromolecule materials that exhibited the desired physical characters, leading, ultimately, to our selection of polyamide. In order to achieve the desired mechanical performance and degrading speed, various chemical and physical techniques were employed to modify the bio-degradable polyamide so as to synthesize the required new bio-degradable material. This phase of our research also entailed the selection of monomer class, polymerization conditions, the mensuration of polymer molecular weight, hydrophile capability, crystal capability, the mensuration and controlled degrading speed of the polymer, the mensuration and control of the mechanical performance of the polymer, and numerous other critical considerations.

Our next challenge was to identify a suitable bio-active inorganic material, and to optimize the compound and associated production conditions. It was critical that we could predict and control the bio-activities of the implanted fixture material, and to this end we used high grade and mature phosphate type bio-active materials, taking into account the preparation characteristics of the compound material, and the surface character requirements of the finished products. We also improved current technical parameters by modifying the surface character, thereby achieving critical control over the desired grain size and surface activities.

The third technological hurdle involved the actual preparation and utilization of the engineered compound in conjunction with a bio-active material. Hydronium bombardment of the surface, with spread and cover techniques, was employed during this critical step in the process. This had the effect of creating a well-knit bio-active membrane on the degradable polymer’s surface, and embedding a bio-active core inside the degradable polymer stick, so as to form the bio-active degradable compound material.

The final step entailed strengthening and shaping the processed compound by using directional extrusion and molding. Degradable acantha inoculators, fixation screws, orthopedics stuffing, enlace strings, and anti-conglutination membrane can all be manufactured, as needed, using this same technique.

Our company has studied and researched Polyamide, changing its chemical and physical properties to meet the above requirements.  As a result of our research we have:

1.     Increased mechanical strength to 170 Mpa. 
2.     Increased biological activities to accelerate bone cell substitution. 
3.     Extended the degeneration period during the implant. While the PA is degenerating layer by layer, the bone cells grow and take its place.

Product Analysis

Our Company is researching and currently developing the capability of manufacturing several different kinds of human implant products including Artificial Lumbar Disc, Mini-Screws, Suture Anchors, reconstructive dental devices and other PA products. Currently the company has two production lines certified by the GMP regulations.

Our Company is constantly analyzing the market needs to develop suitable products. One of the company’s products is currently pending CFDA approval and two products are under clinical tests.

Overview of PA Devices and Market in the US, China and Worldwide

Fractures are among the most common orthopaedic problems. There are estimated 1.5 million fracture cases each year in the United States alone (Riggs and Melton 1995), and the average citizen in a developed country can expect to sustain two fractures over the course of their lifetime. Fractures occur at an annual rate of 2.4 per 100 population. Men are more likely to experience fractures (2.8 per 100 population) than women (2.0 per 100). In 1998, over 10.7 million fractures were seen by physicians in office-based practice (this included visits for follow-up care). Of these, approximately 8.6 million visits for fracture care (79.6%) were made to orthopaedic surgeons. When a fracture was referred to another physician, approximately 90.6% were referred to orthopaedic surgeons. (Data Source: National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey & American Academy of Orthopaedic).

Hip fracture rates are increasing throughout urban Asia. A landmark study from Beijing 2002–2006 indicates the hip fracture incidence in those aged over 50 years to be 229/100,000 per year in women and 129/100,000 per year in men. This study found the rates of age-specific hip fractures in those aged over 50 years increased by 58% in women and by 49% in men. The same study also compared hip fractures that occurred from 2002-2006 with those that had occurred previously from 1990-1992, and it was found that the adjusted age-specific rates of hip fracture over age 50 years increased 2.76-fold in women and 1.61-fold in men. The increasing rate of hip fractures is serious since they are associated with increased mortality. In Mainland China, 1.8 million new osteoporotic vertebral fractures occurred in 2006. Since the number of people aged older than 60 years is expected to approach 438 million by 2050, it can be projected that the number of Chinese in this age group with osteoporotic vertebral fractures could reach 36.7 million and 48.5 million in 2020 and 2050, respectively. (Data Source: International Osteoporosis Foundation).

The demand for internal fixation medical devices has rapidly increased during the last decade. The combined global market sales for orthopaedic device for year 2012 and 2015 is $43.1 billion and $47.2 billion respectively, an increase of 3.1% each year. There are over 1 million bone fractures in patients in China requiring about 4 million bone bolts/screws each year. Research shows that in the next 10-15 years, China will have a booming aging population and the population in China will continue to increase. The sales of internal fixation medical devices in China reached $1.3 billion in 2013 and it is expected to increase at 18% each year. New and improved medical technology will continue to rapidly grow throughout hospitals in China, and material optimization and product pricing is expected to directly stimulate increased sales.

China’s Market for PA Devices

China’s market for PA devices depends on 3 major conditions:

 - patients 
 - advanced technology level 
 - performance and price of the materials.

In the first 50 years of the 21st century, China will have a growing aging population, while the total population in China will continually increase. New and improved medical technologies will be rapidly developed and utilized throughout hospitals in China, and material optimization and product pricing is expected to directly stimulate increased sales.

Competitive Analysis

Our Company is the only patent holder of PA technologies in China, as well as the only company carrying out Clinical Trials on PA products in China. At this time there are no similar products in this market (bio-degradable internal fixation devices that degrade without acids or other non-naturally occurring substances). Moreover, due to the nature of the regulatory environment, and the requirements and logistics of mounting a clinical trial, it would take any new competitor a minimum of three years to catch up to our lead in this area alone. Factoring in our established relationships with key customers, distributors, and regulators, as well as our ready-to-run production facilities, and our actual advantage is considerable longer than the 3 year regulatory advantage. This represents an invaluable window in which to firmly entrench our company as the preferred purveyor of self-reinforced, absorbable biodegradable PA components in the Chinese health care environment. 

To reiterate, our company and product line offer several critical competitive advantages, specifically:


● | There are no similar patent registrations in China.
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Our initial product, the PA Screw, has completed 100% of the required clinical trials, with a 100% success rate, and now await the formality of CFDA approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are the only company qualified and permitted to conduct clinical trials of other PA products by China’s CFDA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have a timing advantage over other companies in China, which would have to go through the preclinical testing before they could even apply for a permit to conduct actual clinical trials.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Under existing regulation structure, it will take at least 3 years for any competitor’s clinical trials to be completed, and total of 7 or more years to reach the point where we are now.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Specific Competition

Competition in the medical implant device industry is intense both in China and in global markets. In orthopedics, ABMT’s principal competitors are the numerous companies that sell metal implants. ABMT competes with the manufacturers and marketers of metal implants by emphasizing the ease of implantation of the Company’s Self-Reinforced, Bio-absorbable, Brady-degradable implants, the cost effectiveness of such products, and the elimination of risks associated with the necessity of performing removal surgeries frequently required with less modern products.

Within the resorbable implant market, ABMT is competing with other manufacturers of resorbable internal fixation devices primarily on the basis of the physiological strength of ABMT’s polymers and the length of the strength retention time demonstrated by ABMT’s formulations. In order to replace the widely-used metal components, the new materials must meet numerous bioconsistency and mechanical-consistency requirements. Furthermore, they must also exhibit specific properties with respect to bio-activities, degradability, and controllable degradation speed. Although many macromolecule materials are degradable inside human body, relatively few provide the physical characters required for fracture fixation.

Our primary competition will be the generation-one and generation-two counterparts, which, despite their functional inferiority, enjoy the benefit of familiarity and an established manufacturing and marketing base. This competition comes from a number of entrenched players worldwide, including Acumed, Biomet, Inc., Conmed Corp., Encore Orthopedics, Exactech, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, DePuy, Inc., Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc., Orthofix International N.V., Smith and Nephew Plc, Stryker Corp., Synthes, Inion, Ltd. and others. Although many of these competitors have substantially greater resources upon which to draw, we are confident that the technological superiority of the more forward-looking product will ultimately equalize the playing field by orthopaedic innovation.

For the past 20 years, titanium has been the most widely used, and the most expensive material for fixing fractures (in both elective and emergency surgery). Although metal exhibits the desired strength and rigidity to allow the healing process to begin, there are a number of issues associated with using permanent titanium systems. Biodegradable plating systems deliver many of the benefits of their metal counterparts, without the disadvantages.

There are a number of marketers and manufacturers of PLA and PLLA--the first generation of Self-degradable, absorbable, orthopedic internal fixation devices in China. (Note: Titanium screws cost as much as $2200.)

Other foreign companies that produce PLA, PLLA or titanium, stainless products, but have less marketing in China are:

● DePuy (Johnson & Johnson)
●  Medtronic 
● Stryker Corp. 
● Zimmer Biomet 
● Smith & Nephew 
● Inion

Product advantage and Market Opportunity:


- | There are no similar patent registrations in China.
--+----------------------------------------------------


- | We are the only company qualified and permitted to take clinical trials by China CFDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | We have a timing advantage over other companies in China which would have to go through the preclinical testing for the CFDA permit on Clinical Trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Under existing regulation by CFDA, it will take at least 3-5 years to complete clinical trials for a new product similar to the Company’s PA Screw, which has finished all required clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Product Comparisons

Among many other advantages, a main advantage of ABMT’s proprietary PA technology is the elimination of the need for secondary surgery to remove an implantation device. Implant removal belongs to the most common elective orthopaedic procedures in industrial countries. In children, implant removal may be necessary to remove implants early to avoid disturbances to the growing skeleton, to prevent their bony immuring making later removal technically difficult or impossible, and to allow for planned reconstructive surgery after skeletal maturation (e.g., in case of hip dysplasia). In adults, pain, soft tissue irritation, the resumption of strenuous activities or contact sports after fracture healing, and the patient’s demand are typical indications for implant removal in clinical practice. However, implant removal requires a second surgical procedure in scarred tissue, and poses a risk for nerve damage and re-fractures. (cite: Hanson et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2008)

1Titanium and aluminum has been traced in serum and hair of 16 of 46 patients after receiving titanium implants. (cite: Kasai Y, Iida R, Uchida A: Metal concentrations in the serum and hair of patients with titanium alloy spinal implants.)

2Implant removal belongs to the most common elective orthopaedic procedures in the industrial countries. In a frequently cited Finnish study, implant removal contributed to almost 30% of all planned orthopaedic operations, and 15% of all operations.(cite: Bostman O, Pihlajamaki H: Routine implant removal after fracture surgery: a potentially reducible consumer of hospital resources in trauma units.)

 

Towards the end of the last century, spinal and orthopedic implants evolved towards progressively stronger and stiffer devices, as it was presumed that increased construct rigidity would optimize the biological milieu and provide more rapid and robust healing and arthrodesis. For the past 20 years, titanium has been the most widely used, and the most expensive material for fixing fractures (in both elective and emergency surgery). More than 1,000 tons (2.2 million pounds) of titanium devices of every description and function are implanted in patients worldwide each year. Although metal exhibits the desired strength and rigidity to allow the healing process to begin, there are a number of issues associated with using permanent titanium systems. Biodegradable systems deliver many of the benefits of their metal counterparts, without the disadvantages:
