Corporate History

TurnKey Capital, Inc. (formerly Train Travel Holdings, Inc.) (the Company, we, or us) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name of Vanell, Corp. on September 7, 2012 (Inception). The Company changed its name to Train Travel Holdings, Inc. on March 20, 2014 and to TurnKey Capital, Inc. on January 15, 2016. 

From Inception in 2012 through December 2013, our business operations were limited primarily to the development of a business plan to provide consulting services to commercial growers of coffee in El Salvador, the completion of private placements for the offer and sale of our common stock, discussing the offers of consulting services with potential customers, and the signing of the service agreement with Finca La Esmeralda, a private El-Salvadorian company. We discontinued our coffee business on January 23, 2014.

Commencing January 23, 2014 until July 2015, our business plan changed to the acquisition and operation of entertainment train companies, as well as managing and providing consulting services to entertainment train companies. Since January 2014 our management has spent all of its time and effort on developing our business plan, including identifying specific entertainment railroad acquisition targets, engaging in discussions with these potential targets to ascertain the potential level of interest, negotiating general terms with targets, and undertaking early stage due diligence of potential targets. As a result, we entered into non-binding letters of intent with two acquisition candidates and subsequently performed initial stage due diligence. In one case, the railroad was in such disrepair we determined the acquisition was not feasible at the price being sought by the target. In another case, we determined the price was too high based on our due diligence and could not reach an agreement with the potential seller. We also entered into a series of agreements to operate a dinner train in Missouri which were subsequently unwound. In light of the forgoing, our management has looked to potential new lines of business in addition to pursuing our current line of business. 

On July 6, 2015, the Company completed a share exchange agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement) with Turnkey Home Buyers USA, Inc., a Florida corporation (Turnkey), TBG Holdings Corporation (TBG), each of the Turnkey shareholders and Train Travel Holdings, Inc., a Florida corporation. The Company, Turnkey, TBG and Train Travel Holdings, Inc., a Florida corporation, are all under the common control of Neil Swartz and Tim Hart. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, Turnkey shareholders transferred to the Company all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Turnkeys shareholders. In exchange for the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Turnkey, the Company issued 15,337,500 shares of its common stock to Turnkey shareholders. Prior to closing, TBG, a principal shareholder of the Company and Turnkey, tendered to Turnkey for cancellation 15,000,000 shares of Turnkey common stock.
 
The Company shares issued to the Turnkey shareholders were not registered and were issued in a transaction which was exempt from the registration requirements pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. Each of the Turnkey shareholders were accredited investors and no underwriters or placement agents were involved.

As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Turnkey shareholders owned 38.9% of the Companys common stock and 58.5% of the fully diluted common stock as a result of their ownership of the outstanding preferred stock.

Due to the common control of Turnkey and the Company, pursuant to ASC 805-50-25, Transactions Between Entities Under Common Control and other SEC guidance including for lack of economic substance, the Share Exchange Agreement was accounted for as a transfer of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities under the predecessor value method of accounting. Financial statement presentation under the predecessor values method of accounting as a result of a business combination between entities under common control requires the receiving entity (i.e., the Company) to report the results of operations as if both entities had always been combined. The consolidated financial statements include both entities full results since the inception of Turnkey on September 12, 2014.

TurnKey Business

Founded in September 2014, Turnkey offers clients a full suite of services for residential and commercial real estate transactions. As part of the acquisition, the Company acquired Turnkeys subsidiary, a real estate brokerage firm, to handle the sales transactions. Turnkey generates revenue in three primary ways: coaching and mentoring real estate investors to improve their returns, leasing and sales of quality turnkey rental properties, and brokerage of residential and commercial transactions.

In September 2014, Turnkey acquired the intellectual properties of Robert Blair Real Estate, which included videos, instructional books, and an established real estate investor education program. Prior to September 2014, Turnkeys current management team has been mentoring real estate investors for over 20 years.

Turnkeys Single-Family Rental home division has developed an acquisition platform that is capable of acquiring large numbers of properties across many acquisition channels in multiple markets. When identifying desirable markets, the company focuses on steady population growth, strong rental demand and a desirable level of distressed sales of homes that can be acquired below replacement cost, providing for attractive potential rental yields and capital appreciation. More specifically, the company looks to acquire single-family homes in select submarkets that are appealing to middle income families, based on its disciplined market selection criteria, such as above-average median household incomes, well-regarded school districts, proximity to employment centers and lifestyle amenities, access to transportation routes and public transit and low crime levels. Turnkey believes that homes in these areas will attract tenants with strong credit profiles, produce high occupancy/rental rates, providing for long-term property appreciation potential. For the past year we have not generated any revenues from the real estate business.

ROM Business

On September 1, 2016, the Company formed a new subsidiary, Remote Office Management, Inc. (ROM) to market bundled accounting and computer/IT services. Simultaneously, ROM entered into a professional services agreement with R3 Accounting, (an accounting firm owned by Timothy Hart, a director, secretary and CFO of the Company) and PC Lauderdale (an unrelated computer/IT company). The purpose of the agreement was to form a joint venture where by these entities would cross market professional services under ROM for one stop computer/IT and accounting services. Through ROM, we generated revenues of $119,500 for 2017 from accounting and computer/IT services. These services were provided to affiliates.

On June 30, 2017, the Company, entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement (the Agreement) with Seminole Indian Company (SIC), a company controlled by Chief James E. Billie and Craig Talesman. The purpose and intent of this Agreement is to combine the resources and talents of, TKCI and SIC, in order to take advantage of every opportunity permitted by tribal sovereignty to create revenue streams in multiple areas in conjunction with operating partners that have existing marketing and customers in place, thereby limiting the capital requirements and risk. The Company believes that structuring operations with Tribal Sovereignty should facilitate the delivery of the financial advantages of operating in a tax-free environment with limited liability, plus other benefits such as permit and zoning ease, supporting an ideal structure for investment capital and successful entrepreneurial ventures. The Company does not have any paid employees, however the officers and directors continue to work to further the Companys business objectives. To date there have been no revenues pursuant to this alliance and there are no pending contracts or agreements.

Risks and Challenges

Limited Operating History. The Company was established on September 7, 2012 and has been attempting to develop unrelated businesses. We have had no operating history upon which an investor may rely. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties the Company is likely to encounter in view of the fact that it has not yet commenced operations, including, but not limited to, competition and unanticipated costs and expenses. There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully implement its new business or other business plans.
We Need Additional Capital To Fund Our Planned Operations. The Company does not have cash reserves available to meet its basic operational requirements and will be dependent upon the sale of its common stock and, or, other financing to fund potential acquisitions as well as covering our basic overhead expenses. We expect to fund our general operations for the next 6 -12 months with the private sale of our common stock or from funding provided by our officers or affiliates. There is no assurance we can raise the capital we need or that a financing will be at terms satisfactory to us. We currently have no commitment for financing.
