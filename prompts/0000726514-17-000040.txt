Business Overview
Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (ESI, we, our, or the Company) is a leading supplier of innovative laser-based microfabrication solutions for industries reliant on microtechnologies. ESI's integrated solutions allow industrial designers and process engineers to control the power of laser light to transform materials in ways that differentiate their consumer electronics, wearable devices, semiconductor circuits and high-precision components for market advantage. Founded in 1944, ESI is headquartered in Portland, Oregon, with global operations and subsidiaries in Asia, Europe and North America.
Laser microfabrication is comprised of a set of precise micron-level processes, including drilling, scribing, dicing, singulation, cutting, ablating, trimming, and precision marking on multiple types of materials. These processes require application-specific laser systems that are able to meet our customers’ exacting performance and productivity requirements. Our laser-based systems are utilized in the production of flexible and rigid printed circuit boards (PCB), semiconductor devices, advanced semiconductor packaging, consumer electronics, electronic sensors, touch-panel glass, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), applications within the automotive, aerospace, medical and display end markets as well as other high value components and devices to enable functionality, increase performance and improve production yields.
Additionally, we produce high-capacity test and inspection equipment that is critical to the quality control process during the production of multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs). Our equipment ensures that each component meets the electrical and physical tolerances required to perform properly.
In the second quarter of 2017, ESI acquired Visicon Technologies, Inc. (Visicon), which brings a portfolio of defect detection systems for the medical device and consumer electronics markets to ESI’s current product solutions.
Between the fourth quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2017, we operated in two segments, Component Processing and Micromachining. In the fourth quarter of 2017, based on the recommendation of our new CEO and in light of our efficiency and cost-saving efforts, the Company reorganized into a functional structure. As a result of this reorganization, we no longer have separate business units or separate general managers, and the CEO now allocates resources and evaluates performance on a company-wide basis. We now report as one segment. This single segment sells into a variety of end markets that we group into four major categories: 1) PCB, 2) Semiconductor, 3) Component Test, and 4) Industrial Machining. PCB includes Flex, high density interconnect (HDI), and packaging products targeting this market; Semiconductor includes all wafer-based products; Component Test includes our MLCC products and tooling; and Industrial Machining includes our machining and inspection tools that address a broader market including not just consumer electronics, but also automotive, aerospace, medical, and display end markets. See Note 25 "Product and Geographic Information" for further discussion.

Industry Overview
The PCB, semiconductor and other microelectronics industries are driven by demand for improved functionality in increasingly smaller and smarter consumer devices such as smart phones, tablets, wearable technologies, personal computers, mobile computing devices, video game systems and high-definition televisions. In addition to the consumer markets, semiconductor and other advanced technologies are being used in a broadening set of industrial markets and applications, including automotive, aerospace, medical and display. 
These dynamics in turn are driving the microelectronics supply base for faster, smaller, more complex, less expensive and higher-quality electronic devices and sub-components. To achieve these improvements, manufacturers are forced to increase circuit densities and shrink feature geometries while increasing the interconnect flexibility. This drives our customer base to push the envelope in terms of materials, manufacturing processes, and topologies. 
For example, smaller semiconductor devices are driving the need to shrink the physical dimensions of the semiconductor packages. As the physical dimensions of the package shrink, the ability to physically and electrically connect these devices becomes more challenging. The PCB manufacturers are forced to utilize new techniques such as HDI circuit boards on which connections are made. These HDI circuits require smaller, more accurate, and precisely tapered or shaped holes, known as vias, to create connections between layers and the interconnecting devices. In addition, integrated circuit (IC) designers are moving high level interconnect from the silicon die to the IC package (ICP) to reduce overall cost of the device as well as to improve overall signal integrity in the device. Another example of these trends are in the new display technologies which are driving the need for more complex flexible interconnect circuits. These trends require smaller, more accurate, and precisely tapered or shaped holes, known as vias, to create connections between layers and interconnecting devices. The continual trend toward smaller and smarter devices also requires the use of an increasing amount of flexible interconnect material between PCBs and other components. For example, new display technologies are driving the need for more complex flexible circuits. 
In addition, new materials are being developed to help drive signal integrity improvements, temperature, and physical stability such as porous dielectrics and low-k films. We believe this trend may drive additional applications for laser processing, including scribing of next generation thin films.
Passive components, which do not utilize traditional semiconductor processing, are under the same pressure to improve performance while reducing size. This has resulted in an increase in the use of smaller passive components such as MLCCs. Manufacturers must test MLCCs electrically and optically to characterize performance and ensure reliability. Automated equipment to test these MLCCs in the manufacturing environment, like our high capacitance tester, can test and sort up to one million parts per hour on parts with dimensions as small as 0.4 by 0.2 millimeters.
Our business also includes specialized microfabrication applications. Many materials that can be cut, drilled, marked or joined using a mechanical process can be microfabricated with greater precision and accuracy using a laser-based solution. As consumer electronics and industrial products or devices become more compact, traditional mechanical processes will not be able to meet the stringent specifications demanded by producers. We believe the capabilities of laser-based solutions for microfabrication will enable our customers to continue to move beyond the limitations of mechanical processes and generate growth for us in the future.
Finally, the shrinkage in dimensions and requirement for accuracy in these processes and devices is increasing the need for micron-level inspection and defect detection as either a post-processing step or stand-alone measurement. During the year, we acquired Visicon, a technology leader in high accuracy and high throughput measurement and defect detection systems for the medical device and consumer electronic markets. We believe this technology is complementary to our core competencies, expands our presence in medical and potentially other industrial markets, and is highly leveraged to our existing products.
Our Solutions
We believe our products address the needs of PCB, semiconductor, and other micro-electronics and industrial manufacturers by providing them with a high return on their investment due to measurable production benefits such as lower cost of ownership, higher performance, continued miniaturization, greater reliability, and improved production yield.
Our core competencies enable us to design, manufacture, and market a variety of integrated laser-based solutions for microfabrication applications in high-volume manufacturing environments. These core competencies include a deep understanding of:

• | laser/material interaction;


• | laser beam positioning;


• | optics and illumination including image processing and optical character recognition;


• | micron-level defect detection;

4


• | high-speed motion control;


• | small parts handling;


• | proprietary laser technology including laser power control; and


• | systems engineering.

We combine this expertise with a thorough understanding of our customers’ processes and our manufacturing agility to respond rapidly to customer demand to develop and deliver integrated solutions and products that address multiple markets and applications.
Our customers manufacture components, interconnect/packaging devices, semiconductors, displays or other parts that serve a wide range of electronic applications. Our systems enable the manufacturing of these components and devices. The primary end-market applications for our customers are consumer electronics, including smart mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets, computers and semiconductors. These devices and applications are also utilized in a variety of other industries including automotive, aerospace, medical and display.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to leverage our core competencies to be a cost of ownership leader in laser-based microfabrication for micro-technology industries, including PCB, semiconductor, microelectronics, and other industrial applications including automotive, aerospace, medical and display. These core competencies, combined with an understanding of our customers’ processes and the use of common platforms, enable us to address a broad range of laser-based applications and end markets within these industries. We intend to focus our efforts on businesses and applications where our differentiated capability enables us to be a market leader. The elements of our strategy are to (1) expand our addressable market by focusing on large, existing, near-adjacent applications in the growing laser-microfabrication market, (2) focus on areas where we have differentiated capability, (3) leverage proprietary laser technology to create competitive advantage, (4) strengthen marketing capability and broaden customer focus, (5) develop and leverage flexible platforms and technology for cost of ownership and time to market advantage in new applications and (6) lower breakeven point to increase earnings consistency over time.
Expand our addressable market by focusing on large, existing, near-adjacent applications in the growing laser microfabrication market 
Growth in consumer electronics, smart phones, tablets, notebook computers and other smart devices is driving increased miniaturization and complexity of the underlying components and materials. These materials and components are being adopted in electronic devices, sensors, displays, and other technologies across many markets and industries. As a result, we believe there are many large, existing, near-adjacent opportunities for laser micromachining for both the devices themselves and components within them. Our strategy is to expand our addressable market in these near-adjacent applications where we can utilize our technology for a cost of ownership advantage for our customers. Our primary areas of focus are to defend and grow our presence in PCB and interconnect value-added laser processes, expand our industrial machining product and customer base beyond consumer electronics, and extend the reach of our existing product portfolio. For example, during 2017 we grew our position in flexible circuit manufacturing and introduced new products, capabilities, and price points with the introduction of our Lodestone and Redstone products. We continued to expand applications for Garnet, a flexible mid-range machining system targeted at broad industries beyond consumer electronics, such as defense, aerospace, and medical. We also acquired Visicon, which provides an established product set and customer relationships in the medical device industry. We believe our growth will be driven by overall growth in the market for electronic and other industrial devices, expanding the applications and customers we address, and growing our share in these adjacent markets.
Focus on markets where we can apply our differentiated capability
Following our reorganization this year, we have refocused our strategy to concentrate our efforts on markets where we can leverage our differentiated capability to provide high value to our customers. As a result, we will focus our investments on applications where laser machining adds more functional rather than purely aesthetic value. These capabilities can be applied to a broad set of industrial industries beyond consumer electronics including automotive, aerospace, medical and display. We believe this change is better aligned with our expertise and strengths and will help us better leverage our investments in resources and technology.

Leverage proprietary laser technology to create competitive advantage
ESI is a pioneer in laser-material interaction and has developed deep expertise in the use of multiple types of laser technology to develop customer solutions. We have invested in proprietary laser technology primarily through the acquisitions of Eolite Systems, and PyroPhotonics Lasers. The acquisition of Eolite provided us access to high power ultraviolet (UV) nanosecond and low-cost picosecond fiber lasers with a unique, scalable architecture. Combined with capability from our PyroPhotonics laser business, these lasers address multiple micromachining applications, including thin film processing, glass processing, material trimming, precision drilling, and organic and metal cutting. We intend to continue to utilize these lasers internally to provide differentiated capability and lower cost of ownership as well as provide potential additional commercial revenue for the Company. In 2017, we successfully ramped our Boreas laser, which provided key differentiation for our latest generation flexible drilling product, Gemstone. Our Boreas laser is our largest deployment of internally developed lasers for our own systems to date. Our strategy is to expand the utilization of these technologies to enable differentiated capability within our systems, lower cost, and generate incremental revenue and gross profit for the Company.
Strengthen marketing capability and broaden customer focus
The Company’s close collaboration with key customers who are leaders in their respective industries has enabled ESI to develop world-class technologies that meet the emerging needs of these demanding customers. Our strategy is to modify our approach to product development so we can meet needs across broader markets as opposed to a few key customers. We believe this new approach will enable our products to serve the needs of a far larger portion of the laser microfabrication market. Through our reorganization to a functional structure and recent hiring of Vice Presidents of Marketing and Sales & Service, we believe we will continue to strengthen our marketing capability and channel effectiveness. 
Leverage flexible platforms and technology for cost of ownership and time to market advantage
Our key technological capabilities include laser-material interaction, laser beam positioning, optics and illumination, defect detection, high-speed motion control systems, small parts handling systems and systems integration. Our strategy is to incorporate these capabilities into a series of flexible platforms that have multiple common elements but are tailored to specific applications and to leverage our investment in these platforms to address multiple new applications and market opportunities. In addition, we believe that leveraging common platforms will increase efficiency in the Company through greater use of common parts, lower inventory requirements, shorter cycle times, and leveraged engineering investment across the Company. During 2016, we introduced several new platforms that with minimal modification can address a variety of laser micromachining applications.
Lower breakeven point to increase earnings consistency over time
Our business has historically been highly seasonal resulting in only short periods of profitability. As part of our reorganization plan, we intend to lower our cost structure and operating break-even point to improve overall profitability and increase consistency of earnings over time. As a result, we have closed our sites in Montreal, Canada; Napa, California; and Sunnyvale, California; initiated headcount reductions across all functions and geographies, begun to refocus and reprioritize our investments, and reorganized the Company into a functional, streamlined structure. In addition, we have made several changes to our executive management team. We believe the new functional structure will enable lower cost, increased accountability and improved decision-making capability. We expect this structure to largely be in place by the end of our second fiscal quarter of 2018. 
Our Products
Printed Circuit Board
Our PCB products address multiple applications and materials on a broad set of substrates, panels, and continuous-feed reels primarily for the PCB and packaging industries. Our laser via drilling systems target electrical interconnect applications that require high accuracy and small via (hole) dimensions to create electrical connections between layers in flexible circuits, high-density circuit boards and IC packages. Our micro via drilling technology addresses the rapidly changing applications in IC packages, multichip modules and HDI circuit boards. Our UV laser processing systems employ state-of-the-art technology in lasers, optics and motion control. These products include single-beam and multi-beam systems that produce high-quality vias with the best-in-class placement accuracy for improved yield of packages and substrates.
These same technologies can be used to singulate individual PCBs (depaneling), rout copper openings on PCB material, precisely cut flexible circuit material, and mark individual packages or circuit boards.

Semiconductor
Our semiconductor manufacturing products address multiple applications that utilize laser energy to process materials on wafer-based substrates and semiconductor devices and packages. Applications include processing of silicon wafers, memory devices, mixed signal devices, hybrid circuits, sensors, and resistors.
The advent of 3D chip packaging technologies is driving the need for silicon wafers to become thinner in order to allow for stacking of wafers within the same packaging geometry. As wafers become thinner, they become more challenging to cut into discrete chips using traditional mechanical saws. During 2016 we introduced the UltrusTM platform that can scribe next-generation thin film materials that lend themselves to laser processing. As 3D technologies are developed, we believe the use of advanced laser technology will become increasingly important to productivity and performance.
Our semiconductor manufacturing products also include industry-leading wafer marking equipment, wafer and circuit trim tools, and LCD repair tools. Wafer marking equipment is used for serialization and wafer identification by both manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and within semiconductor factories. Wafer and circuit trim tools are laser systems that adjust the electrical performance of semiconductor devices or hybrid circuits by removing a precise amount of material from one or more circuit components. In addition, the Company continues to sell a limited number of memory yield improvement systems and related laser upgrades.
Our laser display repair systems are utilized to improve yields in the manufacture of flat panel displays. During production, individual pixels of a display may develop electrical defects that result in no light emission or the emission of only a steady white light. To correct these defects, flat panel display producers employ a laser repair process to isolate the electrical defects during production by cutting the inputs to the pixel. Our laser systems are primarily sold to the manufacturers of LCD and organic light emitting diode (OLED) repair tools as a key component of their products.
Component Test 
Our component test products combine high-speed small parts handling technology with real-time control systems to provide highly automated, cost-effective inspection solutions for manufacturers of MLCCs and other passive components such as capacitor arrays, inductors, resistors, varistors and hybrid circuits. These components, produced in quantities of trillions of units per year, process analog, digital and high-frequency signals and are used extensively in nearly all electronic products. Our MLCC test systems employ high-speed handling and positioning techniques to precisely load, test and sort MLCCs based on their electrical energy storage capacity, or capacitance, and their electrical energy leakage, or dissipation factor. Our 35XX series is the most productive tester in the market today. Our latest AllegroTM model enables high-speed testing of the industry’s smallest metric 0402 capacitors used primarily in advanced cell phone and tablet designs. We also produce consumable products such as carrier plates and termination belts, both of which are used to hold MLCCs during the manufacturing and testing process.
Industrial Machining 
Industrial machining products are comprised of laser systems that are used primarily by manufacturers of end devices across multiple industries to drill, cut or mark features on a variety of materials, generally on the casing or external surface of the end device. In addition, industrial machining products tend to serve markets that require fewer features, less stringent design requirements, and lower cost.
We offer several platforms that enable customers to perform precision drilling, scribing, cutting, etching, routing or marking on many different types of materials and devices including glass, metal, plastic, paint and ceramics. We also offer laser products for integration into customers' tools or processes that are useful for applications such as thin film processing, glass processing, material trimming, precision drilling, and organic and metal cutting.
In 2017, we acquired Visicon, a leading supplier of high-accuracy and high-throughput measurement and defect detection systems based in Napa, California. Visicon brings a strong portfolio of stand-alone defect detection systems for the medical device and consumer electronics markets. We believe this business provides complementary technology, expands our presence into the medical device market, and is highly leverageable into our consumer electronics customer base.
In addition, we offer laser ablation systems that ablate material for identification and analysis applications, including forensics, mineral analysis and research.

Customers
Our top ten customers for 2017, 2016 and 2015 accounted for approximately 47%, 51% and 40% of total net sales, respectively. Two customers, Sumitomo Corporation and Zhen Ding Technologies accounted for approximately 12% and 11%, respectively in 2017. One customer, Apple Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 15% in 2016. No single customer had more than 10% of net sales in 2015. 
Sales, Marketing and Service
We sell our products worldwide through direct sales and service offices, value-added resellers and independent representatives located around the world. ESI has direct sales and service personnel in Oregon, California and several other states; China, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan in Asia; and France, Germany and the United Kingdom in Europe. We serve select customers in Asia, the Americas, Europe and additional countries through manufacturers’ representatives.
We have a substantial base of installed products in use by leading PCB, semiconductor, and microelectronics manufacturers. We emphasize strong working relationships with these customers to meet their needs for additional systems and to facilitate the successful development and sale of new products to these customers. 
We generally employ service personnel wherever we have a significant installed base. We offer a variety of warranty, maintenance and parts replacement programs to support the requirements of our customers’ high-volume manufacturing environments.
Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in the first half of the calendar year due in part to customers adding capacity in advance of seasonal holiday demand for electronic products. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.
Backlog
Backlog consists of purchase orders for products and spare parts that we expect to ship within the next 12 months and service contracts for performance generally within the next 24 months. Backlog does not include deferred system revenue. Backlog was $69.5 million at April 1, 2017 compared to $55.2 million at April 2, 2016, representing an increase of 26% primarily as a result of increased orders in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Our backlog is not necessarily indicative of sales for any specific future period, because of possible order cancellations or deferrals, shipping or acceptance delays, and backlog does not represent any assurance that we will realize a profit from filling the orders.
Research, Development and Technology
We believe that our ability to compete effectively and deliver customer solutions depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and expand our expertise in core technologies and product applications. Our primary core competencies and capabilities include:

• | laser/material interaction;


• | laser beam positioning;


• | optics and illumination including image processing and optical character recognition;


• | micron-level defect detection;


• | high-speed motion control;


• | small parts handling;


• | proprietary laser technology including laser power control; and


• | systems engineering.

We spend a considerable amount of our net sales proceeds to maintain and expand our expertise in core technologies and product applications. Our research and development expenditures for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $31.7 million (20% of net sales), $32.4 million (18% of net sales) and $35.2 million (22% of net sales), respectively. We conduct our focused research and development efforts in our three-building complex in Portland, Oregon.

Competition
Our markets are dynamic, cyclical and highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in our markets are total cost of ownership, product performance, ease of use, reliability, service, technical support, product roadmap, price, proprietary technology, manufacturing responsiveness and relationships with customers. We believe that our products compete favorably with respect to these factors. Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering and manufacturing resources and larger distribution networks than we do. Some of our customers or potential customers develop, or have the ability to develop, manufacturing equipment similar to our products. Competition in our markets may intensify and our technological advantages may be reduced or lost as a result of technological advances by competitors or customers or changes in electronic device processing technology.
Our PCB processing products primarily compete with laser systems provided by Via Mechanics, Ltd., EO Technics Co. Ltd., LPKF Laser & Electronics AG, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, and Orbotech Ltd. Our semiconductor products primarily compete with InnoLas Systems GmbH and DISCO Corporation. Our component test products primarily compete with Laser Solutions, Inc., Quantel USA, Inc., HOYA Corporation, and Humo Laboratory Ltd. as well as component manufacturers that develop systems for internal use. Our industrial machining products primarily compete with laser systems provided by Han's Laser Technology Industry Group Co Ltd., HG Laser, and several Chinese and Korean companies who compete within their local markets. Our defect detection products primarily compete against providers of optical measuring machines such as Micro-Vu Corporation, OGP, and Werth, Inc., and systems integrators such as GDO and IMS Technology Services.
Manufacturing and Supply
Our primary production facilities are located in Singapore; Portland, Oregon; Klamath Falls, Oregon; and Wuhan, China. Our Singapore facility is our primary systems manufacturing facility and manufactures the vast majority of our systems and lasers. The Portland facility primarily provides advanced manufacturing and prototype capability. The Klamath Falls facility manufactures component test consumable products. The Wuhan facility is primarily used to manufacture our lower cost industrial machining products. Our Singapore and Wuhan operations are located in leased facilities. As we continue our efforts to streamline the organization and improve efficiencies, we expect a growing percentage of final systems will be shipped from Singapore and China. 
We use qualified manufacturers to supply many components and sub-system modules for our products. Our systems use high-performance computers, peripherals, lasers and other components from various suppliers. Some of the components we use are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers. An interruption in the supply of a particular component would have a temporary adverse impact on us. We believe our relationships with our suppliers are good.
Patents and Other Intellectual Property
We have a policy of seeking patents, when appropriate, on inventions relating to products and methods that are discovered or developed as part of our ongoing research, development and manufacturing activities. We owned 405 United States patents and 1,109 patents issued outside of the United States as of April 1, 2017. Additionally, as of April 1, 2017, we had 73 patent applications pending in the United States and 252 patent applications pending outside of the United States. Although our patents are important, we believe that the competitiveness of our products also depends on the technical competence and innovation of our employees.
We rely on copyright protection for our proprietary software. We also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, and we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. 
Employees
As of April 1, 2017, we employed 720 people of whom 683 were permanent and 37 were temporary. Many of our employees are highly skilled, and our success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees, who are in great demand. We have never had a work stoppage or strike, and no employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Environmental Compliance
We do not expect compliance with international, federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted related to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or ability to compete in the marketplace.
