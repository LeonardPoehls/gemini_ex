ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
GENERAL
 
 Powin Energy Corporation (“Company”, “we”, “us”) is a leading designer and developer of safe and scalable energy storage solutions for utilities, microgrid, and EV fast-charging stations. The Company was founded in 1989 in Oregon and until 2016, operated as a contract manufacturer selling diverse products for leading North American retailers. In 2016, the Company sold off its contract manufacturing businesses, and on October 6, 2016, completed a merger between Powin Corporation and its subsidiary Powin Energy Corporation, with the surviving entity Powin Corporation changing its name to Powin Energy Corporation. The Company is focused on the rapidly growing advanced energy storage industry, supported by its patented Battery Pack Operating System (bp-OS).
Competition
 
The international market for such energy products and services is intensely competitive and continually impacted by evolving industry standards, international and regional governmental regulations, rapid price changes and product obsolescence. Competitors in this market include many domestic and foreign companies, most of which have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, manufacturing and other resources.   We are and will continue to be at a competitive disadvantage to most of our competitors, though patented architecture provides strong round trip efficiency (RTE) with an industry competitive price in all of its energy segments.
LEGAL ENTITIES AND OPERATING SEGMENTS
 
During the periods presented, we operated in six business segments, each within a separate legal entity. During 2015 and 2016, several segments were renamed to more accurately reflect the nature of operations. Where applicable, the legal entities were also renamed to correspond to the segment name. Below is a table listing the legal entities presented in this report, along with the corresponding business segment names and, for the purposes of continuity, the legal entity and segment names as disclosed in our previous filings:
