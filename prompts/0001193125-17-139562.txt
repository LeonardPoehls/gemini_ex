--------+---------

OVERVIEW 
 Red Hat is a leading global provider of open source software solutions, using a community-powered approach to develop and offer reliable and high-performing operating system, virtualization, management, middleware, cloud, mobile and storage technologies. 
 Our business model 
 Development. We employ an open source development model. The open source development model allows us to use the collective input, resources and knowledge of a global community of contributors who can collaborate to develop, maintain and enhance software because the human-readable source code for that software is publicly available and licenses permit modification.
Licensing. We typically distribute our software offerings under open source licenses that permit access to the softwares human-readable source code.
Subscriptions. We provide our software offerings primarily under annual or multi-year subscriptions as well as on-demand through our certified cloud and service providers (CCSPs).
Our offerings 
 Our offerings are designed to provide customers with high-performing, scalable, flexible, reliable and secure infrastructure technologies that meet the information technology (IT) needs of enterprises and service providers. Our offerings enable our customers to optimize their IT environments to increase agility and flexibility

 Development and licensing of Red Hats open source offerings 
 The open source software development model allows us to use the collective input, resources and knowledge of a global community of contributors who collaborate to develop, maintain and enhance software. We believe this model offers advantages to Red Hat because we are able to develop our offerings by integrating information and knowledge from this global community. We develop our offerings by working with open source development communities, often in a leadership role. Red Hat sponsors a number of open source communities, including the CentOS project, the Ceph community project, the Fedora Project, GlusterFS, the JBoss community projects and OpenShift Origin. We are also an active contributor in other communities such as Apache Camel, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Kubernetes, the Linux kernel, the Open Container Initiative, the OpenDaylight Project, Open Platform for NFV and OpenStack. Our role helps us to benefit from the efforts of these communities, which we believe enhances acceptance and support of our offerings and technologies. Additionally, the open and transparent nature of these communities provides our customers and potential customers, who may also be part of these open source communities, with access and insights into, and the ability to influence, the future direction of our offerings. 
 Under the open source licensing model, a software developer distributes the software under an open source license, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL), GNU Lesser General Public License or Apache License. Open source licenses provide relatively broad rights for recipients of the software to use, copy, modify and redistribute the software. These rights afford significant latitude for recipients to inspect, suggest changes to, customize or enhance the software. 
 The open source model provides an inherent level of transparency and choice that contrasts with the proprietary software model. Under the proprietary software model, a software vendor generally develops the software itself or acquires components from other vendors, without the input from a wider community of participants. The vendor generally licenses to the user only the machine-readable binary (or object) code version of the software, with no or limited rights to copy, modify or redistribute the software, and does not make the underlying source code available to the user or other developers. Moreover, peer review and collaborative enhancements are more difficult because of the lack of access to the source code. 
 The scale and efficiency of open source software development has greatly increased through the availability of collaborative technologies and cloud-based tools, such as email lists, websites and code repositories. These technologies have enabled a global community of developers to collaborate on more complex open source projects, many of which are commercially funded. 
 We believe that open source software is a viable and arguably superior alternative to traditional proprietary software. Open source software, as compared to proprietary software, offers a number of benefits to customers, including: 
 

 | enabling a customers in-house development team to collaborate and innovate with a global community of independent developers and testers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | providing a customers in-house development team access to both binary and source code, and broader rights to copy, modify and redistribute the software;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | offering a customer greater flexibility through open rather than proprietary protocols and formats;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | enabling ongoing, quicker access to improvements and fixes; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | allowing a customer to inspect and help diagnose problems more easily and customize the software to suit its particular needs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Subscription business model 
 We provide our software offerings to our customers primarily under annual or multi-year subscriptions as well as on-demand through CCSPs. Our subscription business model is designed to provide customers with a 
 
5 
 
Index to Financial Statements
  comprehensive technology solution for the duration of their subscription. A subscription generally entitles a customer to, among other things, a specified level of support, as well as security updates, fixes, functionality enhancements, upgrades to the technologies, each if and when available, and compatibility with an ecosystem of certified hardware and software. A subscription also includes access to the Red Hat Customer Portal, which provides customers with services such as our knowledge base, product usage documentation and account management tools. We offer customers subscription options that provide varying levels of customer support. In addition, our customers are eligible to participate in Red Hats Open Source Assurance program, which provides certain protections in the event of an intellectual property infringement claim based on our offerings. 
 Our subscription business model contrasts with the typical proprietary software license model from a revenue recognition perspective. Under a proprietary software license model, the vendor typically recognizes license revenue in the period that the software is initially licensed. In contrast, under our subscription model, we generally defer revenue when we bill the customer and recognize revenue over the life of the subscription term. 
 Distribution of Red Hat offerings 
 We make Red Hat offerings available directly to customers and indirectly through various channels of distribution. Our direct sales channels include our sales force and our web store. Our indirect sales channels include CCSPs (such as public cloud providers and managed service providers), distributors, embedded technology partners, independent software vendors (ISVs), systems integrators (SIs) and value added resellers (VARs). In addition, hardware original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) pre-load and support Red Hat offerings on their hardware products and sell their hardware together with Red Hat offerings as part of pre-configured solutions. 
 With the support and tools we make available, many of these companies have engineered and certified that their technologies run on or with Red Hat offerings, and, in some cases, independent hardware vendors (IHVs) and ISVs have built their products and solutions using our offerings. Our offerings can also be used on an on-demand basis through our CCSPs, allowing our customers to utilize their subscriptions with increased flexibility. We believe widespread support from these companies helps to increase the level of market acceptance and adoption of our offerings. 
 Support by leading technology providers 
 To facilitate the widespread deployment of Red Hat offerings, we have focused on gaining broad support for our offerings from technology providers that are critical to enterprises. For example, leading ISVs with applications that run on, or with, our technologies include BMC Software, Inc. (BMC), CA, Inc. (CA), Cerner Corporation (Cerner), EMC Corporation (EMC), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE), International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Oracle Corporation (Oracle), SAP SE (SAP), SAS Institute Inc. (SAS), Symantec Corporation (Symantec) and VMware, Inc. (VMware). In addition, we have certification and pre-load arrangements with leading hardware vendors including Cisco Systems, Inc. (Cisco), Dell Inc. (Dell), Fujitsu Limited (Fujitsu), HPE, Hitachi, Ltd (Hitachi), IBM, Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo), and NEC Corporation (NEC). We also have certification agreements with leading networking, storage and telecommunication companies including Big Switch Networks, Inc., Cisco, EMC, Ericsson Inc., F5 Networks, Inc., HPE, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Juniper Networks, Inc., NetApp, Inc. (NetApp) and Nokia Corporation. We have strategic relationships with leading semiconductor and technology companies, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., ARM Holdings plc, Dell, Intel Corporation and IBM, and CCSPs, such as Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon), Fujitsu, Google Inc. (Google), IBM, Microsoft and Rackspace Hosting, Inc. We also have relationships with a number of global SIs such as Accenture plc (Accenture), Atos SE, Computer Sciences Corporation, HPE, IBM, Tata Consultancy Services Limited (TCS), Tech Mahindra Limited and Wipro Limited.

Red Hat has three geographic operating segments: the Americas (U.S., Canada and Latin America), EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific. These segments are aggregated into one reportable segment due to the similarity in the nature of offerings, financial performance, economic characteristics (e.g., revenue growth and gross margin), methods of production and distribution and customer classes (e.g., CCSPs, distributors, resellers and enterprise). See NOTE 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and NOTE 19Segment Reporting to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our operating segments. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a discussion of some of the risks attendant to our operations, including foreign operations. 
 Subscription revenue by product group 
 Subscription revenue for our Infrastructure-related offerings (Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat Satellite, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization and related offerings) as a percentage of our total revenue were 70.3%, 72.1% and 74.0% for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. Subscription revenue for our Application Development-related offerings (Red Hat JBoss Middleware) and other emerging technology offerings (including our cloud offerings, Red Hat Mobile Application Platform and Red Hat Storage) as a percentage of our total revenue were 18.2%, 15.7% and 13.2% for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. For additional financial information about our products and services, see NOTE 19Segment Reporting to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Customers 
 We sell our offerings to enterprises in a variety of industries, including financial services, government, healthcare, retail, technology and media, telecommunications and transportation. For fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, 
 
7 
 
Index to Financial Statements
  the U.S. government and its agencies represented in the aggregate approximately 10% of our total revenue. For fiscal 2015, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. 
Backlog 
 We define total backlog as the value of non-cancellable subscription and service agreements, including total deferred revenue, which is billed, plus the value of non-cancellable subscription and service agreements to be billed in the future and not reflected in our financial statements. The value of non-cancellable subscription and service agreements at February 28, 2017 included deferred revenue classified as a current liability of $1.51 billion and long-term deferred revenue of $557.2 million. The value of non-cancellable subscription and service agreements to be billed in the future and not reflected in our financial statements is in excess of $650.0 million. The portion of total backlog at February 28, 2017 that we expect to be billed during the fiscal year ending February 28, 2018 is in excess of $330.0 million. At February 29, 2016, the value of non-cancellable subscription and service agreements included deferred revenue classified as a current liability of $1.27 billion and long-term deferred revenue of $449.6 million. The value of non-cancellable subscription and service agreements to be billed in the future and not reflected in our financial statements at February 29, 2016 was in excess of $410.0 million. 
 We report our off-balance sheet backlog as a conservative approximation, often describing the amount as in excess of, primarily because the value of underlying contracts is derived from data not yet subjected to the complete application of our revenue recognition policies. We endeavor to derive the value of our off-balance sheet backlog in a consistent manner year over year and therefore believe the amounts are comparable. 
 Seasonality 
 Our fourth fiscal quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for billing both new business and renewals. For a more detailed discussion, see Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

 With respect to our operating system offerings, our competitors include Microsoft, which offers a hardware-independent, multi-user operating system that competes with Red Hats offerings. Moreover, we also compete with HPE, IBM, Oracle and Unisys Corporation, each of which offers the UNIX operating system. Many of these competitors bundle competitive operating systems, such as UNIX, with their own hardware and additional software offerings, thereby making it more difficult for us to penetrate their customer bases. With respect to Linux operating systems, our competitors include Micro Focus International plc, with its SUSE brand of Linux, and Amazons and Oracles Linux offerings. We also compete with freely available Linux distributions, such as CentOS, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE and Ubuntu. 
 With respect to our virtualization offerings, our competitors include Microsoft, Oracle and VMware. Microsoft and VMware offer virtualization technologies that are certified and supported with Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system offerings, and Microsoft supports its server operating systems and application servers running on our virtualization offerings. 
 With respect to our middleware offerings, our competitors include IBM, Microsoft, MuleSoft, Inc., Oracle and Pivotal Software, Inc. (Pivotal). Most of these vendors offer the majority of their middleware products under a typical proprietary software license model. IBM and Oracle often bundle hardware and software for their customers, making it more difficult for us to penetrate their customer bases. Our middleware offerings are heavily dependent on the Java computing platform, which is controlled by Oracle. 
 With respect to our cloud technologies, we compete with companies that provide tools for enterprises to create private clouds, such as HPE, Microsoft, Mirantis Inc., Oracle, Pivotal and VMware, companies that

  provide platform as a service offerings, such as IBM, Oracle, Pivotal and SAP, and companies that provide public clouds with, and that allow users to consume, computing resources as a service without the need to purchase equipment or software, such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft. 
 With respect to our mobile offerings, our competitors include IBM, Oracle, salesforce.com, inc. (Salesforce) and SAP as well as more mobile-focused companies such as AnyPresence, Inc., Kinvey, Inc. and Kony, Inc. Increasingly, cloud service providers are also offering mobile development services as part of their enterprise cloud offerings. 
 With respect to our storage offerings, we compete with companies that provide storage products, such as EMC and NetApp. Public cloud service providers, such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft, also offer storage capabilities. 
 With respect to our service offerings, we face competition in the markets for services related to the development, deployment and integration of enterprise technologies. Our competitors in these markets include Accenture, HPE, IBM and TCS, as well as other technology consulting companies. 
 Due to the nature of open source technology, the open source software model is not characterized by the traditional barriers to entry that are found in the proprietary software model. For example, the financial and legal barriers to creating a new Linux distribution are relatively low because the software components typically included in Linux distributions are publicly available under open source licenses that permit copying, modification and redistribution. Anyone can use, copy, modify and redistribute Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat JBoss Middleware and our other open source offerings. However, they are not permitted to refer to these products as Red Hat or Red Hat JBoss products unless they have a formal business relationship with us that allows for such references. Moreover, our customers agree that during their support relationship with Red Hat, they will purchase a support subscription based on the number of computer systems, cores, sockets or other units on which they deploy Red Hats software. In addition, the primary means by which customers can receive Red Hat software, as well as security updates, fixes, functionality enhancements and upgrades to the technologies, each if and when available, is to purchase and maintain a current subscription directly from us or our partners with whom we have agreements. 
 There are significantly more enterprise applications available for competing operating systems technologies, such as Windows, than there are for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. An integral part of our strategy has been to help address these shortcomings by, among other methods, strengthening our existing strategic and channel partner relationships and entering into new ones to expand our marketing and distribution capabilities and by attracting more attention to the open source movement. Also, increasing the adoption of Red Hat technologies as well as the .Net infrastructure becoming available to the open source community can create additional opportunities and incentives for software developers to write more applications that are compatible with Red Hat technologies. 
 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENT 
 We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in research and development. We expended $480.7 million, $413.3 million and $367.9 million in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively, in research and development costs. We focus and modify our research and development efforts based on our business strategy, the needs of users and changes in the marketplace. Our development efforts are currently focused on adding new or improved functionality to our offerings that is needed by customers or that supports the expansion of our third-party hardware and software ecosystem. However, any upgrades and enhancements are offered on an if-and-when-available basis. Red Hat is also investing in developing new software offerings and enabling new forms of development that are aimed at customers who seek hybrid, private and public cloud computing solutions. Our software engineers collaborate with open source software development teams working through open source communities, such as Apache Camel, the CentOS project, the 
 
15 
 
Index to Financial Statements
  Ceph community project, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, the Fedora Project, GlusterFS, the JBoss community projects, Kubernetes, the Linux kernel, the Open Container Initiative, the OpenDaylight Project, Open Platform for NFV, OpenShift Origin and OpenStack. This involvement enables us to remain abreast of, and in some instances lead, certain technical advances, plans for development of new features and timing of releases, as well as other information related to the management of open source projects. 
 Our software engineers make development contributions to many components comprising Red Hat software offerings and provide leadership within the various open source communities across many of the core components. Our software engineers also perform extensive testing of Red Hat technologies. We use various industry recognized methods of quality assurance testing to seek to ensure that our technologies are ready for use by our customers when delivered. We also work closely with leading hardware and software vendors to seek to ensure that their hardware and applications will operate effectively with Red Hat platforms. 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 Our offerings, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat JBoss Middleware, are built primarily from software components licensed under various open source licenses. While some components are developed by our employees, Red Hat obtains many components from software developed and released by contributors to independent open source software development projects. Open source licenses grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy, modify and redistribute the software. Certain open source licenses, such as the GPL, impose significant limits on a distributors ability to license derivative works under more restrictive terms and generally require the distributor to disclose the source code of such works. The inclusion of software components governed by such licenses in our offerings limits our ability to use traditional proprietary software licensing models for those offerings. As a result, while we have substantial copyright interests in our software technologies, open source development and licensing practices may have the effect of limiting the value of our software copyright assets. Consequently, our trademarks may represent our most valuable intellectual property. 
 We pursue registration of some of our trademarks in the U.S. and in other countries. We have registered the Red Hat and JBoss trademarks and the Red Hat Shadowman logo in countries in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa as well as in Australia. 
 Despite our efforts to protect our trademark rights, unauthorized third parties have, in the past, attempted and, in the future, may attempt, to misappropriate our trademark rights. We cannot be certain that we will succeed in preventing such misappropriation of our trade names and trademarks. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect or deter misappropriation of our trademark rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. In addition, while we engage in certain enforcement activity, policing unauthorized use of our trademark rights is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and our efforts may be inadequate. The loss of any material trademark or trade name could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 Red Hat also seeks patent protection for some of the innovative ideas of our software developers and other employees. Some of these inventions are applicable to our current technologies, while others provide protection to new and other technologies. Moreover, our principal objectives in seeking patent protection are to provide a measure of deterrence against the potential patent infringement claims of third parties and to a more limited extent to help ensure that new technologies and innovations covered by our patents remain open. As part of Red Hats commitment to the open source community, we provide our Patent Promise, an undertaking, subject to certain limitations, not to enforce our patent rights against users of open source software covered by certain open source licenses. This permits the development and distribution of open source applications by third parties that could otherwise infringe on our patents. For these reasons, it is unlikely that our patents will, of themselves, provide us substantial revenue.

 Third parties have, in the past, asserted and, in the future, may assert, infringement claims against us which may result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license to third-party intellectual property rights. See Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings. There can be no assurance that such licenses will be available on reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Red Hat regularly commits to its subscription customers that if portions of our offerings are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights we will, at our expense and option: obtain the right for the customer to continue to use the technology consistent with their subscription agreement with us; modify the technology so that its use is non-infringing; or replace the infringing component with a non-infringing component, and defend them against specified infringement claims. Although we cannot predict whether we will need to satisfy these commitments and we often have limitations on these commitments, satisfying these commitments could be costly, be time-consuming, divert the attention of technical and management personnel, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 
 We also generally enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to and distribution of our confidential documentation and other proprietary information.
