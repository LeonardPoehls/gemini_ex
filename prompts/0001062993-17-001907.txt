ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview of Our Business
We are a holding company that only operates through our indirect Chinese subsidiaries Beijing SOD and Chongqing SOD. Through our Chinese subsidiaries, we develop, manufacture and market our SOD products in China. SOD is a naturally occurring enzyme which may act as a potent antioxidant defense in cells that are exposed to oxygen. Certain research has shown that under certain biological conditions, SOD revitalizes cells and reduces the rate of cell destruction. It neutralizes the most common free radicalsuperoxide radicalby converting it into hydrogen peroxide and water. Because superoxide is harmful to human cells, and certain forms of SOD exist naturally in most humans, many studies show that SOD is valuable in protecting human cells from the harmful effects of superoxide. SOD is thought to be more powerful than antioxidant vitamins as it activates the body's productions of its own antioxidants. As a result, SOD is referred to as the enzyme of life. Commercially, SOD has a wide range of applications and is widely applied in foods, drinks, skin care productions, pharmaceuticals, to combat ailments ranging from sunburn to rheumatoid arthritis. 
History and Corporate Structure
 We are a New York corporation that was incorporated on February 29, 1996, as United Network Technologies, Inc. and we changed our name to Panagra International Corporation on October 2, 1998. From our inception until 2001, we were relatively inactive with limited operations. On August 2, 2001 we changed our name to Minghua Group International Holdings Limited and at that time we also increased the authorized common shares of our common stock from 40,000,000 shares to 200,000,000 shares. On October 16, 2007, we effectuated a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of all our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, or the Reverse Split, and changed our name to China Longyi Group International Holdings Limited. 
 The following chart reflects our organizational structure as of the date of this report.

Our Industry 
 The health supplements industry in China is currently made up of many small- and medium-sized companies that manufacture and distribute products generally intended to, or marketed for the purpose of maintaining, and sometimes improving, the bodys health and general well being. China is one of the fastest growing health supplements markets in the world. With rapid economic growth and continued improvement of its peoples livelihoods, the demand for health supplements from Chinas 1.4 billion people has expanded tremendously over the last 20 years. Today the Chinese health supplements industry is estimated to be worth approximately $6 billion in annual sales, according to the China Health Care Association, which is an association attached to China's Ministry of Health. Given Chinas current annual per capita consumption of health supplements is approximately $10which is far below that of many western countries.

Ever since American scientists Joe McCord and Irwin Fridovich discovered SOD in cattle erythrocytes in 1969 and hypothesized that it can protect life molecules from oxygenation and retrogradation, experts in the fields of biology and medicine and many entrepreneurs and industrialists have been engaged in research, study, development, application and transformation of SOD into products that we believe will provide human beings with certain health and longevity benefits. 
 Research into the functions and applications of SOD in China began in the late 1970s. Since then, various centers of research in China, including universities, the military and private companies, have researched food, medicinal, and cosmetic applications for SOD. In the 1990s, SOD foods began to be sold in China, including SOD soy milk, SOD dairy milk, and SOD beer. Due to technical problems with these first-generation SOD food products and limited public knowledge of the health benefits of SOD, many were discontinued. Technical difficulties relating to the commercialization of SOD products in China have included: (1) lack of methods for efficient harvesting of SOD from animal and human blood and plants; (2) problems with the maintenance and stabilization of harvested SOD, the longest shelf life so far being only two years in China; and (3) technical problems in the effectiveness of SOD in products, particularly food and other products to be consumed orally. More recently, however, various SOD food products have reappeared in China, including SOD milk, SOD wine, and SOD vegetables and fruits. We believe that these and other types of SOD products will become extremely popular due in part to innovations in the SOD industry; recognition of SOD technologies as proprietary intellectual property; government policies encouraging healthier food; the higher awareness of consumers in China of the health benefits of consuming products containing SOD; and the growth of the spending power of Chinese citizens. 
 In addition, China Science and Technology Institute has recognized that SOD product technologies are proprietary intellectual property. SOD companies, including us, have instituted strict measures to protect their SOD product technologies from being misappropriated. As such, the SOD product technologies may be protected by Chinese intellectual property law even if they are not patented. As a result, companies are encouraged to develop and commercialize SOD technologies. 
 The growing wealth of the Chinese public and its related greater interest in better health and nutrition are also trends in SOD industrys favor. SOD production and distribution companies have been working hard to develop innovations to best exploit the commercial potential of SOD, including our subsidiary, Chongqing SOD. Since 1993, various types of SOD products have been sold in China, such as Beijing Dabao SOD skin care series, Wuhan Jiutouniao SOD liquid nutrition drink series, Guizhou Laolaifu SOD liquid nutrition drink series, Zhejiang SOD beer, SOD toothpaste, SOD soy milk. We believe that the SOD industry in China should expand as Chinese consumers grow more able and willing to purchase SOD products. 
 Our Products
 Historically we manufactured one product, which was Jiuzhou SOD plant wine which we marketed under the name Jiuzhou Holy Wine. Our Jiuzhou SOD plant wine was a product developed from the zymolysis of natural wide berries with an alcohol level of 21%. We currently produce and sell SOD Lifeblood, the mixture of SOD and Enzymes (natural plant extract essence) as an antioxidant. Our SOD Lifeblood is an important source of SOD, vitamins and trace elements, all the raw materials of which are extracted from the wild plants and fruits grown on the mountains at elevations between 1,000 and 4,000 meters in south and southwest China. Our SOD Lifeblood is particularly rich in amino acids, several trace elements and Vitamin C, E, D, B1, B2, B12 and A. It is believed that the product is also an excellent source of polysaccharides, flavonoids, glycosides, phenolics, lysozyme, polyphenols, allicin and monophosphate. All of the raw materials of our fruit enzyme are extracted from the wild plants and fruits of the south Taihang Mountain with at least 3-5 years brewing. The fruit sugars are converted into enzymes with two procedures of anaerobic fermentation and aerobic fermentation without additives. In 2008, we received the certificate of China Spark Program issued by the Ministry of National Science and Technology for our SOD Lifeblood. Our SOD Lifeblood also passed the cordial test conducted by National Sports Bureau in 2014.
Sales & Marketing Strategy 
 Our sales and marketing department currently consists of 8 employees. We are developing a diversified sales network which allows us to effectively market products and services to our customers. In addition to sales efforts conducted directly by our internal sales team and other employees, we also use sales agents. Currently we have 15 sales agents selling our products. 
 In terms of geographic area, our sales network covers 21 cities in China. Our SOD Lifeblood has been listed on the governmental procurement list of Chongqing City, which will grant us a priority to sell our SOD products to various governmental agencies in Chongqing City. We also expect that our SOD products will be listed on the governmental procurement list of Beijing City. We plan to expand our sales network to cover more Chinese cities, including Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Shanghai, Shijiazhuang, Lhasa and Nanchang.

We also plan to employ an online order system, which will cover four major metropolitan areas, such as Beijing, Chengdu, Kunming and Chongqing, within the next 12 months. Through our website http://www.jiuzhoushengjiu.com/index.asp, we will be able to offer a complete line of our products to our customers 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This additional sales channel will enable us to market and sell our products in regions where we do not have retail operations or have limited operations.
 Competition
 The health supplementary business both within China and globally is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. Many of our competitors, both domestic and international, have significant research and development capabilities and financial, scientific, manufacturing, marketing and sales resources. Although our marketing and sales efforts of SOD products are very limited, we believe that we will compete with our competitors based upon the price and quality of our products, ability to produce a diverse range of products and customer services. 
In China, we compete principally with Chengdu New Asia Bioengineering Co., Ltd., Zhuhai Zixing Biological Engineering Co., Ltd. and Liaoyuan Jinchang Bioengineering Co., Ltd. 
 We believe that our SOD Lifeblood, made from more than 10 kinds of wild plants, is more efficient to remove superoxide free radicals than SOD liquid products made by our competitors. In addition, we believe that our SOD plant compound enzyme can be stored under the normal atmospheric temperature for more than 10 years, much longer than the life span of many other SOD products made from animal blood or a single plant. 
Intellectual Property
 In 2009 we registered patent relating to our SOD Lifeblood products. Furthermore, we have registered a trademark for our SOD products which we sell under the name Longyi Lifeblood. 
 In addition, we protect our know how technologies through confidentiality agreements we entered into with our employees in our production department.
 Research and Development
 We did not incur expenditures for research and development for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 Regulation
 Based on different potential uses, SOD products in China are classified into three types under the Chinese law and accordingly are subject to different Chinese laws and regulations. 
 If the SOD products are sold for manufacturing food, they are considered as food additives. Under current Chinese law, a company may not produce SOD products for food additives use without two licenses, the Food Hygiene License issued by the provincial Administration of Health, or AOH, and the Food Production License issued by the provincial Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, or AQSIQ. If the SOD products are sold as raw materials for drugs, the Company should first obtain the Pharmaceutical Producer License from the provincial AOH and the approval from the provincial Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. 
 We have already obtained both the Food Hygiene License issued by the Chongqing AOH and the Food Production License issued by the local AQSIQ. Since we also plan to produce and sell SOD medicines and skin care products, we plan to apply for the Pharmaceutical Producer License from the provincial AOH and the approval from the provincial FDA. 
 In addition, we are also subject to PRCs foreign currency regulations. The PRC government has control over RMB reserves through, among other things, direct regulation of the conversion or RMB into other foreign currencies. Although foreign currencies which are required for current account transactions can be bought freely at authorized Chinese banks, the proper procedural requirements prescribed by Chinese law must be met. At the same time, Chinese companies are also required to sell their foreign exchange earnings to authorized Chinese banks and the purchase of foreign currencies for capital account transactions still requires prior approval of the Chinese government.

 We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. The remuneration payable to employees includes basic salaries and allowances. We have not experienced any significant problems or disruption to our operations due to labor disputes, nor have we experienced any difficulties in recruitment and retention of experienced staff. 
 As required by applicable Chinese laws, we have entered into employment contracts with all of our officers, managers and employees. 
 Our employees in China participate in a state pension scheme organized by Chinese municipal and provincial governments. We are required to contribute to the scheme at a rate of 28% of the average monthly salary. In addition, we are required by Chinese laws to cover employees in China with various types of social insurance. We have purchased social insurances for all of our employees.
