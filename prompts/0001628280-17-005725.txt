Sales Channels
We sell our semiconductor products through three channels: direct sales to OEMs and EMS providers, consignment sales to OEMs and EMSs, and sales through distributors.  Direct sales are managed mainly through our internal sales force and independent sales representatives.  Revenue is recognized on direct sales based on the relevant shipping terms. During fiscal 2017, direct sales accounted for approximately 45% of our total worldwide revenues.
Consignment sales relate to areas where we have established hubs at or near key customers to allow them quick access to our products. We retain ownership of the product at consignment locations until the product is pulled by the customer. Consignment sales are managed by our internal sales team and accounted for approximately 9% of our total worldwide revenues in fiscal 2017.
The majority of our sales are through distributors. In general, distributors who serve our customers worldwide and distributors who serve our customers in the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific region, have rights to price protection, stock rotations and other credits/allowances. For certain distributors, due to the uncertainty of the amount of the credits related to these programs, revenue is not recognized until the product has been sold by the distributor to an end customer. For those distributors where we can reliably estimate credits related to these programs, revenue is recognized upon shipment to these distributors. Revenue recognized on sales through distributors represented approximately 46% of our total worldwide revenues in fiscal 2017.
Sales through two distributors in each of fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in each period. Sales through a distributor, Avnet and its affiliates, represented approximately 10%, 15% and 14% of our total revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales through another distributor, Uniquest, represented approximately 11%, 16% and 16% of our total revenues in each of the fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. SK Hynix and its affiliates, which is a direct OEM customer, accounted for 12% of our revenues in fiscal 2016. No other distributor or single direct or consignment customer represented 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Customers
We market our products on a worldwide basis, primarily to OEMs who, in turn, incorporate our products into the customers’ products marketed under their brands. We work closely with our OEM customers to design and integrate current and next generation products to meet the requirements of end users.  Many of our end customer OEMs have outsourced their manufacturing to a concentrated group of global EMSs and original design manufacturers (ODMs), who then buy product directly from us or through our distributors on behalf of the OEM. These EMSs and ODMs have achieved greater autonomy in design win, product qualification and product purchasing decisions, especially for commodity products. SK Hynix and its affiliates accounted for 12% of our revenues in fiscal 2016. No other direct OEM customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2017 and 2015. 
Manufacturing
We currently use third-party foundries that are primarily located in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region and Germany who provide wafer fabrication requirements for our products. We assemble or package products at several different subcontractors in the APAC region. Utilizing several different subcontractors located in different countries enables us to negotiate lower prices and limits the risk associated with production concentration in one country or company. The criteria used to select assembly subcontractors include, but are not limited to, cost, quality, delivery, automotive certification and subcontractor financial stability. We perform the vast majority of our test operations at our test facilities located in Malaysia and Germany. A relatively small amount of test operations are also performed at third-party subcontractors in the APAC region.
Backlog
We offer custom designed products, as well as industry-standard products and application-specific standard products. Sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders, which are frequently revised by customers as their requirements change. We have also entered into master purchase agreements, which do not require minimum purchase quantities, with many of our OEM and EMS customers. We schedule product deliveries upon receipt of purchase orders under the related customer agreements. Generally, these purchase orders and customer agreements, especially those for standard products, also allow customers to change the quantities, reschedule delivery dates and cancel purchase orders without significant penalties. In general, orders, especially for industry standard products, are often made with very short lead times and may be canceled, rescheduled, re-priced or otherwise revised prior to shipment. In addition, certain distributor orders are subject to price adjustments both before and after shipment.  For all these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog is a reliable indicator of future revenues.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts emphasize the development and design of proprietary, differentiated, high-performance, low-power analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products. We believe that a sustained level of investment in research and development is necessary to maintain our competitive position. We operate research and development centers in Irvine, San Jose and San Diego, California; Tempe, Arizona; Duluth, Georgia; Westford, Massachusetts; Smithfield, Rhode Island; Ottawa, Canada; Shanghai, China; Dresden, Munich and Stuttgart, Germany; and Varna and Sofia Bulgaria. Research and development expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were approximately 23%, 21% and 22% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Our product development activities are focused on the design of integrated circuits that provide differentiated features and enhanced performance primarily for communications, computing, consumer, automotive and industrial applications.
Competition
The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological advances, cyclical market patterns, erosion of product sale prices and evolving industry standards. Many of our competitors have substantially greater technical, marketing, manufacturing or financial resources than we do. In addition, several foreign competitors receive financial assistance from their governments, which could give them a competitive advantage. We compete in different product areas to varying degrees on the basis of technical innovation and product performance, as well as product quality, availability and price.
Our competitive strategy is to use our applications expertise to develop a deep understanding of customers’ systems and to use our unique combination of analog and digital technologies to develop complete product portfolios that solve our customers’ whole problem. We differentiate our products through innovative configurations, proprietary features, high performance, and breadth of offerings. Our ability to compete successfully and to expand our business will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:

▪ | Performance, feature, quality and price of our products;


▪ | Timing and success of new product introductions by us, our customers and our competitors;


▪ | Quality of technical service and support and brand awareness;


▪ | Cost effectiveness of our design, development, manufacturing and marketing efforts; and


▪ | Global economic conditions.

Intellectual Property and Licensing
We rely primarily on our patents, trade secrets, contractual provisions, licenses, copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights mechanisms to protect our intellectual property.  We believe that our intellectual property is a key corporate asset, and we continue to invest in intellectual property protection. We also intend to increase the breadth of our patent portfolio. There can be no assurance that any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us or that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights will be successful.
In recent years, there has been a growing trend of companies resorting to litigation to protect their semiconductor technology from unauthorized use by others. We have been involved in patent litigation, which has impacted or could impact our operating results. Although we have obtained patent licenses from certain semiconductor manufacturers, we do not have licenses from a number of semiconductor manufacturers with broad patent portfolios.  While we are not knowingly infringing on any of their patents, these semiconductor manufacturers may resort to litigation or other means in an effort to allege infringement and force us to obtain licenses to their patents. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual property rights. While we have filed patent applications, we cannot be certain that these applications will issue into patents or that we will be able to obtain the patent coverage and other intellectual property rights necessary to protect our technology.  Further, we cannot be certain that once granted, the intellectual property rights covered by such patents will not be challenged by other parties.
Environmental Regulation
We are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees, customers and the public. We endeavor to adhere to the most stringent standards across all of our facilities, to encourage pollution prevention and to strive towards continual improvement. As an integral part of our total quality management system, we strive to exceed compliance with regulatory standards in order to achieve a standard of excellence in environmental, health and safety management practices.
Our test facilities are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, particularly with respect to the storage, handling, use, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals, gases and other substances used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive position. Although we believe that we are fully compliant with all applicable environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us. Any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in fines, suspension of production and legal liability.
Employees
As of April 2, 2017, we had approximately 1,623 employees worldwide, with approximately 602 employees located in the United States.  Our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, particularly engineers, who are often in great demand. We have implemented policies enabling our employees to share in our success, including stock option, restricted stock unit, stock purchase and incentive bonus plans. We have never had a work stoppage related to labor issues. As of April 2, 2017, we have seven employees in France who are covered by a national trade union collective bargaining agreement, and 183 employees in Germany are currently represented by a works council.
