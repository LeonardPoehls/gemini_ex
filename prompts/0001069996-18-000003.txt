ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
GENERAL
Federated National Holding Company (“FNHC,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is an insurance holding company that controls substantially all aspects of the insurance underwriting, distribution and claims processes through our subsidiaries and contractual relationships with independent agents and general agents.   We, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, are authorized to underwrite, and/or place homeowners multi-peril (“homeowners”), personal automobile, commercial general liability, federal flood and other lines of insurance in Florida and other states. We market, distribute and service our own and third-party insurers’ products and other services through a network of independent and general agents.
Federated National Insurance Company (“FNIC”), one of our wholly owned insurance subsidiaries, is licensed as an admitted carrier, to write specific lines of insurance by the state’s insurance departments, in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama.  Monarch National Insurance Company (“MNIC”), our other insurance subsidiary, is licensed as an admitted carrier in Florida. Admitted carriers are bound by rate and form regulations, and are strictly regulated to protect policyholders. Admitted carriers are also required to financially contribute to the state guarantee fund used to pay for losses if an insurance carrier becomes insolvent or unable to pay loss amounts due to their policyholders. 
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, FedNat Underwriters, Inc. (“FNU”), we serve as managing general agent for FNIC and MNIC. MNIC was founded in 2015 through a joint venture. On February 21, 2018, FNIC acquired the interests in MNIC’s indirect parent company, Monarch Delaware Holdings LLC (“Monarch Delaware”) from our joint venture partners (see “Joint Venture,” below, for more information).

Joint Venture
Monarch National Insurance Company 
In March 2015, we organized MNIC and obtained its certificate of authority to write homeowners property and casualty insurance in Florida from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (the “Florida OIR”). We and Crosswinds Investor Monarch LP (“Crosswinds Investor”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crosswinds Holdings Inc. (“Crosswinds Holdings”), a private equity firm and asset manager, each invested $14.0 million for a 42.4% membership interest (each holding 50.0% of the voting interests in Monarch Delaware). Transatlantic Reinsurance Company (“TransRe”), an international property and casualty reinsurance company invested $5.0 million for a 15.2% non-voting membership interest in Monarch Delaware. TransRe also received a six-year promissory note in the principal amount of $5.0 million bearing an annual interest rate of 6.0% payable by Monarch National Holding Company, (“Monarch Holding”) the direct parent of MNIC and wholly owned subsidiary of Monarch Delaware (together with MNIC and Monarch Holding, the “Monarch Entities”). Crosswinds AUM LLC (“Crosswinds AUM”) provided investment management services to the Monarch Entities pursuant to an investment management agreement between the Monarch Entities and Crosswinds AUM.
MNIC expands our ability to provide insurance policies in Florida and strengthens our relationships with our partner agents. In connection with the organization of MNIC through the joint venture, we entered into the following agreements:

• | FNU and MNIC entered into a managing general agent and claims administration agreement, pursuant to which FNU provides underwriting, accounting, reinsurance placement and claims administration services to MNIC. FNU receives 4% of MNIC’s total written annual premium, excluding acquisition expenses payable to agents, for FNU’s managing general agent services; 3.6% of MNIC’s total earned annual premium for FNU’s claims administration services; and, a per-policy administrative fee of $25 for each policy underwritten for MNIC. We also receive an annual expense reimbursement for accounting and related services.

• | The Monarch Entities and Crosswinds AUM, a wholly owned subsidiary of Crosswinds Holdings, entered into an investment management agreement, pursuant to which Crosswinds AUM will manage the investment portfolios of the Monarch Entities. The management fee, on an annual basis, is 0.75% of assets under management up to $100 million 0.50% of assets under management of more than $100 million but less than $200 million; and, 0.30% of assets under management of more than $200 million. 


• | MNIC and TransRe also entered into a reinsurance capacity right of first refusal agreement, pursuant to which TransRe has a right of first refusal for all quota share and excess of loss reinsurance agreements that MNIC deems necessary in its sole discretion for so long as TransRe remains a member of Monarch Delaware or the MNHC debt remains outstanding. TransRe also has the right to provide, at market rates and terms, a maximum of 15% of any reinsurance coverage obtained by MNIC in any individual reinsurance contract. 


• | Our Chief Executive Officer holds his respective position and our Chief Accounting Officer holds the position of Chief Financial Officer with the Monarch Entities while each remain employed by us.

On November 27, 2017, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Crosswinds Investor and TransRe, whereby we agreed to purchase Crosswinds Investor’s 42.4% Class A membership interest and 50.0% voting interest for $12.3 million, and TransRe’s 15.2% non-voting membership interest in Monarch Delaware for $4.4 million. We completed this transaction on February 21, 2018 for the agreed upon purchase price and repaid the outstanding principal balance and interest due on the $5.0 million promissory note to TransRe. Following the closing, Monarch Delaware and Monarch Holdings were merged into FNIC. With the completion of these transaction, FNIC owns 100% of MNIC.
Crosswinds AUM continues to serve as a consultant to FNHC for a quarterly fee of $75,000 through December 31, 2018, and a subsidiary of Crosswinds Holdings and TransRe each have a right of first refusal through December 31, 2018 to participate in our catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance program, at market rates and terms, up to a placement of $10.0 million in reinsurance limit in the aggregate from Crosswinds Holdings and up to a placement of $10.0 million in reinsurance limit in excess of its placement on our current catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance program from TransRe.

INSURANCE OPERATIONS AND RELATED SERVICES
Business Strategy
We expect that in 2018 we will advance our enterprise value through:

• | focusing on our core operations, the Homeowners line of business, while withdrawing from our Automobile and Commercial General Liability coverages;


• | leveraging our recently attained 100% ownership of MNIC by developing and implementing a plan in 2018 to expand upon MNIC’s pricing and product offerings in 2019 to increase market share in the risk-adjusted portion of the Florida homeowners market;


• | focusing on operational efficiencies in our homeowners operations to reduce expenses and increase our use of technology;


• | enhancing our property analytical metrics, such as an increased geographical dispersion of risks, while managing our underwriting appetite, whether new or renewal, to ensure a balanced book of business;


• | continued expansion of our homeowners products into other states;


• | maintaining a commitment to provide high quality customer service to our agents and insureds;


• | strengthening of our marketing efforts by retaining key personnel and implementing direct marketing technologies;


• | offering attractive incentives to our agents to place a high volume of quality business with our companies;


• | continuing with our strong catastrophe reinsurance programs; and


• | additional strategies that may include possible mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures or dispositions of assets.

Overview of Insurance Lines of Business
Homeowners Property and Casualty Insurance
FNIC and MNIC underwrite homeowners insurance in Florida and FNIC also underwrites homeowners insurance in Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina and Alabama. Homeowners insurance generally protects an owner of real and personal property against covered causes of loss to that property. As of December 31, 2017, the total homeowners policies in-force was 302,925, of which 272,346 were in Florida and 30,579 were outside of Florida. As of December 31, 2016, the total homeowners policies in-force was 299,512, of which 279,109 were in Florida and 20,403 were outside of Florida. 
Florida
Our homeowners insurance products provide maximum dwelling coverage of approximately $3.5 million, with the aggregate maximum policy limit being approximately $6.3 million. We currently offer dwelling coverage “A” up to $4.0 million with an aggregate total insured value of $6.5 million. We continually review and update these limits; during 2015, coverage “A” and total insured value were increased by $1.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively, each of which has remained unchanged to date. The approximate average premium on the policies currently in-force is $1,785, as compared with $1,716 for 2016. The typical deductible is either $2,500 or $1,000 for non-hurricane-related claims and generally 2% of the coverage amount for the structure for hurricane-related claims.
Premium rates charged to our homeowners insurance policyholders are continually evaluated to assure that they meet the expectation that they are actuarially sound and produce a reasonable level of profit (neither excessive, inadequate or discriminatory). Premium rates in Florida and other states are regulated and approved by the respective states’ office of insurance regulation.  We continuously monitor and seek appropriate adjustment to our rates in order to remain competitive and profitable.
In 2017, FNIC applied for a statewide average rate increase of 6.5% for Florida homeowners multiple-peril insurance policies only, which was approved and increased by the Florida OIR to a statewide average rate increase of 10.0% and became effective for new and renewal policies on August 1, 2017. In 2016, FNIC applied for a rate increase of 5.6% for Florida homeowners multiple-peril insurance policies, which was approved by the Florida OIR and became effective for new and renewal policies on August 1, 2016. 
-4-

Also in 2016, MNIC applied for a statewide rate decrease of 11.9% for Florida homeowners multiple-peril insurance policies, which was approved by the Florida OIR and became effective for new and renewal policies on April 15, 2016. Lastly, in 2017, MNIC applied for a statewide rate increase of 2.0% for Florida homeowners multiple-peril insurance policies, which was approved by the Florida OIR and became effective for new and renewal policies on October 1, 2017. 

Non-Florida
Our non-Florida homeowners insurance products provide maximum dwelling coverage of approximately $1.8 million, with the aggregate maximum policy limit being approximately $3.5 million. We currently offer dwelling coverage “A” up to $2.0 million with an aggregate total insured value of $3.5 million. The approximate average premium on the policies currently in-force is $1,803, as compared with $1,868 for 2016. The typical deductible is either $2,500 or $1,000 for non-hurricane-related claims and generally 2% of the coverage amount for the structure for hurricane-related claims.
Other Lines of Business
Personal Automobile: On December 19, 2017, we announced our decision to undergo an orderly withdrawal from this line of business and began the appropriate steps, including submitting all required regulatory filings and obtaining regulatory approvals. Subject to such approvals, we expect our personal automobile line of business to materially cease by the fourth quarter of 2018. We provide nonstandard personal automobile insurance principally to insureds who were unable to obtain standard insurance coverage due to such factors such as driving record, age, vehicle type or other, including market conditions. FNIC offered this line of business as an admitted carrier in Florida, Texas, Georgia and Alabama, and marketed the insurance through licensed general agents in their respective territories. 
Commercial General Liability: On March 13, 2018, we announced our decision to undergo an orderly withdrawal from this line of business and will begin the appropriate steps, including submitting all required regulatory filings and obtaining regulatory approvals. We underwrite for approximately 380 classes of skilled craft workers (excluding home-builders and developers) and mercantile trades (such as owners, landlords and tenants). The limits of liability range from $100,000 per occurrence with a $200,000 policy aggregate to $1.0 million per occurrence with a $2.0 million policy aggregate.  We market the commercial general liability insurance products through independent agents and a limited number of unaffiliated general agencies. 
Flood:  FNIC writes flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (“NFIP”). We write the policy for the NFIP, which assumes 100% of the flood risk while we retain a commission for our service. FNIC offers this line of business in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina and Alabama.
MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
Our independent agents and general agents have the authority to sell and bind insurance coverage in accordance with procedures established by FNU. FNU reviews all coverage bound by the agents promptly and generally accepts all coverage that falls within stated underwriting criteria. For all policies issued, FNU also has the right, within a period that varies by state between 60 days and 120 days from a policy’s inception, to cancel any policy, upon an advanced notice provided in accordance with statutory specific guidelines, even if the risk falls within our underwriting criteria.  We are focusing our marketing efforts on continuing to expand our distribution network while maintaining our commitment to long-term relationships. We market our products and services throughout Florida and in other states by establishing relationships with additional independent agents and general agents. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals to offer additional insurance products or expand into other states.
We believe that our integrated computer systems, which allow for rapid automated premium quotation and policy issuance by our agents, are key elements in providing quality service to both our agents and insureds for our various lines of business.
LIABILITY FOR LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES
We are directly liable for loss and loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) payments under the terms of the insurance policies that are underwritten by our insurance companies.  In many cases, there may be a time lag between the occurrence and reporting of an insured loss and our payment of that loss. As required by insurance regulations and accounting rules, we reflect the liability for the ultimate payment of all incurred losses and LAE by establishing a liability for those unpaid losses and LAE for both reported and unreported claims, which represent estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses.
When a claim involving a probable loss is reported, we establish a liability for the estimated amount of our ultimate loss and LAE payments. We based our estimate upon such factors as the type of loss, jurisdiction of the occurrence, knowledge of the circumstances 
-5-

surrounding the claim, severity of injury or damage, potential for ultimate exposure, estimate of liability on the part of the insured, past experience with similar claims and the applicable policy provisions.
We also establish a liability on an aggregate basis to provide for incurred but not yet reported (“IBNR”). The estimates of the liability for loss and LAE reserves are subject to the effect of trends in claims severity and frequency and are continually reviewed. As part of this process, we review historical data and consider various factors, including known and anticipated legal developments, inflation and economic conditions. As experience develops and other data becomes available, these estimates are revised, as required, resulting in an increase or decrease of the existing liability for loss and LAE reserves. Adjustments are reflected in results of operations in the period in which they are made and the liability may deviate substantially from prior estimates.
Among our classes of insurance, the automobile and homeowners liability claims historically tend to have longer time lapses between the occurrence of the event, the reporting of the claim and the final settlement, than do automobile physical damage and homeowners property claims. These liability claims often involve parties filing suit and therefore may result in litigation. By comparison, property damage claims tend to be reported in a relatively shorter period of time and settled in a shorter time frame with less occurrence of litigation.
REINSURANCE
Reinsurance is used to mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events such as natural and man-made catastrophes, manage overall capital adequacy and protect capital resources. We reinsure (cede) a portion of written premiums on an excess of loss or a quota share basis in order to limit our loss exposure. To the extent that reinsuring companies are unable to meet their obligations assumed under these reinsurance agreements, we remain primarily liable to our policyholders. 
Reinsurance markets include:

• | Traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the United States (“U.S.”), Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;


• | Capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and, 


• | Other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance.

The form of reinsurance that we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:

• | Proportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premium and losses to reinsurers;


• | Non-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or


• | Facultative contracts that reinsure individual policies.

Significant Reinsurance Contracts
FNIC and MNIC operate primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct accounts on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those exceed the desired retention level.  We continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.  Our reinsurance contracts do not relieve FNIC or MNIC from their direct obligations to the insured. 
While it is not always possible to reinsure every known and unknown risk to our company, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.  There is a credit risk exposure with respect to ceded losses to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance contracts. The collectability of reinsurance is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers, interpretation of contract language and other factors.  The availability and amount of ceded premiums and losses associated with the acquisition of reinsurance will vary year to year.  Our reinsurance program is subject to approval primarily by the Florida OIR and other regulators in states where we do business, and subject to review by Demotech, Inc. (“Demotech”). Demotech provides Financial Stability Ratings (“FSR”) for property and casualty insurance companies throughout the United States.
-6-

We are selective in choosing reinsurers and consider numerous factors, the most important of which are the financial stability of the reinsurer or capital specifically pledged to uphold the contract, its history of responding to claims and its overall reputation. In an effort to minimize our exposure to the insolvency of a reinsurer, we evaluate the acceptability and review the financial condition of the reinsurer at least annually with the assistance of our reinsurance broker. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had over 75 reinsurance companies on our program which are required to have at least an “A-” or better rating by A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”) or the agreement would need to be fully collateralized.
2016-2017 Reinsurance Programs
FNIC’s 2016-2017 reinsurance programs, costing $179.5 million, included $125.6 million for the private reinsurance for FNIC’s Florida exposure, including prepaid automatic premium reinstatement protection on all layers, along with $53.9 million payable to the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (“FHCF”). The combination of private and FHCF reinsurance treaties afforded FNIC with $2.2 billion of aggregate coverage with a maximum single event coverage totaling $1.6 billion, exclusive of retentions.  FNIC maintained its FHCF participation at 75% for the 2016 hurricane season.  FNIC’s single event pre-tax retention for a catastrophic event in Florida was $18.5 million. In addition, FNIC purchased separate underlying reinsurance layers in Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina and Alabama to cover losses and LAE outside of Florida for each catastrophic event from $8.0 million to $18.5 million. Depending on the characteristics of the catastrophic event, and the states involved, FNIC’s single event pre-tax retention could have been as low as $8.0 million. The maximum pre-tax retention was $18.5 million.
Additionally, our private market excess of loss treaties became effective June 1, 2016 and July 1, 2016, and all private layers, except the FHCF supplemental layer reinsurance contract, have prepaid automatic reinstatement protection, which afforded us with additional coverage against multiple catastrophic events in the same hurricane season. We obtained multiple year protection for a portion of its program; as a result, some of the coverage expired on June 30, 2017, and a portion of the coverage will remain in-force one additional treaty year until June 30, 2018. These private market excess of loss treaties structure coverage into layers, with a cascading feature such that substantially all private layers attach after $18.5 million in losses for FNIC’s Florida exposure. If the aggregate limit of the preceding layer is exhausted, the next layer drops down (cascades) in its place. Additionally, any unused layer protection drops down for subsequent events until exhausted.
MNIC’s 2016-2017 catastrophe reinsurance program, which ran from either June 1 to May 31 or June 1 to June 30 (13 month period), consisted of the FHCF and private market excess of loss treaties. All private layers had prepaid automatic reinstatement protection, which afforded MNIC additional coverage, and had a cascading feature such that substantially all layers attached at $3.4 million for MNIC’s Florida exposure.
2017-2018 Reinsurance Programs
FNIC’s 2017-2018 reinsurance programs costing $173.9 million, including $124 million for the private reinsurance for FNIC’s Florida exposure including prepaid automatic premium reinstatement protection on all layers, along with $49.9 million payable to the FHCF.  The combination of private and FHCF reinsurance treaties will afford FNIC with $2.2 billion of aggregate coverage with a maximum single event coverage totaling $1.5 billion, exclusive of retentions. FNIC maintained its FHCF participation at 75% for the 2017 hurricane season.  FNIC’s single event pre-tax retention for a catastrophic event in Florida is $18.0 million, down slightly from the 2016-2017 reinsurance programs.
FNIC’s private market excess of loss treaties, covering both Florida and non-Florida exposures, became effective June 1, 2017 and July 1, 2017. All private layers have prepaid automatic reinstatement protection, except the FHCF supplemental layer reinsurance contract, which affords FNIC additional coverage for subsequent events.  The reinsurance program includes multiple year protection with $89.0 million of new multiple year protection this year and $156.0 million of renewing multiple year protection from last year.  
As in our 2016-2017 program, these private market excess of loss treaties structure coverage into layers, with a cascading feature such that substantially all layers attach after $25.1 million in losses for FNIC’s exposure. FNIC purchased an underlying limit of protection for $7.1 million excess of $18.0 million with prepaid automatic reinstatement protection.  These treaties are with reinsurers that currently have an A.M. Best or Standard & Poor’s rating of “A-” or better, or have fully collateralized their maximum potential obligations in dedicated trusts.
-7-

FNIC’s non-Florida excess of loss reinsurance treaties affords us up to an additional $21.0 million of aggregate coverage with first event coverage totaling $5.0 million and second event coverage up to $16.0 million.  The non-Florida retention is lowered to $13.0 million for the first event and $2.0 million for the second event (for hurricane losses only) on a gross basis, though the retention is reduced to $6.5 million and to $1.0 million on a net basis after taking into account the profit share agreement that FNIC has with our non-affiliated managing general underwriter that writes our non-Florida property business.  FNIC’s non-Florida reinsurance program cost includes $1.7 million for this private reinsurance, including prepaid automatic premium reinstatement protection.
MNIC’s 2017-2018 reinsurance program costing $5.0 million, including $3.2 million for the private reinsurance for MNIC’s Florida exposure including prepaid automatic premium reinstatement protection on all layers, along with $1.8 million payable to the FHCF. The combination of private and FHCF reinsurance treaties affords MNIC with $109.0 million of aggregate coverage with a maximum single event coverage of $64.9 million, exclusive of retentions.  MNIC maintained its FHCF participation at 75% for the 2017 hurricane season.
MNIC’s private market excess of loss treaties became effective July 1, 2017, and all private layers have prepaid automatic reinstatement protection, which affords MNIC additional coverage for subsequent events, and have a cascading feature such that substantially all layers attach at $3.4 million for MNIC’s Florida exposure.  These treaties are with reinsurers that currently have an A.M. Best or Standard & Poor’s rating of “A-” or better, or have fully collateralized their maximum potential obligations in dedicated trusts.
In addition to the excess of loss coverages described above, our reinsurance program also includes property quota-share treaties. One such treaty for 30% became effective July 1, 2014, and another for 10% became effective July 1, 2015 with each running for two years. The combined treaties provided up to a 40% quota-share reinsurance on all non-catastrophe homeowners property insurance claims in Florida, and 40% quota share coverage on the first $100 million of covered catastrophe losses for the homeowners property insurance program in Florida per occurrence; $200 million any one contract year. The treaties embodied an experience account and are accounted for as retrospectively rated contracts whereby the estimated ultimate premium or commission is recognized over the period of the contracts.
On July 1, 2016, the 30% property quota-share treaty expired on a cut-off basis, which means as of that date we retained an incremental 30% of the underlying unearned premiums and losses. On July 1, 2017, the 10% property quota-share treaty expired on a cut-off basis, which means as of that date we retained an incremental 10% of the underlying unearned premiums and losses. The reinsurers remain liable for 30% and 10% of the paid losses occurring during the terms of the treaties, until each treaty is commuted.
On July 1, 2017, FNIC bound a new 10% quota-share on its Florida homeowners book of business, which excludes named storms. This treaty is not subject to accounting as a retrospectively rated contract.
Our private passenger automobile quota share treaties are typically one year programs which become effective at different points in the year and cover automobile policies across several states. These automobile quota share treaties cede approximately 75% of all written premiums entered into by the Company, subject to certain limitations including but not limited to premium and other caps.
Certain reinsurance agreements require FNIC and MNIC to secure the credit, regulatory and business risk. Fully funded trust agreements securing these risks for FNIC were $2.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Fully funded trust agreements securing these risks for MNIC were $0.3 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2017, we had 419 employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and we have not experienced work stoppages or strikes as a result of labor disputes. We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
COMPETITION
We operate in highly competitive markets and face competition from national, regional and residual market insurance companies in the homeowners, commercial general liability, automobile and flood markets. Our competitors include companies that market their products through agents and companies that sell insurance directly to their customers. Large national captive writers may have certain competitive advantages over independent agency writers, including increased name recognition, increased loyalty of their customer base and reduced policy acquisition costs. We compete based on underwriting criteria, our distribution network and superior service to our agents and insureds. Although our pricing is inevitably influenced, to an extent, by that of our competitors, we believe that it is generally not in our best interest to compete solely on price.
-8-

In Florida, more than 50 companies compete with us in the homeowners insurance market. Three of our larger competitors are Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (“Citizens”), Universal Property and Casualty Insurance Company and Security First Insurance Company. 
Significant competition also emerged because of fundamental changes made to the property and casualty insurance business in Florida in recent years which resulted in a multi-pronged approach to address the cost of residential property insurance in Florida. First, the law increased the capacity of reinsurance that stabilized the reinsurance market to the benefit of the insurance companies writing in Florida. Second, the law provided for rate relief to all policyholders. The law also authorized the state-owned insurance company, Citizens, which is free of many of the restraints on private carriers such as surplus, ratios, income taxes and reinsurance expense, to reduce its premium rates and begin competing against private insurers in the residential property insurance market and expands the authority of Citizens to write commercial insurance.
REGULATION
Overview
Our insurance operations are subject to the laws and regulations of Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina, and Alabama. We are subject to employment regulations of California, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, North Carolina and other states in which we seek to conduct business in the future. The regulations cover all aspects of our business and are generally designed to protect the interests of insurance policyholders, as opposed to the interests of shareholders. Such regulations relate to authorized lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, allowable rates and forms, investment parameters, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, market conduct, maximum amount allowable for premium financing service charges and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of our business. Our failure to comply with certain provisions of applicable insurance laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, any changes in such laws and regulations, including the adoption of consumer initiatives regarding rates charged for coverage, could materially and adversely affect our operations or our ability to expand.
Most states’ laws restrict an insurer’s underwriting discretion, such as the ability to terminate policies, terminate agents or reject insurance coverage applications, and many state regulators have the power to reduce, or to disallow, increases in premium rates. In addition, state laws generally require that rate schedules and other information be filed with the state’s insurance regulatory authority, either directly or through a rating organization with which the insurer is affiliated. The regulatory authority may disapprove a rate filing if it finds that the rates are inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory. Rates, which are not necessarily uniform for all insurers, vary by class of business, hazard covered, and size of risk. Certain states, including Florida, as discussed above, have adopted laws or are considering proposed legislation which, among other things, limit the ability of insurance companies to effect rate increases or to cancel, reduce or non-renew insurance coverage with respect to existing policies, particularly personal automobile insurance.

Most states require licensure or regulatory approval prior to the marketing of new insurance products. Typically, licensure review is comprehensive and includes a review of a company’s business plan, solvency, reinsurance, character of its officers and directors, rates, forms and other financial and non-financial aspects of a company. The regulatory authorities may prohibit entry into a new market by not granting a license or by withholding approval.

All insurance companies must file quarterly and annual statements with certain regulatory agencies and are subject to regular and special examinations by those agencies. We may be the subject of additional special examinations or analysis. These examinations or analysis may result in one or more corrective orders being issued by the Florida OIR. The Florida OIR has completed their regularly scheduled statutory examination of FNIC for the five years ended December 31, 2015, of MNIC for the period of March 17, 2015 (inception) through December 31, 2015 and of MNIC for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no material findings by the Florida OIR in connection with these examinations. 

Various states routinely require deposits of assets for the protection of policyholders either in those states or for all policyholders. As of December 31, 2017, FNIC and MNIC held investment securities with a fair value of approximately $12.9 million, as deposits with the state of Florida, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama.

Insurance Holding Company Regulation
FNHC, as the parent holding company, is subject to laws governing insurance holding companies in Florida where FNIC and MNIC are domiciled. Among other things, these laws: (i) require us to file periodic information with the Florida OIR, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations; (ii) regulate certain transactions between us and our affiliates, including the amount of dividends and other distributions, the terms of surplus notes and amounts that our affiliates can charge the holding company for services such as management fees or commissions; and, (iii) restrict the ability of any one person to acquire certain levels of our voting securities without prior regulatory approval. Any purchaser of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock will be presumed to have acquired control of FNIC or MNIC unless the Florida OIR, upon application, determines otherwise.
Restrictions in Payments of Dividends by Domestic Insurance Companies
Under Florida law, a domestic insurer may not pay any dividend or distribute cash or other property to its shareholders except out of that part of its available and accumulated capital surplus funds which is derived from realized net operating profits on its business and net realized capital gains. A Florida domestic insurer may not make dividend payments or distributions to shareholders without prior approval of the Florida OIR if the dividend or distribution would exceed the larger of (i) the lesser of (a) 10.0% of its capital surplus or (b) net income, not including realized capital gains, plus a two-year carryforward, (ii) 10.0% of capital surplus with dividends payable constrained to unassigned funds minus 25.0% of unrealized capital gains or (iii) the lesser of (a) 10.0% of capital surplus or (b) net investment income plus a three-year carryforward with dividends payable constrained to unassigned funds minus 25.0% of unrealized capital gains.
Alternatively, a Florida domestic insurer may pay a dividend or distribution without the prior written approval of the Florida OIR: (i) if the dividend is equal to or less than the greater of: (a) 10.0% of the insurer’s capital surplus as regards policyholders derived from realized net operating profits on its business and net realized capital gains or (b) the insurer’s entire net operating profits and realized net capital gains derived during the immediately preceding calendar year; (ii) the insurer will have policy holder capital surplus equal to or exceeding 115.0% of the minimum required statutory capital surplus after the dividend or distribution; (iii) the insurer files a notice of the dividend or distribution with the Florida OIR at least ten business days prior to the dividend payment or distribution; and, (iv) the notice includes a certification by an officer of the insurer attesting that, after the payment of the dividend or distribution, the insurer will have at least 115.0% of required statutory capital surplus as to policyholders. Except as provided above, a Florida domiciled insurer may only pay a dividend or make a distribution: (i) subject to prior approval by the Florida OIR; or (ii) 30 days after the Florida OIR has received notice of such dividend or distribution and has not disapproved it within such time.
No dividends were paid by FNIC or MNIC in 2017, 2016 and 2015, and none are anticipated in 2018.  Although we believe that amounts required to meet our financial and operating obligations will be available from sources other than dividends from our insurance subsidiaries, there can be no assurance in this regard. Further, there can be no assurance that, if requested, the Florida OIR will allow any dividends to be paid by FNIC or MNIC to us, the parent company, in the future. The maximum dividends permitted by state law are not necessarily indicative of an insurer’s actual ability to pay dividends or other distributions to a parent company, which also may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations, such as the impact of dividends on capital surplus, which could affect an insurer’s competitive position, the amount of premiums that can be written and the ability to pay future dividends. Further, state insurance laws and regulations require that the statutory capital surplus of an insurance company following any dividend or distribution by it be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs.
While the non-insurance company subsidiaries (FNU and any other affiliate) are not subject directly to the dividend and other distribution limitations, insurance holding company regulations govern the amount that any affiliate within the holding company structure may charge any of the insurance companies for service (e.g., management fees and commissions).
Underwriting and Marketing Restrictions
During the past several years, various regulatory and legislative bodies have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations to address the cyclical nature of the insurance industry, catastrophic events and insurance capacity and pricing. These regulations include: (i) the creation of “market assistance plans” under which insurers are induced to provide certain coverages; (ii) restrictions on the ability of insurers to rescind or otherwise cancel certain policies in mid-term; (iii) advance notice requirements or limitations imposed for certain policy non-renewals; and, (iv) limitations upon or decreases in rates permitted to be charged.

National Association of Insurance Commissioners Risk-Based Capital Requirements
In order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), established risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements for insurance companies that are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policy holders. These requirements measure three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers: (i) underwriting risks, which encompass the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing; (ii) declines in asset values arising from credit risk; (iii) other business risks from investments; and (iv) catastrophe risk. Insurers having less statutory surplus than required will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. The Florida OIR, which follows these requirements, could require FNIC or MNIC to cease operations in the event they fail to maintain the required statutory capital.

Based upon the 2017 and 2016 statutory financial statements for FNIC and MNIC, statutory surplus exceeded the regulatory action levels established by the NAIC’s RBC requirements.

Based on RBC requirements, the extent of regulatory intervention and action increases as the ratio of an insurer’s statutory surplus to its Authorized Control Level (“ACL”), as calculated under the NAIC’s requirements, decreases.  The first action level, the Company Action Level, requires an insurer to submit a plan of corrective actions to the insurance regulators if statutory surplus falls below 200.0% of the ACL amount.  The second action level, the Regulatory Action Level, requires an insurer to submit a plan containing corrective actions and permits the insurance regulators to perform an examination or other analysis and issue a corrective order if statutory surplus falls below 150.0% of the ACL amount. The third action level, ACL, allows the regulators to rehabilitate or liquidate an insurer in addition to the aforementioned actions if statutory surplus falls below the ACL amount. The fourth action level is the Mandatory Control Level, which requires the regulators to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer if statutory surplus falls below 70.0% of the ACL amount. FNIC’s ratio of statutory surplus to its ACL was 301.9% and 307.5% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. MNIC’s ratio of statutory surplus to its ACL was 1,070.1% and 2,419.8% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Industry Ratings Services

Third-party rating agencies assess and rate the ability of insurers to pay their claims. The insurance industry uses financial strength ratings to assess the financial strength and quality of insurers. Ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies and reflect evaluations of each insurer’s profitability, debt and cash levels, customer base, adequacy and soundness of reinsurance, quality and estimated market value of assets, adequacy of reserves and management. Ratings are also based upon factors of concern to agents, reinsurers and policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors, such as purchasers of our common stock.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, FNIC and MNIC are rated by Demotech as “A” (“Exceptional”), which is the third of seven ratings, and defined as “Regardless of the severity of a general economic downturn or deterioration in the insurance cycle, insurers earning an FSR of “A” possess “Exceptional” financial stability related to maintaining surplus as regards to policyholders.” Demotech’s ratings are based upon factors of concern to agents, reinsurers and policyholders and are not primarily directed toward the protection of investors. Our Demotech rating could be jeopardized by factors including adverse development and various surplus related ratio exceptions. On February 9, 2018, Demotech reaffirmed the FSR of “A” (“Exceptional”) for FNIC and MNIC.
