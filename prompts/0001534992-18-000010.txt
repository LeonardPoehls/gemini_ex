ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Our Company
We own, operate and franchise two restaurant brands, Pollo Tropical® and Taco Cabana®, which have almost 30 and 40 years, respectively, of operating history and loyal customer bases. Our Pollo Tropical restaurants feature citrus marinated, fire-grilled chicken and other freshly prepared tropical inspired menu items, while our Taco Cabana restaurants specialize in Mexican inspired food made fresh by hand. We believe that both brands offer distinct and unique flavors with broad appeal at a compelling value, which differentiates them in the competitive fast-casual and quick-service restaurant segments. Nearly all of our restaurants offer the convenience of drive-thru windows. 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the average annual sales per restaurant was approximately $2.3 million for our Pollo Tropical restaurants and approximately $1.8 million for our Taco Cabana restaurants. As of December 31, 2017, we owned and operated 146 Pollo Tropical restaurants in the southeast United States, and 166 Taco Cabana restaurants in Texas, for a total of 312 restaurants across three states. We franchise our Pollo Tropical restaurants primarily in international markets, and as of December 31, 2017, we had 25 franchised Pollo Tropical restaurants outside the United States. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we had five domestic non-traditional licensed locations on college campuses and one location in a hospital in Florida. As of December 31, 2017, we had five Taco Cabana franchised restaurants in New Mexico and two non-traditional Taco Cabana licensed domestic locations on college campuses in Texas. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, we generated consolidated revenues of $669.1 million, and comparable restaurant sales decreased 6.5% for Pollo Tropical and 7.3% for Taco Cabana from 2016. 
The Strategic Renewal Plan (the "Plan")
On February 27, 2017, we announced the appointment of Richard C. Stockinger as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company, effective February 28, 2017. Shortly thereafter, we developed and began implementing the Plan designed to significantly improve our core business model and drive long term shareholder value creation, consisting of the following: 1) revitalizing restaurant performance in core markets; 2) managing capital and financial discipline; 3) establishing platforms for long term growth; and 4) optimizing each brands' restaurant portfolio. 
We filled open positions on our senior management team by early in the fourth quarter of 2017 to ensure the successful implementation of the Plan and the refinement of our strategy and tactics as we move forward. We relaunched the Pollo Tropical brand in October 2017 and intend to relaunch the Taco Cabana brand in mid-2018 once the material aspects of the Plan with respect to Taco Cabana are in place. The relaunch of both brands was delayed as a result of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma (the "Hurricanes").
The items detailed below reflect our meaningful progress during the 2017 fiscal year and areas of focus as we enter 2018:
Revitalizing Restaurant Brands in Core Markets

• | We have comprehensively implemented refined recipes that improve food quality with higher quality fresh ingredients, impacting approximately 90% of menu items at both brands. We have vertically integrated our chicken supply chain, allowing us to control the feed and breed of all chickens purchased, initially at Pollo Tropical. Commencing in January 2018, all chicken served at Pollo Tropical was 100% No Antibiotics Ever (NAE).


• | Multiple operational initiatives have been put in place to deliver high quality execution with consistency, including the implementation of new labor models to improve speed of service, transaction flow, and the quality and consistency of hospitality.


• | Comprehensive research including Attitude, Awareness and Usage (AAU) and Total Unduplicated Reach and Frequency (TURF) studies have been completed by both brands to identify issues and opportunities within our current user groups. Each brand will conduct focus groups in the first half of 2018 to better understand brand obstacles and opportunities as we refine our menu offerings and reposition our brands outside of our core markets.


• | Both brands have rolled out digital menu boards that introduce new menu items that we believe help to further differentiate our brands in a competitive marketplace. Research further validated our new menu direction, including identifying new and future opportunities to further enhance our menu and appeal to our guests.


• | In late 2017, new creative TV, radio, billboard and social media advertising campaigns were launched at both brands that feature signature and new menu offerings being freshly prepared in our restaurant kitchens. New promotional strategies have been implemented to balance everyday value with premium offerings.


• | We continue to upgrade our restaurant facilities, including added signage and exterior lighting to improve visibility. We anticipate that these material upgrades in 2017 and 2018 will provide a clean, safe and appealing environment for

5

our guests and our team members, and further provide cooking platforms to produce high quality menu items with consistency.

• | Regional chefs were added to the field structure to enhance food knowledge, provide culinary training and further ensure adherence to high quality operating and food safety standards.


• | Training systems, process and structure are being revamped in 2018. Materials will be digitized and trainers will take on a more proactive and impactful role in the field.

Managing Capital and Financial Discipline

• | Based on research and financial modeling, we have introduced a tiered menu pricing strategy across both brands in October 2017.


• | Nine Pollo Tropical restaurants were remodeled in 2017.


• | We restructured our organization during 2017 and eliminated field and corporate positions to mitigate investments we are making to enhance the guest experience.


• | In 2018 we will implement a preventative maintenance program to improve the longevity of our restaurant base.


• | Restaurant prototypes for both brands are being redesigned to optimize the guest experience and deliver attractive investment returns at lower costs.


• | We are planning to test kiosks during 2018 which could potentially mitigate increasing labor costs, increase our average guest check and improve accuracy.

Establishing Platforms for Long Term Growth

• | We launched an outsourced call center to answer guest inquiries and handle catering orders, initially at Pollo Tropical. Catering and delivery are a significant source of future growth at both brands and will be keen areas of focus in 2018.


• | We are working with new partners to establish comprehensive digital capabilities that will include refining delivery, catering, mobile apps, online ordering and new loyalty platforms for implementation in 2018.


• | We continue to refine the positioning of both brands in core markets and outside of core markets beginning with Pollo Tropical locations in North Florida and the Atlanta metropolitan area.

Optimizing our Restaurant Portfolio

• | We have rationalized our restaurant portfolio at both brands with the closure of a number of unprofitable restaurants.


• | We are updating our franchise disclosure documents to support potential franchise growth in the future.


• | We plan to update our site selection and restaurant optimization models for future expansion outside of core markets.

Other Events
During the third quarter of 2017, Texas and Florida were struck by the Hurricanes. 43 Taco Cabana and two Pollo Tropical restaurants in the Houston metropolitan area and all Pollo Tropical restaurants in Florida and the Atlanta metropolitan area were closed and affected by the Hurricanes to varying degrees (e.g. property preparation and damage, inventory losses, payment of hourly restaurant employees while restaurants were closed, lost business related to temporary closures, limited menu and modified hours of operations). Other Texas markets where we operate restaurants including San Antonio were also affected by Hurricane Harvey, but to a lesser degree.
We estimate that the Hurricanes negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA and income (loss) from operations by approximately $2.5 million to $3.5 million for Pollo Tropical, net of $0.7 million in estimated insurance recoveries, and approximately $0.5 million to $1.5 million for Taco Cabana, net of $0.2 million in estimated insurance recoveries, and negatively impacted comparable restaurant sales and transactions by approximately 1.0% to 2.0% for Pollo Tropical, and approximately 0.5% to 1.0% for Taco Cabana for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.
Primarily based on a restaurant portfolio examination as part of our strategic review process to enhance long-term shareholder value and, to a lesser extent, due to the impact of Hurricane Harvey in Houston, we closed six of our Taco Cabana restaurants and 40 of our Pollo Tropical restaurants during 2017, including all of our Pollo Tropical restaurants in Texas and Nashville, Tennessee. In 2017, one of the closed Pollo Tropical restaurants in Texas was converted to a Taco Cabana restaurant and we anticipate up to five closed Pollo Tropical restaurants in Texas will be converted to Taco Cabana restaurants in 2018. 
In 2017, we recognized impairment charges with respect to the 46 restaurants that were closed and two additional Pollo Tropical restaurants and five Taco Cabana restaurants that we continue to operate. Impairment and other lease charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $61.8 million and included impairment charges of $54.2 million and lease and other charges related 
6

to closed restaurants of $7.5 million. The 46 closed restaurants contributed approximately $10.1 million in operating losses to income from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, including $3.0 million in depreciation expense.
The restaurant industry experienced a continued general slowdown in 2017. We believe the challenging market and industry conditions, opportunities for improvement at both brands that are being addressed as part of the Plan, reduced media over several consecutive months while we implemented key aspects of the Plan, and the Hurricanes contributed to a decline in comparable restaurant transactions and sales at both brands in 2017.
Our Brands
Our restaurants operate in the fast-casual and quick-service restaurant segments and feature fresh-made cooking, drive thru service and catering.
Pollo Tropical. Our Pollo Tropical restaurants offer fresh, fire-grilled chicken marinated in a proprietary blend of tropical fruit juices and spices. Other favorite menu items include Mojo Roast Pork, TropiChops® (a create your own casserole bowl of grilled chicken breast, roast pork or grilled vegetables served over white, brown or yellow rice and red or black beans and vegetables), sandwiches, wraps, salads and freshly made sides including rice and beans. The menu’s emphasis is on freshness and quality, with a focus on flavorful chicken served “hot off the grill”. We also offer a self-service "Saucing Island" which includes a wide selection of salsas, sauces, cilantro, onions and other items which allow our guests to further customize their orders. We also offer tropical inspired desserts such as key lime pie and cuatro leches cake, and beverages including fountain soft drinks and other bottled drinks. Most menu items are prepared daily in each of our restaurants, which feature open display cooking on large, open-flame grills. We offer both individual and family meal-sized portions which enable us to provide a home meal replacement for our guests and catering for parties and corporate events. Guests also have the ability to order on-line in advance.
Our Pollo Tropical restaurants feature dining areas designed to create an inviting, festive and tropical atmosphere. We also provide our guests the option of take-out, including the ability to order on-line in advance, and nearly all of our restaurants provide the convenience of drive-thru windows. In some locations, delivery is available. Our Pollo Tropical restaurants are generally open for lunch, dinner and late night seven days a week. As of December 31, 2017, substantially all of our Pollo Tropical restaurants were freestanding buildings. Our typical freestanding Pollo Tropical restaurant ranges from 2,800 to 3,700 square feet and provides interior seating for approximately 70 to 90 guests. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the average sales transaction at our Pollo Tropical restaurants was $11.16, with sales at dinner and lunch representing 52.8% and 47.2%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Pollo Tropical brand generated total revenues of $374.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $50.9 million.
Pollo Tropical opened its first restaurant in 1988 in Miami, Florida. As of December 31, 2017, we owned and operated a total of 146 Pollo Tropical restaurants, of which 137 were located in Florida and nine were located in Atlanta, Georgia. We continue to reimage existing Pollo Tropical restaurants to update both the exterior and interior of the restaurants to the latest standard. In 2017, we reimaged nine Pollo Tropical restaurants.
We are franchising our Pollo Tropical restaurants primarily internationally, and as of December 31, 2017, we had 25 franchised Pollo Tropical restaurants located in Puerto Rico, Panama, the Bahamas, Venezuela and Guyana, and five non-traditional licensed locations on college campuses and one located in a hospital in Florida. We have agreements for the continued development of franchised Pollo Tropical restaurants in certain of our existing franchised markets.
Taco Cabana. Our Taco Cabana restaurants serve fresh, Mexican-inspired food, including tacos, flame-grilled steak and chicken fajitas served on sizzling iron skillets, quesadillas, hand-rolled flautas, enchiladas, burritos, fresh-made flour tortillas, customizable salads served in our Cabana Bowl®, and our popular breakfast tacos. We also offer a self-service salsa bar which includes a wide selection of made-from-scratch salsas, sauces, sliced jalapeños, chopped cilantro, chopped onions and other items which allow our guests to further customize their orders. Our beverage offerings include fountain soft drinks, our signature frozen margaritas and beer as well as bottled Mexican Coke and Fanta Orange soda made with real cane sugar. Most menu items are freshly-prepared at each restaurant daily. 
Taco Cabana restaurants feature open display cooking that enables guests to observe fajitas cooking on an open grill, a tortilla machine pressing and grilling fresh flour tortillas and the fresh preparation of other menu items. Our Taco Cabana restaurants feature interior dining areas as well as semi-enclosed and outdoor patio areas, which provide a vibrant, contemporary decor and relaxing atmosphere. We offer both individual and family meal-sized portions which enable us to provide a home meal replacement for our guests and catering for parties and corporate events. Additionally, we provide our guests the option to order on-line in advance, as well as the convenience of drive-thru windows. In some locations, delivery is available. Our typical freestanding Taco Cabana restaurants average approximately 3,500 square feet (exclusive of the exterior dining area) and provide seating for approximately 80 guests, with additional outside patio seating for approximately 50 guests. As of December 31, 2017, substantially all of our Taco Cabana restaurants were freestanding buildings.

Taco Cabana pioneered the Mexican patio cafe concept with its first restaurant in San Antonio, Texas in 1978. As of December 31, 2017, we owned and operated 166 Taco Cabana restaurants, all located in Texas. As of December 31, 2017, we also had five Taco Cabana franchised restaurants located in New Mexico and two non-traditional Taco Cabana licensed locations located on college campuses in Texas. At the beginning of 2017, the majority of our Taco Cabana restaurants were open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. However, during 2017, we reviewed hours of operation across our restaurant portfolio and reduced the number of restaurants that operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week to 32 by the end of the year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales at dinner, lunch and breakfast represented 24.7%, 21.8% and 23.5%, respectively, and the average sales transaction at our Taco Cabana restaurants was $9.43. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Taco Cabana brand generated total revenues of $295.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $16.5 million. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe the success of our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana brands is a result of the following key attributes: 
Well Positioned and Differentiated in the Fast-Casual and Quick-Service Segments. As of December 31, 2017, we owned, operated and franchised 350 fast-casual restaurants under our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana brands which have almost 30 and 40 years, respectively, of operating history. In addition, at $2.3 million and $1.8 million, respectively, we believe Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana have compelling average annual sales per restaurant within the fast-casual and quick-service segments. We believe our brands are well positioned in the industry due to our high quality, freshly-prepared food, value and differentiation of flavor profiles. In addition, we anticipate that the Plan will enhance the guest experience and better position our brands for successful and sustainable future growth. 
Two Leading, Differentiated Brands Serving Fresh, High Quality Foods With Broad Appeal and a Compelling Value Proposition. Our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana brands are differentiated from other dining options and offer distinct flavor profiles and healthful menu choices at affordable prices that we believe have broad consumer appeal, provide guests with a compelling value proposition, attract a diverse customer base and drive guest frequency and loyalty. Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana are committed to serving freshly-prepared food using quality ingredients that are made-to-order and customized for each guest. Both of our brands offer a wide range of menu offerings and home meal replacement options in generous portion sizes and at affordable price points which appeal to a broad customer base. Our open display kitchen format allows guests to view and experience our food being freshly-prepared and cooked to order. Pollo Tropical is known for its fresh, fire-grilled chicken marinated in a proprietary blend of tropical fruit juices and spices. Taco Cabana specializes in Mexican inspired food made fresh by hand, including breakfast and non-breakfast tacos and sizzling fajitas served hot on an iron skillet. In order to provide variety to our guests and to address changes in consumer preferences, we have enhanced our menus, including some seasonal offerings at our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants. We also selectively use promotions and limited time offers which are intended to reinforce our value proposition and to introduce new products. Additionally, our menus include a number of options to address guests’ increasing focus on healthful eating, and we offer our guests drive-thru service at the majority of our restaurants in order to provide a fast, convenience option including home meal replacement and family meals.
Compelling Business Model. We enjoy significant brand recognition due to high market penetration of our restaurants in our core markets which provides operating, marketing and distribution efficiencies and convenience for our guests. Both of our brands have strong brand affinity in our core markets as evidenced by fast-casual and quick-service segment-leading average annual sales volumes, as noted above. With the implementation of the Plan, sales growth and effective cost management, we anticipate that the brands will produce higher restaurant-level operating margins in the future, as they have in the past.
Growth Strategies 
Our long-term strategy is focused on profitably building our base business, growing new distribution channels, including delivery, catering, licensed and franchised locations, and development of new restaurants. Prior to 2017, the development of new Pollo Tropical restaurants was the primary growth vehicle. In 2016, given industry headwinds and brand opportunities for improvement that are being addressed as part of the Plan, we slowed our restaurant development to focus on revitalizing our restaurants in our core markets and brand repositioning outside of our core markets. In 2017, we opened nine new Pollo Tropical restaurants in Florida and six new Taco Cabana restaurants in Texas. Based on a restaurant portfolio examination as part of our strategic review process to enhance long-term shareholder value, we closed 40 Pollo Tropical restaurants and six Taco Cabana restaurants in 2017 and ten Pollo Tropical restaurants in 2016. In 2018, we expect to open nine new Pollo Tropical restaurants in Florida and seven new Taco Cabana restaurants in Texas, including up to five closed Pollo Tropical restaurants that we anticipate will be converted to Taco Cabana restaurants in 2018.
Our strategies for growth primarily include: 
Develop New Restaurants. We believe that we have opportunities to develop additional Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants in Florida and Texas, respectively, as well as potential future expansion opportunities in other existing markets and into other regions of the United States that match our targeted demographic and site selection criteria. However, taking into account challenging market conditions and because restaurants in new markets have not achieved expected sales volumes and profitability at the pace 
we anticipated, we have suspended new restaurant development of Pollo Tropical restaurants outside of south Florida until we successfully reposition our brands in non-core markets.
We target opening freestanding restaurants in order to provide drive-thru service which is an important convenience and sales component for our brands. The location of our restaurants is a critical component of each restaurant’s success. We evaluate potential new sites on many critical criteria including accessibility, visibility, costs, surrounding traffic patterns, competition and demographic characteristics. Our senior management team determines the acceptability of all new sites, based upon analyses prepared by our real estate, financial and operations professionals as well as a third party vendor that employs proprietary location research technology and performs site evaluations on our behalf. Historically, this process has typically resulted in entering into a long-term lease for the land followed by construction of the building or the conversion of an existing building using cash generated from our operations or with borrowings under our senior credit facility.
The following table includes the recent historical initial interior cost (including equipment, seating, signage and other interior costs) of a typical new or converted freestanding restaurant, as well as the historical exterior cost (including building and site improvements) and land if acquired.

 | Pollo Tropical | Taco Cabana 
Interior costs and signage | $0.5 million to $0.7 million | $0.4 million to $0.7 million
Exterior costs | $1.1 million to $1.4 million | $0.5 million to $1.3 million

The cost of securing real estate and building and equipping new restaurants can vary significantly and depends on a number of factors, including the local economic conditions, geographic considerations, size of the restaurant and the characteristics of a particular site. Accordingly, the cost of opening new restaurants in the future may differ substantially from the historical cost of restaurants previously opened. 
Increase Comparable Restaurant Sales. We experienced a decline in comparable restaurant sales and transactions in both 2016 and 2017 which we believe was attributable to challenging market and industry conditions and opportunities for improvement at both brands that are being addressed as part of the Plan. In addition, 2017 was further negatively impacted by reduced media over several consecutive months while we implemented key aspects of the Plan as well as the impact of the Hurricanes. We experienced an increase in comparable restaurant sales at each brand in 2011 through 2015 and we intend to increase comparable restaurant sales in the future by attracting new customers and increasing guest frequency through the following strategies:

• | Focus on consistency of operations and food quality: We believe high quality food and hospitality results in an enjoyable guest experience, which drives loyalty and guest frequency. We are improving systems and processes, including a new labor scheduling tool, tighter management spans of control and regional chefs, to ensure consistency of operations at both brands. During 2017, we improved over 90 percent of our recipes with higher quality, fresh ingredients and through vertical integration and introduced NAE chicken at Pollo Tropical restaurants in early 2018. We believe offering NAE chicken is meaningful to health conscious consumers and differentiates our brand in the market place. In addition, supply chain and food preparation processes have been implemented at both brands to ensure high quality, freshness and consistency of our food, which we believe are critical components to the continued success of our brands.


• | New product innovation: Across both brands, our menus are centered on freshly prepared, high quality food offerings that we believe have both broad appeal and provide everyday value. Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana each have separate teams of product research and development professionals that enables us to continually refine our menu offerings and develop new products, several of which are validated by consumer research. Maintaining a strong product pipeline is critical to keeping our offerings compelling, and we intend to introduce innovative new menu items and enhancements to existing menu favorites throughout the year to drive further guest traffic and maximize guest frequency.


• | Focus on effective advertising to highlight our everyday value proposition: Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana utilize an integrated, multi-level marketing approach that includes periodic system-wide promotions, outdoor marketing including billboards, in-restaurant promotions, local store marketing, social media, digital and web-based marketing and other strategies, including the use of radio and television advertising and limited-time offer menu item promotions. We plan to continue to refine our advertising and media strategies to continue to reinforce the key attributes of our brands which include high quality, freshly-prepared food, an enhanced guest experience, everyday value, convenience and new limited time menu offerings. In addition, we are introducing new loyalty programs at Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana in 2018 to further connect with our guests to build affinity and frequency. As a percentage of Pollo Tropical restaurant sales, Pollo Tropical’s advertising expenditures were 4.4% in 2017, 3.7% in 2016 and 2.6% in 2015. As a percentage of Taco Cabana restaurant sales, Taco Cabana’s advertising expenditures were 3.3% in 2017, 3.9% in 2016 and 3.8% in 2015.


• | Grow our off-premise sales: The inclusion of portable menu items, such as wraps, sandwiches, bowls and salads, as well as home meal replacement and family meals, and an increased focus on catering and delivery will continue to be

a key focus for both brands as we look to capture more off-premise meal occasions which we believe may be significant. Therefore, in 2018 we expect to introduce enhanced delivery and catering platforms utilizing dedicated leadership and enhanced digital capabilities and launch a redesigned website with enhanced on-line ordering.

• | Continue our reimage program: We believe ensuring a high quality restaurant environment that complements our quality focus on food and hospitality will further drive incremental sales and profitability. We continue to implement restaurant enhancement initiatives to ensure safe, consistent and appealing environments at our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants. In addition, we are continuing to gradually update the exterior and interior elements of our restaurants to the current standard to be more relevant to our target audience. We expect that these enhancements will improve our brands’ positioning in the marketplace and offer a consistent, quality guest experience. In 2017, we reimaged nine Pollo Tropical restaurants and plan to reimage additional Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants in 2018 and beyond.

Improve Profitability and Optimize Our Infrastructure. With the implementation of the Plan, we anticipate that our restaurant-level operations for our restaurants at both brands will improve over time and our restaurants will become more competitive within the fast-casual and quick-service segments through new restaurant development and growing comparable restaurant sales and traffic. In addition to growing sales and expanding margins, we also believe that our large restaurant base, skilled management team, operating systems, technology initiatives and training and development programs support our strategy of enhancing operating efficiencies while prudently growing our restaurant base. We continue to focus on maximizing cost efficiencies, including, among other things, implementing profit enhancement initiatives focused on food and labor costs, leveraging our purchasing power and enhancing our supply chain expertise to optimize costs while delivering a high quality guest experience with consistency.
Competition
The restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to price, service, location and food quality. In each of our markets, our restaurants compete with a large number of national and regional quick service, fast casual, and in some cases casual dining restaurant chains, as well as locally owned restaurants. We also compete with delivered meal solutions, convenience stores, grocery stores and other purveyors of moderately priced and quickly prepared foods.
We believe that:

• | product quality and taste;


• | brand differentiation and recognition;


• | convenience of location;


• | speed of service;


• | menu variety;


• | value perception;


• | ambiance;


• | cleanliness; and


• | hospitality

are among the important competitive factors in the fast-casual and quick-service restaurant segments and that our two concepts effectively compete against those categories. Pollo Tropical’s competitors include national and regional chicken-based concepts, as well as other concepts. Taco Cabana’s restaurants compete with other Mexican inspired concepts as well as other concepts.
Restaurant Operating Data 
Selected restaurant operating data for our two restaurant concepts is as follows: 

 | Year ended 
 | December 31, 2017 | | January 1, 2017 | | January 3, 2016

(1) Average annual sales for company-owned restaurants are derived by dividing restaurant sales for such year for the applicable segment by the average number of company-owned restaurants for the applicable segment for such year. For comparative purposes, the calculation of average annual sales per company-owned restaurant is based on a 52-week fiscal year. Restaurant sales data for the extra week in the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 have been excluded for purposes of calculating average annual sales per company-owned restaurant.
Seasonality 
Our business is marginally seasonal due to regional weather conditions. Sales from our restaurants located in south Florida are generally higher during the winter months than during the summer months, while sales from our restaurants located in Texas, central and north Florida and Atlanta are generally higher during the summer months than the winter months. In addition, we have outdoor seating at many of our restaurants and the effects of adverse weather may impact the use of these areas and may negatively impact our restaurant sales.
Operations 
Management Structure 
We conduct substantially all of our operations, training, marketing, real estate, facilities and culinary research and development support functions from our Pollo Tropical division headquarters in Miami, Florida, and our Taco Cabana division headquarters in San Antonio, Texas. The management structure of Pollo Tropical consists of our President of Pollo Tropical, Danny Meisenheimer, who also serves as our Chief Operating Officer of Fiesta, and has over 30 years of experience in the restaurant industry, and one Vice President of Operations who is supported by six Regional Directors and 20 District Managers. The management structure of Taco Cabana consists of our President of Taco Cabana, Charles Locke, who has over 20 years of restaurant industry experience, and is supported by six Regional Directors, one Senior District Manager and 27 District Managers. The Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana Presidents are supported by a number of divisional and corporate executives with responsibility for operations, marketing, product development, purchasing, human resources, training, real estate and finance. For each of our brands, a district manager is responsible for the direct oversight of the day-to-day operations of an average of approximately seven restaurants. Typically, district managers have previously served as restaurant managers at one of our restaurants. District managers and restaurant managers are compensated with a fixed salary plus an incentive bonus based upon the performance of the restaurants under their supervision. 
Typically, our restaurants are staffed with hourly employees who are supervised by a salaried restaurant or general manager and one to three salaried assistant managers and one to eight shift leaders.
Our executive management functions are primarily conducted from our offices in Dallas, Texas and Miami, Florida. Our new management team is led by Richard Stockinger, who serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer, Lynn Schweinfurth serves as our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Maria Chang Mayer serves as our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Anthony Dinkins serves as our Senior Vice President of Human Resources, Danny Meisenheimer serves as our Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer of Fiesta and President of Pollo Tropical, and Charles Locke serves as President of Taco Cabana.
Training 
We maintain a comprehensive training and development program for all our restaurant personnel and provide both classroom and in-restaurant training for our salaried and hourly team members. Technology enhancements to our Learning Management System and a re-design of our e-learning courses is underway to focus our team members on system-wide operating procedures by position, food preparation methods and guest service standards.
The first six months of a new manager’s time is spent in initial training with active coaching and a limited span of control. This period covers basic shift control, team member supervision, procedural and technical skills and management development. During the following eight weeks, managers are under the direct supervision of a dedicated field training manager. The ensuing four months contain intense classroom training with an emphasis on skills building. Thereafter, we customize an intensive, self-paced ongoing development program designed to prepare each employee for the next level of management.
Our training process for new restaurant openings has been developed over the last five years as we expanded into new territory. Dedicated trainers, a new restaurant opening support team and a well-documented training and logistics process is in place to assist us in ensuring consistent execution of the brand standards as new restaurants open. The process consists of digital courses, hands-on training and role playing to ensure we transfer knowledge of our menu authenticity, knowledge and passion for our food and a culture of caring, which are strengths in our traditional markets. Our opening processes and training programs are designed to effectively instill these values along with our operating standards to our teams in new markets.

Our management information systems provide us the ability to efficiently and effectively manage our restaurants and to ensure consistent application of operating controls at our restaurants. 
In all corporate-owned restaurants, we use computerized management information systems, which we believe are scalable to support our future growth plans. We use touch-screen point-of-sale (POS) systems designed specifically for the restaurant industry that facilitate accuracy and speed of order taking, are user-friendly, require limited cashier training and improve speed-of-service through the use of conversational order-taking techniques. The POS systems are integrated with above-store enterprise applications that are designed to facilitate financial and management control of our restaurant operations. All products sold and related prices at our restaurants are programmed into the system from our central support office.
We provide in-store access to enterprise systems that assist in labor scheduling and food cost management, allow on-line ordering from distributors, and reduce managers’ administrative time. Critical information from such systems is available in near real-time to our restaurant managers, who are expected to react quickly to trends or situations in their restaurant. Our district managers also receive near real-time information from all restaurants under their control and have access to key operating data on a remote basis. Management personnel at all levels, from the restaurant manager through senior management, utilize key restaurant performance indicators to manage our business.
These enterprise systems provide daily tracking and reporting of traffic counts, menu item sales, labor and food data including costs, and other key operating information for each restaurant. These systems also provide the ability to monitor labor utilization and sales trends on a real-time basis at each restaurant and provide analyses, reporting and tools to enable all levels of management to review a wide-range of financial, product mix and operational data.
We use an integrated digital ordering system that is integrated with our POS system at each restaurant. Individual, group or catering orders placed on our website or that of our third party delivery partners, mobile app or through our call center are transmitted electronically to the restaurants to provide a seamless ordering, payment and pickup or delivery experience for our guests.
We expect to continue to make substantial investments in technology that we believe will drive sales and transaction growth through improved customer engagement and off-premise service offerings, improve the effectiveness of labor and inventory management and business analytics, and improve efficiencies with our core enterprise systems.
Community Social Impact
We are committed to being a deeply responsible company in the communities where we do business. Our focus is on serving high quality food to our guests and contributing positively to the communities where our restaurants are located. This is integral to our business strategy. Some of our initiatives include:

• | Introducing "No Antibiotics Ever" chicken at our Pollo Tropical restaurants in early 2018 which will provide our guests with higher quality food containing more natural ingredients;


• | Actively working to procure more earth-friendly serving and packaging materials for our products in all of our restaurants;


• | Beginning a program to actively recruit military veterans to work at our restaurants;


• | Providing hundreds of hot meals to first responders, victims, elderly residents and others in Texas and in Florida in the aftermath of the Hurricanes; 


• | Providing hundreds of hot meals to local police, FBI, first responders and local residents in need after the Parkland shooting tragedy; and 


• | Assisting, through our non-profit Fiesta Family Foundation, many of our employees who have personally suffered losses as a result of the Hurricanes or other hardships. 

As a result of these initiatives, we believe we deliver benefits to our stakeholders, including employees, business partners, customers, suppliers, stockholders, community members and others. 
Suppliers and Distributors 
For our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants, we have negotiated directly with local and national suppliers for the purchase of food and beverage products and supplies to ensure consistent quality and freshness and to obtain competitive prices. Food and supplies for both brands are ordered from approved suppliers and are shipped to the restaurants via distributors. Both brands are responsible for monitoring quality control, for the supervision of these suppliers and for conducting inspections to observe preparations and ensure the quality of products purchased.
As part of our initiative to improve food quality, we introduced 100% NAE chicken for all chicken menu items at Pollo Tropical in early 2018. NAE chicken ensures that antibiotics were never introduced through feed, water source or any other means during the life of the birds. To ensure this, the Company’s chicken producers are only those approved and certified as NAE compliant by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). If at any time these producers lose their certification, they will be removed from our supply chain network. Fiesta will also work closely with each producer to ensure that NAE qualifications are upheld.
For both our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants, we have long-term service agreements with our primary distributors of food and paper products. In 2014, we consolidated our food distribution with Performance Food Group, Inc., which is now our primary distributor of food and beverage products and supplies for both our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants under a distribution services agreement that expires on July 26, 2019. For our Pollo Tropical restaurants, Kelly Food Service is our primary chicken distributor under an agreement that expires on December 31, 2018. We also currently rely on six suppliers for chicken for our Pollo Tropical restaurants under agreements that expire on December 31, 2018.
Quality Assurance 
Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana are committed to obtaining quality ingredients and creating freshly-prepared food in a safe manner. In addition to operating in accordance with quality assurance and health standards mandated by federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations regarding minimum cooking times and temperatures, maximum time standards for holding prepared food, food handling guidelines and cleanliness, among other things, we have also developed our own internal quality control standards. We require our suppliers to adhere to our high quality control standards, and we regularly inspect their products and production and distribution facilities to ensure that they conform to those standards. In addition, we have implemented certain procedures to ensure that we serve safe, quality meals to our guests. As an example, we utilize the nationally-recognized ServSafe program to train our kitchen staff and managers in proper food handling and preparation techniques. In addition, we have hired a third party that conducts unscheduled inspections of our restaurants, and restaurant managers conduct internal inspections for taste, quality, cleanliness and food safety on a regular basis. 
In addition to food safety, our operational focus at each of our two concepts is closely monitored to achieve a high level of guest satisfaction via speed of service, order accuracy and quality of service. Our senior management and restaurant management staffs are principally responsible for ensuring compliance with our operating policies. We have uniform operating standards and specifications relating to the quality, preparation and selection of menu items, maintenance and cleanliness of the restaurants and employee conduct. In order to maintain compliance with these operating standards and specifications, we distribute to our restaurant operations management team detailed reports measuring compliance with various guest service standards and objectives, including feedback obtained directly from our guests. The guest feedback is monitored by an independent agency and by us and consists of evaluations of speed of service, quality of service, quality of our menu items and other operational objectives including the cleanliness of our restaurants. We also have in-house guest service representatives that manage guest feedback and inquiries.
Trademarks 
We believe that our trademarks, service marks, trade dress, logos and other proprietary intellectual property are important to our success. We have registered the principal Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana logos and designs with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register as a service mark for our restaurant services. We also have secured or have applied for state and federal registrations for several other advertising or promotional marks, including variations of the Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana principal marks as well as those related to our core menu offerings. In connection with our current and potential international franchising activities, we have applied for or been granted registrations in foreign countries of the Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana principal marks and several other marks. 
Other than the Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana trademarks and the logo and trademark of Fiesta Restaurant Group (including Internet domain names and addresses) and proprietary rights relating to certain of our core menu offerings, we have no proprietary intellectual property. 
Continued Commitment to Strong Governance
At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we intend to include a proposal to declassify our board of directors so that beginning at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our entire board of directors would stand for re-election for a one-year term.  Additionally, our board of directors has adopted a maximum age of 75 for any director nominee, including a mandatory retirement age for an incumbent director which will preclude an incumbent director from seeking nomination for re-election to our board of directors.  
Government Regulation 
Various federal, state and local laws affect our business, including various health, sanitation, fire and safety standards. Restaurants to be constructed or reimaged are subject to state and local building code and zoning requirements. In connection with the development and reimaging of our restaurants, we may incur costs to meet certain federal, state and local regulations, including regulations promulgated under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
We are subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and various other federal and state laws governing employment matters. While we pay, on average, rates that are above the federal minimum wage, and where applicable, state minimum wage, increases in those minimum wages have in the past increased wage rates at our restaurants and in the future will affect our labor costs. Also, certain provisions of the comprehensive federal health care reform law enacted in 2010 became effective in 2015. We anticipate that a combination of labor management, cost reduction initiatives, technology and menu price increases can materially offset the potential increased costs associated with these and other regulations in 2018.
Taco Cabana is subject to alcoholic beverage control regulations that require state, county or municipal licenses or permits to sell alcoholic beverages at each restaurant location that sells alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed every one to two years and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Licensing entities, authorized with law enforcement authority, may issue violations and conduct audits and investigations of the restaurant’s records and procedures. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of our Taco Cabana restaurants including minimum age for consumption, certification requirements for employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. These regulations also prescribe certain required banking and accounting practices related to alcohol sales and purchasing. Our Taco Cabana restaurants are subject to state “dram-shop” laws. Dram-shop laws provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated or minor patron. We have specific insurance that covers claims arising under dram-shop laws. However, we cannot ensure that this insurance will be adequate to cover any claims that may be instituted against us. During 2016 certain of our Pollo Tropical restaurants served alcoholic beverages; however, we discontinued the sale of alcoholic beverages at Pollo Tropical restaurants in early 2017.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 10,290 persons, of which approximately 200 were corporate and administrative personnel and approximately 10,090 were restaurant operations and other supervisory personnel. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that overall relations with our employees are good.
