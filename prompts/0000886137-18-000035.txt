Significant Business Developments
Proposed Merger with JD Sports Fashion Plc
On March 25, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with JD Sports Fashion Plc, a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (“JD Sports”), and Genesis Merger Sub, Inc., an Indiana corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of JD Sports (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger), with the Company surviving the Merger as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of JD Sports. At the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding class A Common Share, no par value, of the Company (“Company Common Shares”) (other than shares held by the Company in treasury or owned by any subsidiary of the Company, JD Sports, Merger Sub, or any other subsidiary of JD Sports) will automatically be converted into the right to receive $13.50 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”). In addition, at the effective time of the Merger, all outstanding and unexercised Company stock options (whether vested or unvested) granted under the Company’s 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, and Amended and Restated 2009 Incentive Plan, as amended, will be cancelled and JD Sports, or the surviving corporation, will pay the holder of each such option an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of the Company Common Shares underlying such option, and (y) the number of Company

Common Shares subject to the option (net of withholding taxes and rounded down to the nearest cent). Each award of Company restricted stock that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will become fully vested and free of forfeiture restrictions immediately prior to the effective time, and each such share of restricted stock will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (net of withholding taxes).
The closing of the transaction is subject to the receipt of any required regulatory approvals, the approvals of the Company’s and JD Sports’ shareholders and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The Merger is expected to close as soon as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions to the closing in the Merger Agreement, which is currently expected to be in the late second quarter of calendar year 2018, although delays may occur.
The payment of the Merger Consideration will be funded in part, through debt financing that has been committed to JD Sports by Barclays Bank PLC, HSBC Bank plc, PNC Bank, National Association, and PNC Capital Markets LLC. The Merger Agreement does not contain a financing condition.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights in favor of the parties, as set forth therein, including, among other things, the right of either party, subject to specified limitations, to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger is not consummated by September 25, 2018. Upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, under specified circumstances, the Company may be required to pay JD Sports a termination fee of $28 million. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain other circumstances, then the Company must pay JD Sports its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and related transactions, as well as JD Sports’ fees and expenses in connection with JD Sports’ financing of the transaction, in an aggregate amount up to $5.6 million. Any fees and expenses paid by the Company will be credited against any termination fee that may become due and payable. 
Additional information about the Merger is set forth in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
Operating Strategies
The Company seeks to be the premium athletic shoe, apparel, and accessory retailer and active lifestyle retailer in the markets it serves. To achieve this, the Company has developed the following elements to its operating strategy:
Emphasis on Customer Service and Convenience. The Company is committed to providing a premium, relevant, and rewarding shopping experience for customers.
Finish Line seeks to achieve this objective in stores by providing convenient mall-based locations that feature a compelling store design with knowledgeable, trained, and courteous customer service professionals as well as a vast selection of fashion-forward and innovative products. In addition, the Company has extended the Finish Line brand to shops within department stores, a majority of which feature Finish Line branding and the same trained and courteous customer service professionals to extend the Finish Line brand to the Macy’s customer.
Through e-commerce and mobile commerce, the Company seeks to provide an easy shopping experience, robust product selection, and outstanding service.
Product Diversity; Target Customer Appeal. The Company stocks its stores/shops with a combination of the leading and newest brand name merchandise, including in-line offerings and unique products offered exclusively by the Company. The focus is on the Company’s stores/shops maintaining their status as a leader in premium athletic shoes, apparel, and accessories for men, women, and kids. Product diversity, in combination with the Company’s store/shop formats and commitment to customer service, is intended to attract a core customer (typically age 18-29 for Finish Line and age 30-50 for shops within department stores with a greater focus on females) as well as other key demographics. The Company is focused on offering premium product, which includes the best brands, on-trend styles, and most relevant selection.

Merchandise
The following table sets forth net sales along with the percentage of net sales for the Company attributable to the categories of footwear and softgoods during the fiscal years indicated. These amounts and percentages fluctuate substantially during the different consumer buying seasons. To take advantage of this seasonality, the Company’s stores/shops have been designed to allow for a shift in emphasis in the merchandise mix between footwear and softgoods items throughout the year.

Category | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
 | (in thousands)
Footwear | $ | 1,721,020 | | | 94 | % | | $ | 1,715,348 | | | 93 | % | $ | 1,619,002 | | 90 | %
Softgoods | 117,936 | | | 6 | % | | 129,045 | | | 7 | % | | 179,980 | | 10 | %
Total net sales | $ | 1,838,956 | | | 100 | % | | $ | 1,844,393 | | | 100 | % | $ | 1,798,982 | | 100 | %

All merchandising decisions for Finish Line and shops within department stores, including merchandise mix, pricing, promotions, and markdowns, are made at the Company’s Customer Central corporate headquarters (“Customer Central”). The merchandising management at Customer Central, along with store/shop sales managers and district sales managers, review the merchandise mix to adapt to trends in the marketplace.
Technology
The Company continues to update its digital sites to enhance their quality and functionality. The Company has committed capital and other resources specifically for its growing digital channel, which includes design and content upgrades, mobile and tablet applications, expanded presence on social media, and platform enhancements. Finishline.com and related mobile sites are collectively the Company’s most visited store/shop with approximately 500,000 visitors per day.
To support the Company’s omnichannel commitment as a customer-centric organization, the Company also continuously evaluates and implements improvements to technological platforms, which affect stores/shops, merchandising, planning, allocation, warehouse management, order management, and customer relationship management. These improvements allow the Company to more effectively engage the customer, remain flexible and scalable to support growth, provide integrated service, and have information for real-time decision making.
In fiscal 2016, the Company replaced its existing warehouse and order management system, which allowed the Company to deliver its products more quickly to its stores/shops and customers, further enhancing the customer experience in store and online. Additionally, during fiscal 2016, the Company made enhancements to its customer data and analytics systems, which helped improve customer engagement by allowing the Company to develop customized communications based on individual preferences. In fiscal 2017, the Company upgraded its digital platform, which increased the website’s stability and functionality, invested in enhancements to increase the Company’s mobile first strategy, and enhanced the Company’s information security. In fiscal 2018, the Company launched the latest iteration of the customer-centric Finish Line mobile app and further upgraded its digital platform to enhance security, increase the speed of its sites, simplify the checkout process, and introduce additional post-transaction tracking features. The Company also enhanced its credit card terminals and replaced its legacy HR and payroll systems in fiscal 2018.
The Company is focused on creating an omnichannel customer experience which delivers a consistent, seamless brand experience for customers at all touch points – stores, shops within department stores, web, mobile, social media, phone, email, and direct mail.
Marketing
Finish Line attempts to reach its target audience by using a multifaceted approach to marketing on national, regional, and local levels. Finish Line utilizes its store windows, television, e-mail, social media, search engine optimization, key word searches, and affiliate programs in its marketing efforts. Shops within department stores collaborate with Macy’s on specific marketing approaches, which are generally similar to the marketing approaches utilized by Finish Line.
The Company benefits from advertising and promotional assistance from many of its suppliers. This assistance takes the form of cooperative advertising programs, in-store sales incentives, point-of-purchase materials, product training for employees, and other programs. The Company’s total net advertising expense was 2.0% and 2.1% of net sales after deducting cooperative reimbursements in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. These percentages fluctuate substantially throughout the year during the different consumer buying seasons. The Company believes that it benefits from the multi-million dollar advertising campaigns of its key suppliers, such as Nike, adidas, and Under Armour.

Finish Line has a customer loyalty program called “Winner’s Circle.” Customers earn a $20 reward certificate for every $200 they spend at Finish Line within a 12 month period, in addition to receiving special member offers on footwear and softgoods. Finish Line maintains a Winner’s Circle database with information that it uses to communicate with members regarding key initiatives, product offerings, and promotions. At year-end, the Winner’s Circle program had 10.6 million active members. Finish Line continues to improve the marketing effectiveness of the Winner’s Circle program to strengthen Finish Line’s relationship with its most loyal customers to drive sales.
Merchandising and Distribution
In addition to merchandise procurement for both footwear and softgoods, the merchandising department for the Company is responsible for determining pricing and working with the planning and allocation department to establish appropriate stock levels and product mix. Additionally, the merchandising department is responsible for communicating with store/shop and digital operations to monitor shifts in customer preferences and market trends.
The planning and allocation department is responsible for merchandise allocation, inventory movements, and the automated replenishment system. The department acts as the central processing intermediary between the merchandising department, the distribution center, digital sites, and stores/shops and also tracks the effectiveness of each marketing effort to allow the merchandising and marketing departments to determine the relative success of each promotional program. In addition, the department also manages the implementation of price changes, creation of vendor purchase orders, and determination of inventory levels for each store/shop.
The Company believes that its ability to buy in large quantities directly from suppliers enables it to obtain favorable pricing and trade terms. Currently, the Company purchases product from approximately 60 suppliers and manufacturers of athletic and fashion products, the largest of which (Nike) accounted for approximately 66% and 71% of total Company purchases in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company purchased approximately 94% and 93% of its total merchandise in both fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, from its five largest suppliers. The Company and its suppliers use EDI technology to streamline purchasing and distribution operations.
Nearly all of the Company’s merchandise is shipped directly from suppliers to the Company’s distribution center in Indianapolis, Indiana, where the Company processes and ships the merchandise by contract and common carriers to its stores/shops or directly to customers. Each day shipments are made to approximately one-third of the Company’s stores/shops. Each store/shop receives a minimum of four shipments per month. A shipment is normally received by the store/shop one to four days from the date that the order is filled depending on the store/shop’s distance from the distribution center.
Store Operations
The Company’s corporate and regional senior management visit the stores/shops regularly to review and receive feedback from the stores/shops related to the implementation of the Company’s customer service model, plans, and policies, to monitor operations, and to review inventories and the presentation of merchandise. Accounting and general financial functions for the stores/shops are conducted at Customer Central. Each store/shop has a sales manager, co-sales managers, or team lead that is responsible for supervision and overall operations, one or more assistant sales managers, and additional full and part-time sales associates.
Regional, district, and store sales managers receive a fixed salary (except store managers in California) and are eligible for bonuses, based primarily on sales, payroll, inventory shrink, and other performance goals of the stores/shops for which they are responsible. In California, all store sales managers, team leads, assistant store sales managers, and sales associates are paid on an hourly basis.
Competition
The athletic shoe, apparel, and accessory business is highly competitive. Many of the products the Company sells are also sold in department stores, national and regional full-line sporting goods stores, athletic footwear specialty stores, athletic footwear superstores, discount stores, traditional shoe stores, mass merchandisers, and e-tailers. Some of the Company’s primary competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater financial and other resources than the Company. Additionally, the Company’s competition also includes stores and/or e-commerce sites that are owned by major suppliers of the Company. To a lesser extent, the Company competes with local sporting goods and athletic specialty stores. The majority of brick and mortar stores and shops within department stores are located in enclosed malls or shopping centers in which one or more competitors also operate. Typically, the leases that the Company enters into do not restrict the opening of stores by competitors.

The Company seeks to differentiate itself from its competition by operating more attractive, well-stocked stores/shops in high retail traffic areas, with competitive prices and knowledgeable and courteous customer service. The Company keeps its prices competitive with athletic specialty and sporting goods stores in each trade area, including competitors that are not necessarily located inside malls. The Company believes it accomplishes this by effectively assorting its stores/shops and online with the most relevant premium brands and products in the market.
Seasonal Business
The Company’s business follows a seasonal pattern, peaking over a total of approximately 12 weeks during the back-to-school (mid July through early September) and holiday (Thanksgiving through Christmas) seasons. During fiscal 2018 and 2017, these seasons collectively accounted for approximately 31% and 32%, respectively, of the Company’s annual sales.
Employees
As of March 3, 2018, the Company employed a total of approximately 13,500 persons, 3,700 of whom were full-time and 9,800 of whom were part-time. Of this total, approximately 1,000 were employed at Customer Central and the Company’s distribution center in Indianapolis, Indiana, and the Company’s digital team office in Boulder, Colorado, and approximately 60 were employed as regional vice presidents and district sales managers. Additional part-time employees are typically hired during the back-to-school and holiday seasons. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a union and employee relations are good.
Retirement Plan
The Company sponsors a qualified defined contribution profit sharing plan that has a 401(k) feature. The Company matches 100 percent of employee contributions to the 401(k) plan on the first three percent of an employee’s wages and matches an additional 50 percent of employee contributions to the 401(k) plan on the next two percent up to five percent of their wages (maximum of four percent Company match).
Intellectual Property
The Company has registered, in the United States and other countries, trademarks, service marks, and domain names relating to its business. The Company believes its registrations are valid. It intends to be vigilant with regard to infringing or diluting uses by other parties, and to enforce vigorously its rights in its trademarks, service marks, and domain names.
