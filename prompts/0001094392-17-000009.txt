General
Rudolph Technologies, Inc. (“Rudolph” or the “Company”) is a worldwide leader in the design, development, manufacture and support of process control defect inspection and metrology, advanced packaging lithography, and data analysis systems and software used by microelectronics device manufacturers. We provide process and yield management solutions used in both wafer processing and final manufacturing through a family of standalone systems for macro-defect inspection, lithography, probe card test and analysis, and transparent and opaque thin film measurements. All Rudolph systems feature sophisticated software and production-worthy automation. In addition, our advanced process control software portfolio includes powerful solutions to enhance productivity and achieve significant cost savings. Rudolph systems are backed by worldwide customer service and applications support.
Rudolph continues to drive the technological innovation of its inspection and metrology products to deliver solutions that address the demanding needs across the front-end and back-end processes of semiconductor manufacturing. In 2016, Rudolph unveiled a new inspection suite that includes high-resolution inspection for front- and back-end applications (Firefly™ series) and high-speed two-dimensional (2D) inspection (Dragonfly™ system). The Firefly series features Clearfind™ Technology, a patented technique for enhancing the detection of defects that

often escape conventional illumination techniques by fluorescing organic materials, thereby reducing a source of yield-robbing interconnect failures. 
As advanced packaging continues to drive process development in the semiconductor industry, the demand for lower cost with higher performance has driven manufacturers to develop innovative solutions. One new approach to reducing overall cost is to switch from (round) wafers to a larger-size rectangular panel format. Research group Yole Developpement describes the cost advantages and economy of scale benefits as key enablers propelling the growth of advanced packaging processes such as fan-out, interposers and embedded die panel packages. Rudolph is poised to play an integral role in this transition with its panel lithography and inspection solutions. 
The need for more process monitoring and control continues to increase for semiconductor and related industries. Predictive analytics can lower maintenance costs, rate of scrap wafers, unscheduled tool downtime and material costs. Rudolph’s established fault detection and classification software, which is incorporated into tools manufactured Veeco Instruments, allows customers to seamlessly turn equipment data into actionable operational information. This collaboration is designed to enhance etch and deposition tool performance.
Industry Trends
Advanced Packaging refers to a series of technology that enables the miniaturization of electronic products, such as portable consumer devices, including smartphones and laptops. In electronics manufacturing, integrated circuit packaging is the final stage of semiconductor device fabrication, in which the tiny block of semiconducting material (die) is encased in a supporting package that provides an external electrical connection and prevents physical damage and corrosion.  Packaging refers loosely to the conductors and other structures that interconnect the semiconductor circuits, feed them with electric power, discharge their heat and protect them from damage.  Today, the drive to pack more functions into a small space and reduce their power requirements demands that chip packages do much more than ever before. Examples of advanced packaging are varied and include flip-chip bumping, pillar bumping, wafer-level chip scale packaging and 3D packaging.
One technology used in advanced packaging is the 3D integration of semiconductors and other devices. The technology involves stacking individual die or wafers in one integrated housing. Through-silicon vias (TSV, 3D stacking) are the interconnects that allow communication among the individually stacked components. This offers the advantages of shorter signal paths and in turn reduced power consumption, enhanced bandwidths, integration of heterogeneous components such as sub-chips, smaller surface area and reduced expense. The processes required for 3D integration are still being optimized for yield, and to ensure the functioning of individual microchips.
Fan-out on wafer/panel level is another advanced packaging technology that is being used within the industry as the next disruptive technology for several reasons. First, it simplifies the manufacturing process by eliminating the need for micro bumps, C4 bumps, through-silicon via (TSV) and interposers. Next, it improves cost by eliminating the need for a substrate, which accounts for 35 percent of the packaging cost. Lastly, the technology is being considered as the vehicle for next generation uses such as multiple die packages and may even extend into package on package formats. Because of its low form factor, it is seen within the industry as essential for mobile and wearable products.
The current and projected adoption of smart mobile devices with designed-in capability to enable multiple functions in a single device continues to grow. In reality, there are no longer single function devices, but instead, a combined single device provides multiple functions. For example, smartphone users no longer need a separate GPS, digital camera and PDA. Aided by a myriad of available “apps,” the potential uses seem endless. As a result, these added functions in mobile products are driving semiconductor advanced packaging and display manufacturers to implement next-generation technologies to meet these requirements. These technology shifts are creating multiple opportunities for Rudolph solutions.
Panel Manufacturing. In order to meet the growing demand at reduced average selling price, manufacturers are looking to scalable technology. Advanced packaging facilities looking to improve Cost of Ownership (“COO”) and increase productivity are transitioning to large rectangular panels ranging up to Gen 3.5 (approximately 650mm x 720mm). Traditional technology has been limited to standard wafer sizes (200mm, 300mm). However, with companies progressively moving to larger area packages, they are no longer limited to operating within the constraints of a round wafer. By responding to market opportunities and addressing the stringent demands of customers’ technical roadmaps, Rudolph is optimally positioned to capitalize on the emerging market of high volume panel manufacturing. The JetStep 
 2

S Series, having emerged from the flat panel display market, is readily capable of processing both glass and organic laminate panels in the semiconductor advanced packaging market. The Firefly S Series, designed for high resolution inspection, provides a combination of defect sensitivity and substrate flexibility in a single platform. It reduces capital investment requirements and provides a reliable pathway to transition from wafer to panel-based processes.
Technology
We believe that our expertise in engineering and our continued investment in research and development enable us to rapidly develop new technologies and products in order to quickly respond to emerging industry trends. The breadth of our technology enables us to offer a diverse combination of process and process control solutions. Unique features have been designed into our lithography systems to meet our customers’ changing process requirements. Our metrology and inspection technologies provide process control for the majority of wafers processed today in semiconductor manufacturing. In front-end processes, thin film metrology and defect detection and classification technologies allow yield enhancement for critical processes such as photolithography, diffusion, etch, CMP and outgoing quality control. Within the final manufacturing (back-end) processes, advanced macro defect inspection provides our customers with critical quality assurance and process information. Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing or general handling, and can have a major impact on device and process quality. Lastly, we turn all of the data gathered into useful knowledge for our customers to make yield-enhancing decisions.
Process Control Business
Macro Defect Inspection. Chip manufacturers deploy advanced macro defect inspection throughout the fab to monitor key process steps, gather process-enhancing information and ultimately, lower manufacturing costs. Field-established tools such as the F30™ and NSX inspection systems are found in wafer processing (front-end) and final manufacturing (back-end) facilities around the world. These high-speed tools incorporate features such as waferless recipe creation, tool-to-tool correlation and multiple inspection resolutions. In addition, to wafer frontside inspection, Rudolph’s innovative Explorer® Platform allows wafer edge and backside inspection in one integrated platform to enhance productivity and continuously improve fab yield. Using Discover® yield management software, the vast amounts of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed and classified to determine trends that ultimately affect yield.
All-Surface Inspection. All-surface refers to inspection of the wafer frontside, edge, and backside as well as post-fab die. The edge inspection process focuses on the area near the wafer edge, an area that poses difficulty for traditional wafer frontside inspection technology due to its varied topography and process variation. Edge bevel inspection looks for defects on the side edge of a wafer. Edge bead removal and edge exclusion metrology involve a topside surface measurement required exclusively in the photolithography process, primarily to determine if wafers have been properly aligned for the edge exclusion region. The primary reason for wafer backside inspection is to determine if contamination has been created that may spread throughout the fab. For instance, it is critical that the wafer backside be free of defects prior to the photolithography process to prevent focus and exposure problems on the wafer frontside.
Residue Detection. Residue is difficult or impossible to see with conventional white light imaging techniques. Residue contaminants are often the root cause of field failures, which occur after the material has been exposed to normal operating conditions for extended periods. Rudolph’s new Clearfind™ technology highlights residue on bumps and bond pads or at the bottoms of vias so that they are easy to detect. On metals, it eliminates the high-contrast graininess seen under conventional illumination, resulting in an obvious defect signal against a featureless background. This same graininess in conventional imaging can also cause false positives, which are especially costly at this stage of the process where the sunk cost of unnecessarily rejected good product is high. Finally, Clearfind technology readily detects shorts and opens in metal lines when inspected with an underlying organic layer.
 Automated Defect Classification and Pattern Analysis. Automating the defect detection and classification process is best done by a system that can mimic, or even extend, the response of the human eye, but at a much higher speed, with higher resolution and more consistency. To do this, our systems capture full-color whole wafer images using simultaneous dark and bright field illumination. The resulting bright and dark field images are compared to those from an “ideal” wafer having no defects. When a difference is detected, its image is broken down into mathematical vectors that allow rapid and accurate comparison with a library of known classified defects stored in the tool’s database. Patented and proprietary enhancements of this approach enable very fast and highly repeatable image classification. The system is pre-programmed with an extensive library of default local, global and color defects and can also absorb a virtually unlimited amount of new defect classes. This allows customers to define defects based on their existing defect 
 3

classification system, provides more reliable automated rework decisions and enables more accurate statistical process control data. Reviewing defects off-line enables automated inspection systems to maintain their utilization for high throughput inspection. Using defect image files captured by automated inspection systems, operators are able to view high-resolution defect images to determine defects that cause catastrophic failure of a device, or killer defects. Combining the review process with classifying defects enables faster analysis by grouping defects found together as one larger defect, a scratch for example, and defects of similar types across a wafer lot to be grouped based on size, repeating defects and other user-defined specifications. 
 Yield Analysis. Using wafer maps, charts and graphs, the vast amounts of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed to determine trends across bumps, die, wafers and lots. This analysis may determine where in the process a variation is being introduced, allowing for enhancements to be made, thus yields improved. Defect data analysis is performed to identify, analyze and locate the source of defects and other manufacturing process excursions. Using either a single wafer map or a composite map created from multiple wafer maps, this analysis enables identification of defect patterns and distribution. When combined with inspection data from strategically-placed inspection points, this analysis may pinpoint the source of the defects so corrective action can be taken.
 Probe Card Test and Analysis. The combination of Fast 3D-OCM® (optical comparative metrology) Technology with improved testing accuracy and repeatability is designed to reduce total test time for even the most advanced large area probe cards. The 3D capabilities enable users to analyze probe marks and probe tips in a rapid and information-rich format.
Optical Acoustic Metrology. Optical acoustic metrology involves the use of ultra-fast laser induced sonar for metal and opaque thin film measurement. This technology sends ultrasonic waves into multi-layer opaque films and then analyzes the resulting echoes to simultaneously determine the thickness of each individual layer in complex multi-layer metal film stacks. The echo’s amplitude and phase can be used to detect film properties, missing layers and interlayer problems. Since different phenomena affect amplitude and phase uniquely, a variety of process critical interlayer problems can be detected in a single measurement. The use of optical acoustics to measure multi-layer metal and opaque films was pioneered by scientists at Brown University (“Brown”) in collaboration with engineers at Rudolph. The proprietary optical acoustic technology in our PULSE™ Technology systems measures the thickness of single or multi-layer opaque films ranging from less than 40 Angstroms to greater than five microns. It provides these measurements at a rate of up to 70 wafers per hour within one to two percent accuracy and typically less than one percent repeatability. This range of thicknesses covers the majority of thick and thin metal films projected by the International Roadmap for Semiconductors to be used through the end of this decade. Our non-contact, non-destructive optical acoustic technology and small spot size enable our PULSE Technology systems to measure film properties directly on product wafers.
Opaque Film Metrology. The MetaPULSE® System gives customers the ability to simultaneously measure the thickness and other properties of up to six metal or other opaque film layers without contacting in a non-destructive manner on product wafers. PULSE Technology uses an ultra-fast laser to generate sound waves that pass down through a stack of opaque films such as those used in copper or aluminum interconnect processes, sending back to the surface an echo that indicates film thickness, density, and other process critical parameters. We believe we are a leader in providing systems that can measure opaque thin-film stacks non-destructively with the speed and accuracy semiconductor device manufacturers demand in order to achieve high yields with the latest fabrication processes. The technology is ideal for characterizing copper interconnect structures. The MetaPULSE System, used mainly for fast and accurate measurements of metal interconnect in front-end wafer processing applications, has now been chosen by back-end manufacturers to perform system measurements in new process applications, driven by the need for on-product metrology as feature sizes decrease and pattern densities increase.
Ellipsometry. Ellipsometry is a non-contact, non-destructive optical technique for transparent thin film measurement. We have been an industry leader in ellipsometry technology for the last three decades. We hold patents on several ellipsometry technologies, including our proprietary technique that uses four lasers for multiple-angle of incidence, multiple wavelength ellipsometry. Laser ellipsometry technology enables our transparent film systems to provide the increasingly higher level of accuracy needed as thinner films and newer materials are introduced for future generations of semiconductor devices. We extended this same optical technology to characterize the scatterometry signal from patterned surfaces, allowing measurement of critical dimensions.
Reflectometry. For applications requiring broader spectral coverage, some of our ellipsometry tools are also equipped with a reflectometer. Reflectometry uses a white or ultraviolet light source to determine the properties of 
 4

transparent thin films by analyzing the wavelength and intensity of light reflected from the surface of a wafer. This optical information is processed with software algorithms to determine film thickness and other material properties. By combining data from both the laser ellipsometer and broad spectrum reflectometer, it is possible to characterize films and film stacks that cannot be adequately analyzed by either method individually.
Transparent Film Metrology. Rudolph’s patented transparent film technology uses up to four lasers operating simultaneously at multiple angles and multiple wavelengths, providing powerful analysis and measurement capabilities. Unlike the white-light sources used in spectroscopic ellipsometers, laser light sources make our metrology tools inherently stable, increase measurement speed and accuracy, and reduce maintenance costs by minimizing the time required to re-qualify a light source when it is replaced. Rudolph’s S3000SX™ System is targeted for transparent films in advanced semiconductor fabrication applications at the 28nm node and below. The S3000 product family uses Rudolph’s proprietary Focused Beam Ellipsometry (“FBE”) and newly-designed Small Site Measurement Optics (“SSMO”) to measure the thickness of single layer and multi-layer films on product wafers including device area at site sizes as small as 30x30 nanometers.
Lithography Business
Step and Repeat Technology. Rudolph steppers use projection optics to expose circuit patterns from a mask or reticle onto a substrate to achieve images with optimal fidelity. These systems employ light from a mercury arc lamp that is transmitted through a mask or reticle containing display circuit patterns. Substrates are aligned on the system and the mask is imaged through a projection lens in photoresist material coated on the substrate. The substrate is then moved, or “stepped,” to a second position to expose an adjacent area. Images can be “stitched” together precisely to form larger circuit patterns without any noticeable change in circuit performance. The system repeats the step and exposure process until the entire substrate is patterned. Once the exposure process has been completed, the substrate is developed with an alkali solution to reveal the underlying material. The imaged photoresist serves as a stencil barrier that allows for the processing of the underlying metal or insulating layers. The substrates then continue through the etching, stripping and deposition processes until multi-layer circuits are completed.
Advanced Packaging Lithography Systems. In order to deal with increased input/output (“I/O”) resulting from devices with enhanced functionality, power efficiency and higher frequency, integrated device manufacturers (“IDMs”) and outsourced semiconductor assembly and test facilities (“OSATs”) must improve the lithography capabilities for their advanced packaging technologies. However, the associated substrates and processes are significantly different than those used in front-end wafer processing. For advanced packaging, the lithography system must meet the performance required for finer features. Additionally, since most packaging is an additive process, thick films are used to enable the creation of features. In order for equipment to effectively function in this environment, it must overcome these challenges. Rudolph’s JetStep Systems have been specifically designed to meet these challenges head on. The JetStep W Series is designed for wafers and other round substrates while the JetStep S Series is designed for rectangular substrates (panels). Both systems boast a large printable field, which when combined with user-selectable wavelength options, maximizes throughput while not limiting resolution when needed. High fidelity optics are able to image the fine features required while at the same time achieving superior depth of field to minimize non-flatness effects. On-the-fly auto focus and an innovative reticle management system improve yield and utilization. These features result in a revolutionary lithography system specifically designed to meet advanced packaging challenges.
Flat Panel Display (“FPD”) Lithography. A critical aspect of any leading mobile device is the display. The display serves as the window to the user. Therefore, it must effectively present graphics such as detailed maps, high resolution photos and streaming video in order to provide an enhanced user experience. To accomplish this, the display transistor backplane, which is what controls the individual pixels, must operate at a high frequency and not limit the pixel resolution.  As a result, the transistors must have high mobility and only use a small portion of the pixel aperture. The backplane is manufactured on a sheet of glass; like the packaging substrate, it is non-flat and tends to distort further during processing. Additionally, the displays are getting larger. Manufacturers are looking to utilize larger glass substrates, making throughput a challenge for the lithography equipment.  To overcome this, Rudolph’s JetStep G Series uses high-fidelity optics and the largest printable stepper field available enabling more displays per shot. This feature, combined with on-the-fly auto-focus and magnification compensation, maximizes throughput and yield.  Finally, our patented grid stage allows the system to be easily configurable to meet the customer desired substrate size.

Integrated Software Solutions
Process Control Software. We provide a wide range of advanced process control solutions, all designed to improve factory profitability, including run-to-run control, fault detection, classification and tool automation. Rudolph is a leading provider of Process Control Software in the semiconductor industry. Advanced process control (APC) employs software to automatically detect or predict tool failure (fault detection) as well as calculate recipe settings for a process that will drive the process output to target despite variations in the incoming material and disturbances within the process equipment. Process control software enables the factory to increase capacity and yield while decreasing rework and scrap. It enables reduced production costs by lowering consumables, process engineering time and manufacturing cycle time.
Yield Management Software. Semiconductor manufacturers use YMS to obtain valuable process yield and equipment productivity information. The data necessary to generate productivity information comes from many different sources throughout the fab: inspection and metrology systems, tool sensors, tool recipes, electrical tests and the fab environment. As the complexity and cost of manufacturing processes increase, the value of faster, better analysis to support critical manufacturing decisions grows. As a result, customers are demanding robust yield management systems that can analyze large, complex data sets quickly and effectively. Rudolph’s fully-integrated YMS are designed to analyze data from disparate sources and multiple sites to maximize productivity across the entire value chain.

Customers
Over 100 microelectronic device manufacturers have purchased Rudolph tools and software for installation at multiple sites. We support a diverse customer base in terms of both geographic location and type of device manufactured. Our customers are located in 20 countries. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information concerning our geographic information.
 We depend on a relatively small number of customers and end users for a large percentage of our revenues. In the years 2016, 2015 and 2014, sales to end user customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for 34.5%, 23.3% and 23.9% of our revenues, respectively. 
No individual end user customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014. We do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products. 
Research and Development
The markets for equipment and systems for manufacturing semiconductor devices and for performing macro-defect inspection, advanced packaging lithography and thin film transparent and opaque process control metrology are characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations. We believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products is critical to our success. Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our technical, management and financial resources to research and development programs. As of December 31, 2016, we employed 184 research and development personnel.
 8

Our research and development expenditures in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $45.0 million, $41.2 million and $40.6 million, respectively. We expect to continue our strong commitment to new product development and continue to allocate significant resources to these efforts in the future.
Sales, Customer Service and Application Support
We maintain an extensive network of direct sales, customer service and application support offices in the United States, Europe and Asia.
We provide our customers with comprehensive support before, during and after the delivery of our products. For example, in order to facilitate the smooth integration of our tools into our customers’ operations, we often assign dedicated, site-specific field service and applications engineers to provide long-term support at selected customer sites. We also provide comprehensive service and applications training for customers at our training facilities in Bloomington, Minnesota and Budd Lake, New Jersey and at customer locations. In addition, we maintain a group of highly skilled applications scientists at strategically located facilities throughout the world and at selected customer locations. As of December 31, 2016, we employed 251 sales and marketing, service and applications support personnel.
Manufacturing
Our principal manufacturing activities include assembly, final test and calibration. These activities are conducted in our manufacturing facilities in Bloomington, Minnesota and Wilmington, Massachusetts. Our core manufacturing competencies include electrical, optical and mechanical assembly and testing, as well as the management of new product transitions. While we use standard components and subassemblies wherever possible, most mechanical parts, metal fabrications and critical components used in our products are engineered and manufactured to our specifications. We continue to rely on subcontractors and turnkey suppliers to fabricate components, build assemblies and perform other non-core activities in a cost-effective manner. As of December 31, 2016, we employed 79 manufacturing personnel.
We rely on a number of limited source suppliers for certain parts and subassemblies. This reliance creates a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, and reduced control over pricing and time of delivery of components. An inability to obtain adequate supplies would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or might require us to redesign our systems to accommodate different components or subassemblies. To date, we have not experienced any significant delivery delays. However, if we were forced to seek alternative sources of supply, manufacture such components or subassemblies internally, or redesign our products, this could prevent us from shipping our products to our customers on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Intellectual Property
We have a policy of seeking patents on inventions governing new products or technologies as part of our ongoing research, development, and manufacturing activities. As of December 31, 2016, we have been granted, or hold exclusive licenses to, 268 U.S. and foreign patents. The patents we own, jointly own or exclusively license have expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2035. We also have 87 pending regular and provisional applications in the U.S. and other countries. Our patents and applications principally cover various aspects of macro-defect detection and classification, transparent thin film measurement, altered material characterization, lithography techniques and automation. 
 We have been granted exclusive licenses from Brown University Research Foundation, subject to rights retained by Brown and the United States government for their own non-commercial uses, for several patents relating to the optical acoustic technology underlying our MetaPULSE product family. The terms of these exclusive licenses are equal to the lives of the patents. We pay royalties to Brown based upon a percentage of our revenues from the sale of systems that incorporate technology covered by the Brown patents. We also have the right to support patent activity with respect to new ultra-fast acoustic technology developed by Brown scientists, and to acquire exclusive licenses to this technology. Brown may terminate the licenses if we fail to pay royalties to Brown or if we materially breach our license agreement with Brown.
 Our pending patents may never be issued, and even if they are, these patents, our existing patents and the patents we license may not provide sufficiently broad protection to protect our proprietary rights, or they may prove to be unenforceable. To protect our proprietary rights, we also rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions and licenses. There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will 
 9

not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.
 The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same degree as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in such countries, some of which are countries in which we have sold and continue to sell products. There is a risk that our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate. For example, our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products.
Competition
The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive. We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets that we serve. We principally compete with KLA-Tencor, Camtek and Ultratech. We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics, Nova Measuring Instruments and Nikon. Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology and inspection techniques. Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.
Significant competitive factors in the market for inspection and metrology systems include system performance, ease of use, reliability, cost of ownership, technical support and customer relationships. We believe that, while price and delivery are important competitive factors, the customers’ overriding requirement is for a product that meets their technical capabilities. To remain competitive, we believe we will need to maintain a high level of investment in research and development and process applications. No assurances can be given that we will continue to be competitive in the future.
Backlog
We schedule production of our systems based upon order backlog and informal customer forecasts. We include in backlog only those orders to which the customer has assigned a purchase order number and for which delivery is anticipated within 12 months. Because shipment dates may be changed and customers may cancel or delay orders with little or no penalty, our backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period. At December 31, 2016, we had a backlog of approximately $41.6 million compared with a backlog of approximately $54.0 million at December 31, 2015.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 579 employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our employee relations are good.
