 “J.Crew,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to J.Crew Group, Inc. (“Group”) and its wholly owned subsidiaries. “Parent” refers to Group’s ultimate parent, Chinos Holdings, Inc. 
 Overview 
 J.Crew is an internationally recognized multi-brand apparel and accessories retailer that differentiates itself through high standards of quality, style, design and fabrics. We are a vertically-integrated, omni-channel specialty retailer that operates stores and websites both domestically and internationally. We design our products, including those under the J.Crew® and Madewell® brands and sub-brands, to offer complete assortments of women’s, men’s and children’s apparel and accessories with an enduring style that transcends trend. We believe our customer base consists primarily of college-educated, professional and fashion-conscious women and men.  
 We sell our J.Crew and Madewell merchandise through our retail and factory stores, our websites and select partners. As of February 3, 2018, we operated 235 J.Crew retail stores, 176 J.Crew factory stores (including 42 J.Crew Mercantile® stores), and 121 Madewell stores throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong; compared to 279 J.Crew retail stores, 181 J.Crew factory stores (including 39 J.Crew Mercantile stores), and 113 Madewell stores as of January 28, 2017. 
 Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31, typically resulting in a 52-week year, but occasionally includes an additional week, resulting in a 53-week year as is the case in fiscal 2017. All references to fiscal 2017 reflect the results of the 53-week period ended February 3, 2018; all references to fiscal 2016 reflect the results of the 52-week period ended January 28, 2017; and all references to fiscal 2015 reflect the results of the 52-week period ended January 30, 2016. In addition, all references to fiscal 2018 reflect the 52-week period ending February 2, 2019. 
 We were incorporated in the State of New York in 1988 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in October 2005. Our principal executive offices are located at 770 Broadway, New York, NY 10003, and our telephone number is (212) 209-2500. 
 On March 7, 2011, J.Crew Group, Inc. was acquired by affiliates of TPG Capital, L.P. (together with such affiliates, “TPG”) and Leonard Green & Partners, L.P. (“LGP” and together with TPG, the “Sponsors”) in a transaction, referred to as the “Acquisition.” As a result of the Acquisition, our stock is not publicly traded. Currently, the issued and outstanding shares of J.Crew Group, Inc. are indirectly owned by affiliates of the Sponsors, investors and certain members of management. 
 Brands and Merchandise
 We project our brand image through consistent creative presentations and messaging in our store environments, websites, social channels, partnerships and collaborations, experiential activations and direct mailings; and through our high-quality customer service. We maintain our brand image by exercising substantial control over the design, production, presentation and pricing of our merchandise and by selling our products ourselves and with select partners. Senior management is extensively involved in all phases of our business including product design and sourcing, assortment planning, store selection and design, website experience and the selection of photography used in our brand imaging. 
 J.Crew. Introduced in 1983 and rooted in iconic American style, J.Crew offers a broad assortment of women’s and men’s apparel and accessories, including outerwear, suiting, casual attire, swimwear, shoes, handbags, belts, socks, jewelry and more. J.Crew offers products ranging from casual t-shirts and denim to limited edition “collection” items, such as hand-embellished sweaters and coats, Italian cashmere, limited edition prints and patterns, and vintage inspired details. We also offer a curated selection of other brands that share our values and aesthetic, and that provide unique, hard-to-find items consistent with our brand philosophy. J.Crew products are sold primarily through our J.Crew retail and factory stores, our websites, and through select partners. 
 Introduced in 2006, crewcuts reflects the same high standard of quality, style and design that we offer under the J.Crew brand. Crewcuts offers a product assortment of apparel and accessories for the children’s market. Crewcuts products are sold through stand-alone retail and factory stores, shop-in-shops in our J.Crew retail and factory stores, our websites, and through select partners. 
 In fiscal 2015, we launched J.Crew Mercantile, which features a collection of value-driven merchandise with classic J.Crew style for women, men and children. The collection is available in our J.Crew factory stores, J.Crew Mercantile stores and online. 
 3

Madewell. Introduced in 2006, Madewell is a modern women’s denim brand with workwear roots. Denim is at the core of everything Madewell does: from jeans that fit perfectly to the pieces—tees, ankle boots, leather jackets—that women want to wear with them. We describe our brand as effortless, cool, artful, and unexpected. The products are sold at Madewell stores, select J.Crew stores, online and through select partners.

Stores 
 J.Crew Retail. Our J.Crew retail stores are located in upscale regional malls, lifestyle centers and street locations. Our retail stores are designed and fixtured with the goal of creating a distinctive, sophisticated and inviting atmosphere, with displays and information about outfitting, styling, product quality and services. We believe positioning our stores in desirable locations is critical to the success of our business, and we determine store locations, as well as individual store sizes, based on geographic location, demographic information, presence of anchor tenants in mall locations and proximity to other high-end specialty retail stores. As of February 3, 2018, we operated 235 J.Crew retail stores (including five crewcuts stores) throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. 
 Our J.Crew retail stores averaged approximately 6,300 square feet as of February 3, 2018, but are “sized to the market,” which means that we adjust the size of a particular retail store based on the projected revenues from that store. Our retail stores range in size from a 21,000 square foot store in New York City to small crewcuts and men’s shops of approximately 900 square feet.
 J.Crew Factory. Our J.Crew factory stores are located primarily in large outlet malls and are designed with simple, volume driving visuals to maximize the sale of key items. Our J.Crew Mercantile store concept is located in traditionally full price retail malls and hybrid centers, making our factory assortment more accessible to customers. We design and develop a dedicated line of value-driven merchandise for our J.Crew factory stores, J.Crew Mercantile stores and jcrewfactory.com, inspired by classic J.Crew style. As of February 3, 2018, we operated 176 J.Crew factory stores (including two crewcuts factory stores and 42 J.Crew Mercantile stores) throughout the United States and Canada.
 Our J.Crew factory stores averaged approximately 5,800 square feet as of February 3, 2018, and are also “sized to the market.” Our factory stores range in size from a 10,300 square foot store in New York to a 1,500 square foot store in Florida.
 Madewell. Our Madewell stores are located in upscale regional malls, lifestyle centers and street locations. Each Madewell store is thoughtfully designed with the aesthetic of a downtown boutique in mind, while also reflecting high quality and sophistication. As of February 3, 2018, we operated 121 Madewell stores throughout the United States. 
 Our Madewell stores averaged approximately 3,400 square feet as of February 3, 2018. Our Madewell stores range in size from a 9,600 square foot store in Washington, D.C. to a 2,500 square foot store in Brooklyn.

(a)Excludes two concession stores located in the United Kingdom and France. 
 E-commerce 
 We also serve customers through our e-commerce business, which includes websites for the J.Crew, factory and Madewell brands. Our websites allow customers to purchase our merchandise through jcrew.com, jcrewfactory.com and madewell.com. We also use our websites to sell exclusive styles not available in stores, introduce and test new product offerings, offer extended sizes and colors on various products, and drive targeted marketing campaigns. In fiscal 2017, we added functionality to our website to allow partners to sell their products on our website for which we will receive a commission. Additionally, we utilize a third party to accept and fulfill online orders from customers in approximately 100 countries outside of the United States.
Financial Information about Segments 
 We have determined our operating segments on the same basis that we use to internally evaluate performance and allocate resources. Our operating segments align with our brands, J.Crew and Madewell, which have been aggregated into one reportable segment because they have similar class of consumers, economic characteristics, nature of products, nature of production and distribution methods. For financial information, see our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which begin on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Shared Resources That Support Our Brands 
 Design and Merchandising 
 On the basis of data collected from customers through our e-commerce business, we believe our customer base consists primarily of college-educated, professional and fashion-conscious women and men. We seek to appeal to our customers by creating high quality products that reflect our customers’ aspirational and active lifestyles across a broad range of price points.
 We believe one of our key strengths is our highly-integrated design, merchandising, and production teams. Our teams work together to ensure our merchandise maintains the quality that our customers demand, but evolves to meet the changing wants and needs of today’s customer. Our collections are designed to reflect a diversity of aesthetics that incorporates high quality fabrics and construction as well as consistent fits and detailing. We have also introduced sub-brands within our J.Crew and Madewell brands to reflect and serve the diversity of our customers’ style, lifestyle and individual preferences.

Our products are developed in four seasonal collections and are rolled-out for monthly product introductions in our stores, on our websites, social channels, direct mailings and with select partners both domestically and internationally. The design process begins with our designers developing seasonal collections eight to 12 months in advance. Our designers travel domestically and internationally to develop color and design ideas. Once the design team has developed a season’s color palette and design concepts, they collaborate with the merchandising and production teams to ensure they are delivering a line that is innovative, stylish and meets the needs of our customer. Sample assortments are ordered to confirm the details of the collection, such as how the style looks on figures and how color takes to a particular fabric. The samples reflect the design and merchandising teams’ vision, from color direction and flow, to styling and silhouette evolution, as well as price. 
 Our teams work closely with each other in order to leverage market data, ensure the quality of our products and remain true to our diverse brand aesthetics and voices. Our technical design team develops construction and fit specifications for every product, to enable quality workmanship and consistency across product lines. 
 As products are designed into multiple concept assortments, we believe this enables us to reach a broader range of customers, with a continued emphasis on style and quality throughout all our brands. As a final step that is intended to ensure image consistency, our senior management reviews the full line of products for each season before they are manufactured. 
 Marketing and Advertising 
 As part of our digital-first omni-channel strategy, we communicate multiple brand messages tailored to specific channels including our stores, our websites, our direct mailings, email marketing, online advertising, and social media presence. Our core marketing objectives are structured to drive awareness and differentiation of our brands, increase new customer acquisition, maintain and build customer retention and loyalty and enhance brand awareness globally.
 We offer a private-label credit card in our J.Crew brand which is issued and serviced by a third-party provider. In fiscal 2017, sales on the J.Crew credit card made up approximately 15% of our net sales. We believe that our credit card program encourages frequent store and website visits and promotes multiple-item purchases, thereby cultivating customer loyalty to the J.Crew brand. The J.Crew credit card offers rewards based on customer spend. 
 Sourcing 
 We source our merchandise in two ways: (i) through the use of buying agents, and (ii) by purchasing merchandise directly from trading companies and manufacturers. We have no long-term merchandise supply contracts, and we typically transact business on an order-by-order basis. In fiscal 2017, we worked with 11 buying agents, who supported our relationships with vendors that supplied approximately 72% of our merchandise, with one of these buying agents supporting our relationships with vendors that supplied approximately 56% of our merchandise. In exchange for a commission, our buying agents identify suitable vendors and coordinate our purchasing requirements with the vendors by placing orders for merchandise on our behalf, managing the timely delivery of goods to us, obtaining samples of merchandise produced in the factories, inspecting finished merchandise and carrying out other administrative communications on our behalf. In fiscal 2017, we worked with a number of trading companies, through which we purchased approximately 13% of our merchandise. Trading companies control factories that manufacture merchandise and also handle certain other shipping and customs matters related to importing the merchandise into the United States. We sourced the remaining 15% of our merchandise directly from manufacturers within the United States and overseas, the majority of whom we have long-term, and in our opinion, stable relationships. 
 Our sourcing base currently consists of 208 vendors who operate 274 factories in 24 countries. Our top 10 vendors supply 39% of our merchandise. Each of our top 10 vendors uses multiple factories to produce its merchandise, which we believe gives us a high degree of flexibility in placing production of our merchandise. We believe we have developed strong relationships with our vendors, some of which rely upon us for a significant portion of their business. 
 In fiscal 2017, approximately 87% of our merchandise was sourced in Asia (with 58% of our products sourced from China and Hong Kong), 11% was sourced in Europe and other regions, and 2% was sourced in the United States. Substantially all of our foreign purchases are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. 
 Distribution 
 We own a 282,000 square foot facility in Asheville, North Carolina that houses our distribution operations for our stores. This facility employed approximately 270 full and part-time associates as of February 3, 2018. Merchandise is transported from this distribution center to our stores by independent trucking companies, with a transit time of approximately two to five days, or directly to our stores from our suppliers. 
 6

We also own a 425,000 square foot facility in Lynchburg, Virginia that houses a customer call center and order fulfillment operations for our e-commerce business. The Lynchburg facility employed approximately 1,090 full and part-time associates as of February 3, 2018. This facility employs approximately 270 additional associates during our peak season. Merchandise sold through our e-commerce business is sent directly to domestic customers from this distribution center or our stores via the United States Postal Service, or UPS. We utilize a third party to accept and fulfill online orders from customers in approximately 100 countries outside of the United States.
 We lease a 45,800 square foot customer call center in San Antonio, Texas. This facility employed approximately 220 full and part-time associates as of February 3, 2018. 
 Management Information Systems 
 Our management information systems are designed to provide comprehensive order processing, production, accounting and management information for the marketing, manufacturing, importing, distribution, financial reporting, and analytical functions of our business. Our in-store point-of-sale systems, e-commerce platforms and support systems provide the omni-channel capability to enable us to track inventory from store receipt to final sale on a real-time basis. We have an agreement with a third party to provide hosting services and administrative support for portions of our infrastructure, and utilize cloud based systems in addition to those hosted on premise. 
 We believe our merchandising and financial systems, coupled with our point-of-sale and e-commerce systems, allow for item-level stock replenishment, merchandise planning and real-time inventory accounting capabilities. Our telephone and call center systems, warehouse package sorting systems, automated warehouse locator, order management systems and inventory tracking systems use current technology, and are designed with our highest-volume periods in mind, which results in substantial flexibility and ample capacity in our lower-volume periods. We also subject our systems to stress and volume testing during off-peak periods to be better positioned for optimal performance during our peak season. We are investing in expanding and upgrading our information systems including our omni-channel capabilities, analytics, networks and infrastructure to provide cost effective scalability and reliability to support future growth. 
 Pricing 
 We offer our customers a mix of select designer-quality products and more casual items at various price points, consistent with our signature styling strategy of pairing luxury items with more casual items. We offer limited edition “collection” items such as hand-embellished sweaters and coats, Italian cashmere, limited edition prints and patterns and vintage inspired details, which we believe elevates the overall perception of our brand. We believe offering a broad range of price points maintains a more accessible, less intimidating atmosphere. 
Cyclicality and Seasonality 
 Our industry is cyclical and our revenues are affected by general economic conditions. Purchases of apparel and accessories are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and consumer confidence. 
 Our business is seasonal and as a result, our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We have four distinct selling seasons that align with our four fiscal quarters. Revenues are usually higher in our fourth fiscal quarter, particularly December when customers make holiday purchases. In fiscal 2017, we realized approximately 30% of our revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter. 
 Competition 
 The specialty retail industry is highly competitive. We compete primarily with specialty retailers, department stores, catalog retailers and e-commerce businesses that engage in the sale of women’s, men’s and children’s apparel, accessories, shoes and similar merchandise. We compete on quality, design, customer service and price. We believe that our primary competitive advantages are consumer recognition of our brands, as well as our digital-first omni-channel strategy which focuses on a seamless approach to the customer experience through all available sales channels. We believe that we also differentiate ourselves from competitors on the basis of our signature product design, our ability to offer both designer-quality products at higher price points and more casual items at lower price points, our focus on the quality of our product offerings and our customer-service oriented culture. We believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to originate, define and communicate product and fashion trends as well as to timely anticipate, predict and react to changing consumer demands. 
 7

Associates 
 As of February 3, 2018, we had approximately 13,200 associates, of whom approximately 4,700 were full-time associates and 8,500 were part-time associates. Approximately 1,090 of these associates are employed in our customer call center and order fulfillment operations facility in Lynchburg, Virginia; approximately 270 of these associates work in our store distribution center in Asheville, North Carolina; and approximately 220 of these associates work in our call center in San Antonio, Texas. In addition, approximately 3,600 associates are hired on a seasonal basis in these facilities and our stores to meet demand during the peak season. None of our associates are represented by a union. We have had no labor-related work stoppages and we believe our relationship with our associates is good. 
Trademarks and Licensing 
 The J.Crew and Madewell trademarks and variations thereon, such as crewcuts and J.Crew Mercantile, are registered or are subject to pending trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries. We believe our trademarks have significant value and we intend to continue to vigorously protect them against infringement. 
Government Regulation 
 We are subject to customs, truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, employment, data privacy, product safety and other laws, including zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers and/or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. 
 A substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside the United States. These products are imported and are subject to U.S. customs laws, which impose tariffs as well as import quota restrictions for textiles and apparel. Some of our imported products are eligible for duty-advantaged programs. While importation of goods from foreign countries from which we buy our products may be subject to embargo by U.S. Customs authorities if shipments exceed quota limits, we closely monitor import quotas and believe we have the sourcing network to efficiently shift production to factories located in countries with available quotas. The existence of import quotas has, therefore, not had a material adverse effect on our business.

 We make available free of charge on our website, www.jcrew.com, copies of our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material electronically with, or otherwise furnishing it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
