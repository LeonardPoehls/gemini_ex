Item 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
 
Narrative Description of the Business 
 
 
 We are a fee-based marketing, media and investor relations consultant to public and private companies. We may also invest in companies from time to time, including our clients, as a secondary activity.
 
We operate out of one office in Colorado. Currently, our principal business address is 1001-A E. Harmony Road, #366, Fort Collins, Colorado 80525. We have no specific plans at this point for additional offices.


 Operations
 
 As a consultant to both public and private companies, we promote public visibility and market acceptance for our clients. We use a number of techniques to achieve these objectives for our clients, including developing public recognition of their business plans and strategic goals, managing investor relations, and engaging in website development and media production. We also utilize various social media outlets and services to deliver our client's message.  We are paid fees for our services by our clients under written consulting agreements.
 
Approximately 88.7% of the revenues of our clients in fiscal year 2016 came from entities which were under common principal ownership with our majority shareholder. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded advisory/consulting revenue of $178,019 and $205,667 respectively. Of the $178,019 and $205,667 recorded advisory/consulting revenue in 2016 and 2015, $157,970 and $152,000 is related party revenue. This advisory/consulting fee revenue relates to services performed for Nexcore Group, LP, Peter Kloepfer, and Bohemian Asset Management, Inc. We and the related parties have common affiliates.
 
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $6,000 as accounts receivable related party on its consolidated balance sheet. In 2016 and 2015, one of the Company's investments declared a distribution of $322,726 and $274,715, respectively.
 
Our principal executive office is located at 1001-A E. Harmony Road, #366, Fort Collins, Colorado 80525.
 
Currently, we believe that we have sufficient capital to sustain our business operations past April 14, 2018. We were not profitable for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 but were profitable for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. If we can sustain ongoing profitability, we could operate at our present level indefinitely. To date, we have never had any discussions with any possible acquisition candidate nor have we any intention of doing so.

Markets
 
We believe that the primary reason that clients would work with us rather than competitors is the existing relationships that we can develop. We believe that client loyalty and satisfaction is the basis for success in this business. Therefore, we believe that we have developed and expanded on already existing relationships to develop a competitive edge. We utilize the expertise of our principal officer to develop our business.
Customers and Competition
 
Our business involves acting as a fee-based marketing and media consultant and, secondarily, as an investor. Both businesses are highly competitive. There are numerous similar companies providing such services in the United States of America. Our competitors will have greater financial resources and more expertise in this business. Our ability to develop our business depends on our ability to successfully develop our business plan in this highly competitive environment. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to do so successfully.
Employees
 
             We have one full-time employee: Mr. Steve Anderson, our President. We also have a part-time employee, Ms. Joni Troska, our corporate Secretary. In addition, we reimburse our employees for all necessary and customary business related expenses.  We have no plans or agreements which provide health care, insurance or compensation on the event of termination of employment or change in our control.  We do not pay our Director for any Board meeting he attends.
Proprietary Information
 
We have a proprietary investment screening process to make our investments.  Otherwise, we own no proprietary information.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are not currently subject to any material government regulation. We do not expect government regulations to have any material impact on us.
 
Research and Development
 
We have never spent any amount in research and development activities.
 
Environmental Compliance
 
We believe that we are not subject to any material costs for compliance with any environmental laws.
