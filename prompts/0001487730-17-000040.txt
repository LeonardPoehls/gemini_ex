 General
 ﻿
 We are a diversified global branded consumer products company. The Company manufactures, markets and/or distributes its products in approximately 160 countries in the North America (“NA”); Europe, Middle East & Africa (“EMEA”); Latin America (“LATAM”) and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) regions through a variety of trade channels, including retailers, wholesalers and distributors, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), construction companies and hearing aid professionals. We enjoy strong name recognition in our regions under our various brands and patented technologies across multiple product categories. We manage the business in five vertically integrated, product-focused segments: (i) Global Batteries & Appliances (“GBA”), (ii) Hardware & Home Improvement (“HHI”), (iii) Global Pet Supplies (“PET”), (iv) Home and Garden (“H&G”) and (v) Global Auto Care (“GAC”). Geographic strategic initiatives and financial objectives are determined at the corporate level. Each segment is responsible for implementing defined strategic initiatives and achieving certain financial objectives and has a president responsible for sales and marketing initiatives and the financial results for all product lines within that segment. The following is an overview of the consolidated business showing the net sales by segment and geographic region sold (based upon destination) as a percentage of consolidated net sales for the year ended September 30, 2017:

 Our operating performance is influenced by a number of factors including: general economic conditions; foreign exchange fluctuations; trends in consumer markets; consumer confidence and preferences; our overall product line mix, including pricing and gross margin, which vary by product line and geographic market; pricing of certain raw materials and commodities; energy and fuel prices; and our general competitive position, especially as impacted by our competitors’ advertising and promotional activities and pricing strategies. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in Item 7 to this Annual Report, for further discussion of the consolidated operating results.

 Our Strategy
 ﻿
 Our mission is to achieve superior shareholder returns through above-market organic growth, with a focus on building sustainable free cash flow and further acquisitions. Our vision is to be the preferred strategic partner to our customers with an expanding portfolio of innovative and superior-value consumer products and brands. We believe that building loyalty and success over the long-term is fundamental to executing on this strategy. To transition to the next performance level and deliver long-term value to our key stakeholders, we will seek to realize our vision by pursuing the “Spectrum First” growth strategy across all of our divisions and regions. 
 ﻿

 ﻿
 ﻿
 The Spectrum First growth accelerators - Customer, Process, and People - provide the roadmap for how we intend to execute this strategy. Each growth accelerator has three drivers. These accelerators and their respective drivers are collectively known as the “Spectrum First 3x3.”
 ﻿

· | Customer – Our first growth accelerator focuses on strengthening strategic partnerships with customers. Our objective is for our retail partners to think of Spectrum Brands first when identifying how best to compete for consumers’ attention to bring them into their stores and online platforms with exciting product innovation, converting interest to sales through value products, and being a strategic supplier through total-cost reduction initiatives.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Process – Our process growth accelerator is intended to drive continuous improvements in our products, costs and processes to generate healthy margins through sales growth with our “more-more-more” strategy to achieve above-market sales growth, which means entering into more countries, serving more channels and launching more categories. We also seek to drive continuous improvement over performance, quality and costs, and provide superior and efficient services through our shared services and “Centers of Excellence” model.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | People – Employees represent the third Spectrum First growth accelerator. We are working to be a preferred employer by empowering our teams and providing long-term career opportunities and pay-for-performance through focusing on retention and collaboration; driving empowered teams with trust, competence and speed; supporting alignment and providing more paths for employees to embrace new challenges and advance their careers across the global organization.

 Other Information
 ﻿
 Sales, Distribution and Competition
 ﻿
 We sell our products through a variety of trade channels, including retailers, e-commerce and online retailers, wholesalers and distributors, hearing aid professionals, construction companies and OEMs. Our sales generally are made through the use of individual purchase orders, consistent with industry practice. Retail sales of the consumer products we market have been increasingly consolidated on a worldwide basis into a small number of regional and national mass merchandisers and e-commerce companies that generally have strong negotiating power with their suppliers. A significant percentage of our sales are attributable to a limited group of retailer customers, including (in alphabetical order), Amazon, Autozone, Dollar General, Lidl, Lowe’s, PetSmart, O’Reilly, Target, The Home Depot, and Wal-Mart. Our sales to our largest customer, Wal-Mart, represented approximately 15% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
 ﻿
 Factors influencing product sales include brand name recognition, perceived quality, price, performance, product packaging, design innovation, and consumer confidence and preferences as well as creative marketing, promotion and distribution strategies. We compete for limited shelf space and consumer acceptance based on location and product segment. We also compete with our retail customers, who use their own private label brands, and with distributors and foreign manufacturers of unbranded products, typically at lower prices. The Company addresses competitive challenges with the following factors:

· | Strong Diversified Global Brand Portfolio. We have a global portfolio of well-recognized consumer product brands. We believe that the strength of our brands positions us to extend our product lines and provide our retail customers with strong sell-through to consumers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong Global Retail Relationships. We have well-established business relationships with many of the top global retailers, distributors and wholesalers, which have assisted us in our efforts to expand our overall market penetration and promote sales.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expansive Distribution Network. We distribute our products in approximately 160 countries through a variety of trade channels, including retailers, wholesalers and distributors, hearing aid professionals, construction companies and OEMs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Innovative New Products, Packaging and Technologies. We have a long history of product and packaging innovations in each of our product categories and continually seek to introduce new products both as extensions of existing product lines and as new product categories.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Experienced Management Team. Our management team has substantial consumer products experience. On average, each senior management team member has more than 20 years of experience at Spectrum Brands, VARTA, Remington, Russell Hobbs or other branded consumer product companies such as Newell Brands and Honeywell.

Seasonality 
 ﻿
 On a consolidated basis our financial results are approximately equally weighted across our quarters, however, sales of certain product categories tend to be seasonal. Sales in our GBA segment, primarily from consumer battery and electric personal care product categories tend to increase during the December holiday season (the Company’s first fiscal quarter), while small appliances sales increase from July through December primarily due to the increased demand by customers in the late summer for “back-to-school” sales (the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter) and in December for the holiday season. Sales in our HHI segment primarily increase during the spring and summer construction period (the Company’s third and fourth fiscal quarters). Sales in our PET segment remain fairly consistent throughout the year with little variation. Sales in our H&G segment and GAC segment typically peak during the first six months of the calendar year (the Company’s second and third fiscal quarters) due to customer seasonal purchasing patterns and timing of promotional activities. Our sales by quarter as a percentage of annual net sales during the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:
 ﻿

﻿ | | | | | 
---------------+------+-----+------+------+----
﻿ | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015
First Quarter | | 24% | | 24% | 23%
Second Quarter | | 24% | | 24% | 23%
Third Quarter | | 26% | | 27% | 26%
Fourth Quarter | | 26% | | 25% | 28%

  ﻿
 Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Suppliers
 ﻿
 The principal raw materials used in manufacturing include zinc, electrolytic manganese dioxide used in our consumer batteries products; brass and steel used in our HHI products; and refrigerant R-134a used in our GAC A/C recharge products; that are sourced either on a global or regional basis. The prices of these raw materials are susceptible to fluctuations due to supply and demand trends, energy costs, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, general economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances. We have regularly engaged in forward purchase and hedging derivative transactions in an attempt to effectively manage certain raw material costs we expect to incur over the next 12 to 24 months.
 ﻿
 Substantially all of our rechargeable batteries and chargers, portable lighting products, personal care and small appliances, and rawhide alternative products from our recent PetMatrix acquisition are manufactured by third party suppliers that are primarily located in the Asia-Pacific region. We maintain ownership of most of the tooling and molds used by our suppliers. 
 ﻿
 We continually evaluate our manufacturing facilities’ capacity and related utilization. As a result of such analyses, we have closed a number of manufacturing facilities during the past five years. In general, we believe our existing facilities are adequate for our present and foreseeable needs.
 ﻿
 Patents and Trademarks
 ﻿
 We use and maintain a number of patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are, in the aggregate, important to our businesses. We seek trademark protection in the U.S. and in foreign countries. The Company’s most significant registered trademarks are:
 ﻿

﻿ |

 We license the Black & Decker® brand in North America, Latin America (excluding Brazil) and the Caribbean for four core categories of household appliances: beverage products, food preparation products, garment care products and cooking products through a trademark license agreement with The Black and Decker Corporation (“BDC”) through December 2018. Under the agreement, Spectrum agreed to pay BDC royalties based on a percentage of sales, with minimum annual royalty payments of $15.0 million through calendar year 2018. The agreement also requires us to comply with maximum annual return rates for products. If BDC does not agree to renew the license agreement, we have 18 months to transition out of the brand name with no minimum royalty payments during such transition period and BDC has agreed to not compete in the four categories for five years after the end of the transition period. Upon request, BDC may elect to extend the license to use the Black & Decker brand to certain additional product categories. BDC has approved several extensions of the license to additional categories and geographies.
 ﻿
 We own the rights to use the Remington® trademark for electric shavers, shaver accessories, grooming products and personal care products; and Remington Arms Company, Inc. (“Remington Arms”) owns the rights to use the trademark for firearms, sporting goods and products for industrial use, including industrial hand tools. The terms of a 1986 agreement between Remington Products, LLC and Remington Arms provides for the shared rights to use the trademark on products which are not considered “principal products of interest” for either company. We retain the trademark for nearly all products which we believe can benefit from the use of the brand name in our distribution channels.
 ﻿
 We license the Stanley® and Black & Decker® marks and logos in the HHI segment for such products as residential locksets, builder’s hardware, padlocks, and door hardware through a transitional trademark license agreement with Stanley Black & Decker Corporation (“SBD”). Under the agreement and as part of the acquisition of the HHI Business in December 2012, Spectrum has a royalty-free, fully paid license to use certain trademarks, brand names and logos in marketing our products and services for five years after the completion of the HHI Business acquisition. The Company has amended the license agreement with SBD to extend the license agreement and allow for the continued use of the respective trademarks, brand names and logos in the HHI segment through December 2018. During this extension period, Spectrum will pay to SBD royalties based on a percentage of sales.
 ﻿
 We own or license from third parties a significant number of patents and patent applications throughout the world relating to products we sell and manufacturing equipment we use. Through our GBA segment, we hold a license that expires in March 2022 for certain alkaline battery designs, technology and manufacturing equipment from Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co., Ltd. (“Matsushita”), to whom we pay a royalty. Through ownership of Shaser, Inc., we have patented technology that is used in our i-Light and i-Light Reveal product line. Through our HHI segment, we own the patented SmartKey® technology, which enables customers to easily rekey their locks without hiring a locksmith. Through our acquisition of PetMatrix on June 1, 2017, we own patented technology for the development of edible rawhide-free pet treats. Through our acquisition of GloFish on May 12, 2017, we own patented technology used in the development and breeding of fluorescent ornamental fish.
 ﻿
 Research and Development
 ﻿
 Our research and development strategy is focused on new product development and performance enhancements of our existing products. We plan to continue to use our strong brand names, established customer relationships and significant research and development efforts to introduce innovative products that offer enhanced value to consumers through new designs and improved functionality. During the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we invested $59.5 million, $58.7 million and $51.3 million, respectively, in product research and development.
 ﻿
 Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters
 ﻿
 Due to the nature of our operations, our facilities are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign legal and regulatory provisions relating to the environment, including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances at our facilities. We believe that compliance with the federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations to which we are subject will not have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, financial condition, earnings or competitive position.
 ﻿
 From time to time, we have been required to address the effect of historic activities on the environmental condition of our properties. We have not conducted invasive testing at all facilities to identify all potential environmental liability risks. Given the age of our facilities and the nature of our operations, it is possible that material liabilities may arise in the future in connection with our current or former facilities. If previously unknown contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our manufacturing facilities is discovered, we could incur material unforeseen expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. Although we are currently engaged in investigative or remedial projects at some of our facilities, we do not expect that such projects, taking into account established accruals, will cause us to incur expenditures that are material to our business, financial condition or results of operations; however, it is possible that our future liability could be material.
 ﻿


 
14


 


 We have been, and in the future may be, subject to proceedings related to our disposal of industrial and hazardous material at off-site disposal locations or similar disposals made by other parties for which we are held responsible as a result of our relationships with such other parties. In the U.S., these proceedings are under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) or similar state laws that hold persons who “arranged for” the disposal or treatment of such substances strictly liable for costs incurred in responding to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances from such sites, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original disposal. Liability under CERCLA is typically joint and several, meaning that a liable party may be responsible for all costs incurred in investigating and remediating contamination at a site. As a practical matter, liability at CERCLA sites is shared by all of the viable responsible parties. We occasionally are identified by federal or state governmental agencies as being a potentially responsible party for response actions contemplated at an off-site facility. At the existing sites where we have been notified of our status as a potentially responsible party, it is either premature to determine whether our potential liability, if any, will be material or we do not believe that our liability, if any, will be material. We may be named as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or similar state laws for other sites not currently known to us, and the costs and liabilities associated with these sites may be material.
 ﻿
 It is difficult to quantify with certainty the potential financial impact of actions regarding expenditures for environmental matters, particularly remediation, and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment. See Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere within the Annual Report for further discussion on estimated liabilities arising from such environmental matters. Nevertheless, based upon the information currently available, we believe that our ultimate liability arising from such environmental matters should not be material to our business or financial condition.

 Electronic and electrical products that we sell in Europe, particularly products sold under the Remington® brand name, VARTA® battery chargers, certain portable lighting and all of our batteries, are subject to regulation in European Union (“EU”) markets under three key EU directives. The first directive is the Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) which took effect in EU member states beginning July 1, 2006. RoHS prohibits companies from selling products which contain certain specified hazardous materials in EU member states. We believe that compliance with RoHS does not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial condition, earnings or competitive position. The second directive is entitled the Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”). WEEE makes producers or importers of particular classes of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. WEEE assigns levels of responsibility to companies doing business in EU markets based on their relative market share. WEEE calls on each EU member state to enact enabling legislation to implement the directive. To comply with WEEE requirements, we have partnered with other companies to create a comprehensive collection, treatment, disposal and recycling program. As EU member states pass enabling legislation we currently expect our compliance system to be sufficient to meet such requirements. Our current estimated costs associated with compliance with WEEE are not significant based on our current market share. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of the WEEE legislation and implementing regulations as EU member states implement guidance and as our market share changes and, as a result, actual costs to our company could differ from our current estimates and may be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. The third directive is the Directive on Batteries and Accumulators and Waste Batteries, which was adopted in September 2006 and went into effect in September 2008 (the “Battery Directive”). The Battery Directive bans heavy metals in batteries by establishing maximum quantities of those heavy metals in batteries and mandates waste management of batteries, including collection, recycling and disposal systems. The Battery Directive places the costs of such waste management systems on producers and importers of batteries. The Battery Directive calls on each EU member state to enact enabling legislation to implement the directive. We currently believe that compliance with the Battery Directive does not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial condition, earnings or competitive position. EU member states have adopted enabling legislation required by the directive and issued additional guidance. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the Battery Directive and its enabling legislation.

 Certain of our products and facilities in each of our business segments are regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) or other federal consumer protection and product safety agencies and are subject to the regulations such agencies enforce, as well as by similar state, foreign and multinational agencies and regulations. For example, in the U.S., all products containing pesticides must be registered with the EPA and, in many cases, similar state and foreign agencies before they can be manufactured or sold. Our inability to obtain, delay in receipt or the cancellation of any registration could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The severity of the effect would depend on which products were involved, whether another product could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected. We attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of, and access to, substitute chemicals and other ingredients. We may not always be able to avoid or minimize these risks.
 ﻿
 The Food Quality Protection Act (“FQPA”) established a standard for food-use pesticides, which is that a reasonable certainty of no harm will result from the cumulative effect of pesticide exposures. Under the FQPA, the EPA is evaluating the cumulative effects from dietary and non-dietary exposures to pesticides. The pesticides in certain of our products continue to be evaluated by the EPA as part of this program. It is possible that the EPA or a third party active ingredient registrant may decide that a pesticide we use in our products will be limited or made unavailable to us. We cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of the EPA’s continuing evaluations of active ingredients used in our products.

 Certain of our products and packaging materials are subject to regulations administered by the FDA. Among other things, the FDA enforces statutory prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated products, establishes ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain products, establishes standards of identity for certain products, determines the safety of products and establishes labeling standards and requirements. In addition, various states regulate these products by enforcing federal and state standards of identity for selected products, grading products, inspecting production facilities and imposing their own labeling requirements.    ﻿
 Certain A/C products containing R-134a are subject to regulation in the U.S. markets under the EPA’s Significant New Alternative Policy (“SNAP Program”), which implements international agreements restricting the use of certain refrigerants. The EPA has identified use of R-134a in new automotive air conditioning systems as an approved use up to the 2020 automotive model year. The EPA has not yet approved a replacement refrigerant under the SNAP program for sale in small cans for automotive use for automobiles produced beginning with the 2021 model year, and future rulemakings from the agency are anticipated. In addition, in 2017 the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a decision that may remove R-134a from regulation under the SNAP program, and that decision may be subject to en banc review or a writ of certiorari filed with the U.S. Supreme Court. We currently believe that compliance with current and future SNAP regulations will not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial condition, earnings or competitive position. However, until such time as future regulations are issued and future alternate refrigerants are approved for sale in small cans, a full evaluation of these costs cannot be completed. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the SNAP Program as the EPA issues additional guidance.
 ﻿
 The fish sold under the GloFish brand can be classified as an intragenic or transgenic species due to the addition of their bioluminescent genes, which means the FDA has the authority to regulate as the luminescence is caused by intentional altered genomic DNA. Additional regulatory agencies, including the EPA, as well as agencies in U.S. and foreign states have authority to regulate these types of species. It is possible that EPA, FDA, or another U.S. or foreign state or federal agency could in the future seek to exercise authority over the distribution and/or sale of GloFish. We will continue to monitor the development of any regulations that might apply to our bioluminescent fish.
 ﻿
 Certain of our products may be regulated under programs within the United States, Canada, or in other countries that may require that those products and the associated product packaging be recycled or managed for disposal through a designated recycling program. Some programs are funded through assessment of a fee on the manufacturer and suppliers, including Spectrum Brands. We do not expect that such programs will cause us to incur expenditures that are material to our business, financial condition or results of operations; however, it is possible that our future liability could be material.
 ﻿
 The United States Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) was amended in 2016, and the EPA is currently evaluating additional chemicals for regulation under that amended law. Certain of our products may be manufactured using chemicals or other ingredients that may be subject to regulation under current TSCA regulations, and other chemicals or ingredients may be regulated under the law in the future. We do not expect that compliance with current or future TSCA regulations will cause us to incur expenditures that are material to our business, financial condition or results of operations; however, it is possible that our future liability could be material.

 Employees
 ﻿
 We have approximately 16,800 full-time employees worldwide as of September 30, 2017. Approximately 14% of our total labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements. There are 8 collective bargaining agreements that will expire during our fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, which cover approximately 74% of the labor force under collective bargaining agreements, or approximately 10% of our total labor force. We believe that our overall relationship with our employees is good.
