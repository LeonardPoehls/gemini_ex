Item 1. Business
Overview 
We are a leading provider of cloud-based ecommerce fulfillment and marketing solutions for large retailers, marketplaces, consumer brands and their suppliers. Our solutions help our customers implement strategies to increase their ecommerce revenues and create meaningful operational efficiencies within their supply chains. Our customers use our cloud-based software and service capabilities, which are tailored for specific customer business rules and processes, to more effectively fulfill consumer orders, generate consumer demand for their products and deliver those products to consumers. 
Since the beginning of ecommerce, retailers and brands have faced significant financial and operational difficulties transitioning their businesses to digital environments. For example, retailers have been challenged by the task of providing their customers with the large selection of products that they expect and increasingly demand. Buying larger assortments of products from suppliers and storing them in inventory requires significant capital investment for retailers. Similarly, operating warehouses equipped with the capabilities needed to receive and prepare orders for shipment is complex and expensive. CommerceHub helps to solve these problems by helping retailers leverage the "virtual inventory" of thousands of suppliers. Through CommerceHub’s platform, retailers and suppliers can share product information and inventory data, and process customer orders that are drop-shipped with the retailer's branding and delivery speed promises. In addition, by connecting with our large network of retailers and other demand channels, brands and suppliers are able to proactively unlock new sources of demand for their products. For example, rather than relying exclusively on their legacy wholesale relationships and the consumer demand generated by their own websites, brands are able to extend their reach by selling through additional retailers and online marketplaces, such as Amazon and eBay.
We provide our solutions to our customers through two offerings that are delivered through our cloud-based CommerceHub software platform and complementary services. 
CommerceHub for Retailers. Retailers and online marketplaces use CommerceHub to increase their online revenue through an “asset-light” fulfillment strategy called drop-shipping, where products are sold online by a retailer and then drop-shipped directly to a retailer’s customer by the supplier. Our platform enables retailers to expand their product offerings without the economic and logistical limitations and risks typically associated with buying, storing and shipping physical inventory. Our network of over 11,000 drop-ship-capable suppliers are able to receive orders from retailers and rapidly deliver products directly to consumers.
CommerceHub for Brands. Brands and other marketplace sellers use CommerceHub to grow their online revenue by selling their products through retailers and marketplaces. Our platform gives brands and other sellers greater exposure to consumer demand through access to, and product listing management capabilities for, many of the largest and most important sales channels in North America, including major retailers, online marketplaces and other demand channels, such as social and product advertising.
A core set of software and service capabilities underpin both our retailer and brand offerings. Our platform facilitates rapid, cost-efficient, on-time delivery of products to consumers with greater control of, and visibility into, the consumer experience through more dynamic and intelligent use of third-party logistics (“3PL”) providers and national, regional, local and specialty delivery companies. For example, our SmartShipping solution enables retailers to automatically adjust carrier service levels to help meet consumer delivery promise dates in the most cost-effective manner available based on the geographical location of the inventory and the consumer. To help reduce delivery times, our network of 3PL partners helps retailers and other sellers distribute inventory to locations that are closer to a wider distribution of their customers, enabling them to meet their customers' delivery expectations while reducing the associated delivery costs.
Complementing the software capabilities common to our retailer and brand offerings, our customers form a collective trading partner network where retailers, marketplaces, brands and their suppliers are able to conduct business with each other through the CommerceHub platform. Each trading partner on the network is able to integrate to CommerceHub using file formats and messages native to their own internal information systems, and CommerceHub acts as a centralized integration hub that translates individual messages into the format required by each of their trading partner's disparate systems. This approach is effective at reducing the overall cost and complexity of conducting business because each trading partner needs to manage only their integration to CommerceHub, instead of having to manage and maintain multiple integrations to the thousands of other trading partners also connected to CommerceHub. Additionally, the operational risk of transitioning an existing drop-ship supply chain to CommerceHub is reduced because over 11,000 brands and distributors are already connected to our network, and we have over 20 years of experience setting up and maintaining these integrations with significant operational efficiency.

Supply Chain Transformation from the Secular Shift of Retail Spending into Ecommerce
Consumers are increasingly shopping for products online using ecommerce channels such as online retailers and marketplaces because of convenience and large product selections. As consumer spending shifts into these online channels, retailers and brands are discovering that their existing supply chains are not set up to efficiently manage the order fulfillment process. Before ecommerce, retailer and brand supply chains were focused inward and were optimized to manage the physical assets owned and managed by the retailer or brand. Coordination between trading partners took place through negotiated replenishment orders that arranged for the infrequent movement of large quantities of physical goods between parties. Warehouses owned and managed by retailers were designed to support receiving goods from brands and distributors, and shipping of goods to physical stores, in quantities that were batched into large bulk shipments. Conversely, warehouses owned and managed by brands and distributors were designed to receive goods from manufacturers and importers and to ship goods to retailers in bulk shipments. Only specialized catalog and TV-based retailers were adept at packaging single products into individual shipments to consumers at high volume. 
The rise of ecommerce has fundamentally transformed, and continues to transform, supply-chain design. As traditional retailers started to sell online, they retro-fitted a portion of their warehouses to enable direct-to-consumer fulfillment. However, the growth of ecommerce order volumes has proved too much for many retailers to handle on their own. Retail organizations have faced difficult strategic decisions on whether to invest significant amounts of financial and human capital to increase fulfillment capacity by building and stocking new warehouses, or to outsource those functions to their suppliers. In many cases, shifting inventory management and fulfillment responsibilities to suppliers has benefited both retailers and suppliers. Retailers have been able to increase revenues without corresponding increases in capital investments, and their suppliers, including brands and distributors, have been able to increase their own revenues because the retailers have been able to list more of their products for sale online. This approach, called drop-shipping, has fundamentally changed the way trading partners interact as their relationships, and the supply chains built to support those relationships, have moved from low-volume replenishment orders to high-volume drop-ship orders. 
The current landscape of global ecommerce requires sellers to integrate their supply chains and information systems to a variety of third parties, including retailers, online marketplaces, search engines and fulfillment sources, such as brands, distributors and 3PL providers. The relationships retailers and brands have with third parties form a network of distributed commerce where each party acts as a trading partner playing a role to support the business of other trading partners. Through CommerceHub, our customers are able to integrate their systems to our software platform to extend the reach and capability of their supply chains to include the capabilities of their other trading partners. 
Software Platform and Trading Partner Network
Our customers include over 11,600 retailers, online marketplaces, brands and other suppliers that use our platform every day to conduct business with each other, including processing orders and invoices, exchanging product information and other electronic documents, and tracking their customers’ buying experience from order through fulfillment and delivery. Our customers include many of North America’s largest retailers and brands, who use CommerceHub to generate consumer demand, fulfill customer orders and facilitate the delivery of products to customers. We estimate that, in 2017, our customers used CommerceHub to enable the fulfillment of goods worth an estimated $16 billion in gross merchandise value ("GMV"). As described in more detail below under "—Our Revenue," the majority of our revenue is variable and tied to order fees that are primarily based on the volume of customer activity we enable on our platform.
Collectively, our customers and the other trading partners on our platform comprise a vast network of retailers, brands, other suppliers, online marketplaces, demand channels and other trading partners that constitute a critical mass of many of the largest and most influential companies in North American ecommerce. This critical mass has helped us achieve a meaningful network effect, attracting new brand customers to our large network of retailers and demand channels, and attracting new retailer and demand channel customers to our network of thousands of suppliers, enabling us to grow our business with a comparatively low cost of customer acquisition.
Our Growth Strategy
In any given year, the majority of our revenue tends to come from our existing customers, and we structure our customer relationships so that the majority of our revenue is earned through order fees, which are primarily driven by the volume of customer activity on our platform. We believe there are three distinct drivers of volume growth on our platform. First is the secular shift of retail into the ecommerce channel, which has provided a natural tailwind for us where activity on our platform (and thus, our revenue) has increased as more consumers shop online. Next is our ability to increase the share of our customers’ overall ecommerce GMV that is transacted through our platform, which we refer to as our “GMV share.” When we increase our GMV share with customers, we achieve additional volume growth in excess of the organic growth rate of those customers. Finally, we have the ability to sign new retailer and brand customers, which provides additional revenue through 
2

setup and professional services fees, subscription fees and, as these new customers ramp up their adoption of our platform, order fees. Today, the majority of our customers are located in the United States and Canada. In 2017, we signed our first retailer customer in the United Kingdom, and we believe this was an initial step toward growing revenue through the signing of European retailer customers.
In addition, we seek to increase our revenue through a combination of upselling new software features and cross-selling opportunities with our existing customers. These opportunities include:

• | expanding the number of retailer-to-supplier connections within our existing customer base;


• | leveraging our expansive trading partner network of retailer and marketplace customers to attract new brands and other suppliers, and leveraging our expansive network of suppliers to attract new retailer and marketplace customers;


• | enabling our existing customers to more easily sell and promote their product assortments through newly emerging ecommerce channels, such as social networks; and


• | continuing to develop new and innovative solutions and features that help our customers capture a larger share of the growing ecommerce market to further increase the volume of ecommerce transactions processed through our platform.

Our Role as Strategic Partner
CommerceHub is generally viewed as a "mission critical" partner to our customers. Our solutions address some of the most important issues facing online sellers today. Retailers and brands that sell direct-to-consumer face a challenging market environment characterized by flat-to-declining retail store sales, more demanding consumer expectations in terms of product availability and delivery, and the proliferation of emerging search and social ecommerce channels to convert sales. Our platform and solutions enable our customers to meet these market challenges and more efficiently grow their online sales.
We have a long history of successfully helping our customers reduce the overall complexity of their trading partner relationships to help them grow their revenue through ecommerce in a capital-efficient manner. In addition, our solutions help our customers grow their online sales by facilitating more rapid fulfillment of orders and enabling them to capture more consumer demand through online marketplaces, social and product advertising and other demand channels. Many of our retailer and marketplace customers use our solutions to enable a large percentage of their overall online sales, and our brand and other supplier customers use our solutions to tap into direct-to-consumer demand. In each case, our solutions help our customers better coordinate and manage their fulfillment and delivery capabilities with greater visibility to ensure a positive consumer experience. We believe that this combination of "supply" (enabling the fulfillment of consumer orders through a network of suppliers), "demand" (connecting sellers to consumer demand by facilitating access to demand channels) and "delivery" (facilitating rapid, cost-efficient, on-time delivery to consumers) solutions is unique in our industry and provides us with a compelling platform to continue to successfully grow our business.
Because our solutions play a critical role in helping our customers manage a complex array of business relationships in a highly competitive retail environment, we have benefited from strong loyalty and enduring, long-term relationships with many of our customers. We believe we are becoming an increasingly strategic partner to our customers as we become more deeply integrated into their systems and go-to-market efforts, as our GMV share increases, and as more retailers, marketplaces, brands and suppliers connect into the CommerceHub platform.
We also enhance our platform through value-added capabilities that we continue to develop, many of which are based on feedback we receive from our customers about challenges they face in their ecommerce businesses. For example, the following capabilities solve unique issues related to virtual inventory fulfillment:

• | managing high drop-ship order volumes with multiple parties: each order a retailer receives must be managed with at least one third-party supplier that fulfills the order on the retailer's behalf, which is more complex than traditional direct fulfillment, as the retailer is entrusting an important part of the customer experience to an outsourced supplier, and this complexity increases exponentially when scaled across large retailer supplier networks and transaction volumes;


• | retailer branding requirements: retailers frequently want the multi-party drop-ship fulfillment process be invisible to the consumer, which requires that third-party suppliers include retailer-branded packing slips and other materials in shipments to consumers;


• | insight, analytics and proactive error resolution: retailers must monitor and track a high volume of drop-ship orders and identify shipments that are at risk of missing the consumer's delivery promise date; and


• | coordination with third-party logistics providers: our ability to integrate with 3PL providers enables retailers and suppliers to locate inventory closer to broad distributions of consumers, helping them to increase delivery speeds and reduce delivery costs.

3


• | product content collection and compliance: before retailers can sell products online, they must collect detailed digital product information from their suppliers, including descriptions, titles, prices and images. Suppliers maintain and manage product information in disparate databases and formats that are not compliant with retail-specific requirements. Our software provides retailers with the ability to more efficiently collect product information from suppliers and then transform their digital assets into a format that can be more easily imported into a retailer’s own information systems to reduce the time it takes to post products for sale online; and


• | ship-to-store and omnichannel capabilities: many brick and mortar retailers are relying heavily on omnichannel strategies that provide for more effective coordination between online and offline channels. Our ship-to-store capabilities enable retailers to drop ship products directly to specific physical retail store locations, providing consumers with more flexible and convenient delivery options.

Our Industry 
Ecommerce has grown significantly over the last several years as consumers have increasingly shifted retail purchases from traditional "brick-and-mortar" stores to online stores and marketplaces. This growth has been attributable to a number of factors, including:

• | the availability of a broader selection of merchandise online;


• | consumer convenience and ease of use;


• | more competitive and transparent pricing;


• | increased functionality and reliability of ecommerce websites;


• | the emergence of mobile-connected devices and specialized websites;


• | the proliferation of online distribution channels; and


• | the reduction in "brick-and-mortar" locations for many retailers.

As a result of these and other factors, consumers today have more options to discover, research and purchase products online. Although these ecommerce growth drivers create significant opportunity for sellers, they also create additional complexities and challenges. Retailers and brands seeking new avenues to expand their online sales must manage product data, transactions and delivery promises across hundreds of highly fragmented online channels with different requirements for conducting business, varying data attributes and other technical requirements, evolving business models and competitive pressure to increase the pace of innovation.
In addition to the shift toward ecommerce retailing, organic growth of the economy and consumer spending provides an additional tailwind. In this environment, well-run brick-and-mortar retailers have increasingly focused on optimizing the interplay between their physical and online storefronts. This omnichannel approach enables customers to shop and interact between channels in a more fluid manner. For example, shoppers can buy a product online but pick it up in-store, retailers can use their stores as warehouses, fulfilling online orders through in-store delivery or by shipping items from their stores, and shoppers can return products purchased online to in-store locations. An omnichannel strategy enables a retailer to position its physical storefront not as a liability, but rather as part of a strategy to provide consumers with a more consistent, convenient and effortless retail experience, regardless of how they choose to engage the retailer. As a result of their success, we believe that omnichannel strategies represent an increasingly significant component of all retailers' revenue mix.
Growth in ecommerce spending has consistently outpaced overall growth in retail sales, a trend that is expected to continue. Based on data from the U.S. Department of Commerce, ecommerce spending in the U.S. has grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 15% since 2010, exceeding $450 billion in 2017 when it amounted to approximately 8.9% of all retail sales. During the same period, total non-inflation adjusted retail sales, offline and online, grew at a compound annual rate of approximately 4.2%.
Ecommerce Fulfillment Industry Background
The ecommerce fulfillment industry enables thousands of retailers around the world to transact and grow their relationships with tens of thousands of suppliers. Additional participants in this market include 3PL providers, parcel carriers and other delivery companies, fulfillment and warehousing providers and sourcing companies. Supply chain management involves communicating data about the goods themselves, data related to the exchange of goods among these trading partners, and information about the many thousands of companies who are members of the supply chain community. At virtually every stage of the supply chain, there are inefficient, labor-intensive processes between trading partners with administrative and communication requirements, such as the exchange of product information between retailers and suppliers for the purpose of listing products for sale and verifying the status of goods before shipment, while in transit and upon delivery, to ensure that consumers receive the products they ordered by the date promised. Mistakes made during these processes negatively impact trading partners and their businesses, either through penalties that counterparties impose or through poor consumer experiences that discourage future purchases. Ecommerce fulfillment solutions must address trading partners' needs for integration, 
4

collaboration, connectivity, visibility and data analytics to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency with which goods are ordered and supplied.
The industry initially focused on electronically connecting retailers and suppliers over the Internet to avoid costly and error-prone manual, paper and fax-based communication processes. The next evolution included automating and streamlining these fulfillment transactions between retailers, suppliers and others in the supply chain, ensuring orders were placed accurately and quickly and that goods were delivered on time and in accordance with the retailer's requirements. As familiarity and acceptance of cloud-based services continues to accelerate, we believe that ecommerce participants, both large and small, will continue to turn to cloud-based solutions such as ours for their supply chain integration needs.
Traditional Solutions
Traditional ecommerce fulfillment solutions implemented using on-premise licensed software tend to focus primarily on fulfillment automation within a single facility and among a small network of trading partners. On-premise software provides connectivity between only one organization and its trading partners and typically requires significant time and technical expertise to configure, deploy and maintain, and to accommodate new trading partners added to the network. On-premise software licensors primarily link retailers and suppliers through the Electronic Data Interchange, also known as "EDI," protocol, which enables the structured electronic transmission of data between organizations. Because of set-up and maintenance costs, technical complexity and a growing volume of requirements from retailers, the traditional software model is not well-suited for many retailers and suppliers, especially where the network includes small and medium-sized suppliers with disparate systems and smaller information technology budgets.
Additionally, the traditional approach to supply chain automation involves a system architecture made up of many point-to-point connections between retailers and their suppliers. These multiple connections are inherently error-prone and can be difficult to adapt to changing requirements and market circumstances. For instance, if there is a broad trend in the market that many members of a retailing segment would like to adopt, a supplier would be faced with a series of enhancements, on a one-by-one basis, to each connection they have with their retailer relationships. Lacking flexibility, adaptability and ability to scale, traditional approaches do not have the dynamic architectural capabilities necessary for retailers and suppliers to maximize the opportunities presented by the rapid evolution of market trends.
Expansion of Product Assortments
While online retailing has removed the shelf-space constraints placed on retailers wanting to offer a large product assortment to consumers, it has not removed the physical and operational constraints of storing products in inventory and picking, packing and shipping them to consumers quickly when they are ordered. In fact, the need to offer massive numbers of products for sale online has put more pressure on retailers to substantially increase capital investments in more expansive inventories and larger, more sophisticated warehouse and distribution operations. As an alternative to expensive product and infrastructure investment, however, retailers looking to increase the number of products they offer often turn to third-party fulfillment mechanisms, specifically drop-ship fulfillment, to expand their assortments through virtual inventory. With drop-shipping, a retailer is able to take a consumer's order and provide it to a supplier that then delivers the product directly to the consumer. The consumer perceives that the product was received directly from the retailer, even though the retailer never touched the ordered item.
Each retailer imposes unique specifications on their trading partners for electronically communicating supply chain information. These specifications set the standards for transmitting and acknowledging invoices, inventory reporting, purchase orders and shipping notices. Suppliers that transact with multiple retailers need to accommodate different specifications for each retailer, which often vary based on a retailer's size, industry and technological capabilities. Suppliers that fail to comply with a retailer's specifications risk errors with processing orders and compliance fines, and recurring performance issues may cause a retailer to discontinue its relationship with a supplier. As a result, suppliers are increasingly seeking out solutions to help them manage these challenges and improve their service levels with the retailers they supply.
Before a retailer can list a supplier's products on its website, it must import the supplier's product content data, transform that data into a format that the retailer's online storefront supports, and then enhance the data in a way that makes the product appear more compelling to consumers. This process includes rewriting product titles and descriptions, creating additional data attributes that describe the products, and manipulating product images to conform to the retailer's standards. All of this work falls under the responsibility of individual retailer and supplier employees, who frequently rely on general purpose software and tools, such as email and spreadsheets, to accomplish these tasks, resulting in labor-intensive and error-prone processes with no activity tracking or management capabilities. The inefficiency of this process directly impacts a retailer's financial performance by increasing the amount of time and resources required to list products for sale online, or by reducing the number of products a retailer is able to carry online due to capacity constraints resulting from the manual tasks. A similar 
5

exercise takes place in the context of an online marketplace, where sellers must list products for sale and describe them in a manner that conforms to the marketplace's requirements.
Driving Demand
Ecommerce is a large and global market that continues to expand. However, it is also an increasingly complex and fragmented market due to the hundreds of channels available to sellers and the rapid pace of change and innovation across those channels. Historically, a retailer or brand might have simply established an online storefront and used a basic paid search program to drive traffic to its website. Today, however, in order to gain consumers' attention in a more crowded and competitive online marketplace, many retailers and an increasing number of consumer brands sell their merchandise through an omnichannel strategy where each channel has its own rules, requirements and specifications. In addition, retailers and brands often seek to sell their products in multiple countries, each with its own local consumer preferences and behaviors.
The fragmentation and increasing complexity of ecommerce channels are placing greater demands on retailers and brands that seek to grow their online sales. These sellers need omnichannel solutions that enable them to integrate their product offerings and inventory across multiple online channels. Traditional solutions, however, typically suffer from several limitations. In-house solutions are often costly, slow to implement and difficult to keep current. External solutions are often too narrowly tailored or aimed at helping sellers manage a single online channel or single category of channels rather than multiple platforms in a unified approach.
Delivering Products
From the consumer's perspective, an ecommerce transaction is not complete until the ordered products arrive at their doorstep. There is room for error in even the simplest fulfillment process, where a retailer is operating a single distribution facility with a small inventory of products, and the complexity of having a large network of third-party drop-ship suppliers and third-party fulfillment providers significantly increases the likelihood of error. Instead of managing a single distribution facility, a retailer must ensure that hundreds, and potentially thousands, of third-party suppliers are shipping the correct product to the correct consumer address and that the product will arrive at the consumer's doorstep by the date the retailer promised. Every ecommerce order must be split into its component "line items" and transmitted to the relevant supplier, which must then select the appropriate carrier service level to meet the delivery promise date. Unless the retailer is able to manage this process across its network of suppliers, the retailer risks uncontrolled costs as each supplier makes its own shipping decisions and then charges back to the retailer the cost of delivery. The consequences of poor supplier network performance are even more significant, as the consumer will blame the retailer for any fulfillment problems caused by the third-party supplier or fulfillment provider, thus damaging the customer's perception of the retailer's brand.
Our Solutions and Capabilities 
Our solutions are designed to fulfill our product strategy of unifying disparate sources of demand, supply and delivery. Within our CommerceHub for Retailers and CommerceHub for Brands software and service offerings, our solutions help retailers, marketplaces, brands and suppliers reduce the complexity of selling products through online sales channels, including sourcing through multiple suppliers, selling on emerging online sales channels and delivering products to consumers. 
Beyond the cloud-based software required to build and operate successful ecommerce strategies, our solutions include highly targeted services that help our customers rapidly adopt and maximize the utility of our offerings. By combining our software with value-added services, we enable easier adoption of the most effective strategies and tactics for product merchandising, online marketing and product delivery.
Our solutions include:
Assortment Expansion through Drop-Ship Fulfillment.    The core CommerceHub solution enables our retailer customers to communicate electronically with their drop-ship suppliers through a single, integrated connection. Through this "virtual inventory" solution, retailers are able to link their order management systems to each supplier's system to exchange order processing data in compliant formats, allowing for better order and inventory coordination. By using our platform, retailers are able to communicate orders to their suppliers, view data indicating the inventory quantity each supplier has available, receive updates regarding the shipment of orders, view reports that describe each supplier's fulfillment performance and receive notifications when exceptions in the fulfillment process occur. Suppliers are able to receive and manage orders from multiple retailers through a web-based application (or a system-to-system connection for high-volume suppliers) and print retailer-branded packing slips for their shipments to consumers, all while complying with each retailer's unique and exacting requirements without needing to understand the retailer's underlying technical protocols. Retailers using our assortment expansion solution are able to compete more effectively in the market through the operation, at scale, of various delivery strategies, including drop-shipping, ship-to-store, in-store special orders and optimized delivery.

Our assortment expansion solutions include the following capabilities:

• | Distributed Inventory Management—Our inventory management capability enables retailers to receive aggregated and geographically identified inventory data feeds from a large network of suppliers. Instead of manually receiving and processing individual inventory feeds separately for each of their suppliers, our inventory management capability aggregates disparate inventory data files and provides the resulting output to the retailer in a transformed file format that can be imported directly into the retailer's inventory management software to provide an updated view of the products available for sale from its suppliers and to avoid listing out-of-stock products as available for sale. Including geographic location information in the inventory data feed enables retailers to select more efficient and cost-effective delivery methods, facilitating product shipment from warehouses that are closer to the delivery destination.


• | Compliance Management—Our compliance management capability tracks supplier delivery performance, which is then aggregated and presented to the retailer in the form of performance reports and supplier "scorecards." These scorecards provide a snapshot of each supplier's fulfillment performance, helping our retailer customers better manage and assess the performance of their supplier network. Retailers can also use this enhanced visibility to identify trends and address systemic issues across their supplier network to improve the consumer experience by increasing the pace and accuracy of order fulfilment. This capability also benefits suppliers by helping them improve performance and increase their volumes with retailers.


• | Returns Management—Our returns management capability helps retailers manage the process of accepting returns from consumers.


• | LTL and Special Order Management—Our "Less-Than-Truckload" ("LTL") shipping and special order capabilities provide detailed visibility and management tools to facilitate the fulfillment of complex orders that require the coordination of several parties, including third-party delivery agents and installers.


• | Product Content Collection, Management and Syndication—Our product content capabilities enable retailers to automate the process of communicating their product content specifications to suppliers and enable suppliers to more efficiently upload their product catalog into CommerceHub's cloud-based environment in a format that complies with the retailer's requirements, thereby reducing the time and effort required for retailers to list new products for sale. Through our cloud-based software, the retailer is able to efficiently collect and manipulate product content so that it meets the retailer's specifications and then export the compliant content to its website to expedite the process of adding products to their assortment.

Consumer Demand Generation.    Our demand channel solutions enable sellers to upload their entire product catalog to our platform and then transform and syndicate that product catalog to a wide array of ecommerce demand channels to facilitate consumer demand generation. Unlike competing solutions, our platform acts as the single source for a seller's entire product offering with the capability to transform product data into a format that is tailored to each demand channel's unique requirements. Instead of the time-consuming process of managing point-to-point integrations with online demand channels, sellers can upload their product catalog once and then create content rules that transform and map the data in a way that is optimized for each channel.
Our demand channel solutions facilitate multiple revenue-enhancing strategies for retailers and brands and include the following capabilities:

• | Cross-Channel Optimization for Online Marketplaces—Our channel optimization capabilities provide the ability for retailers and brands to sell through an array of online marketplaces, such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart Marketplace and Jet.com, while maintaining compliance with each marketplace's technical requirements. Sellers list the products they have for sale and provide price and inventory updates to the marketplace on an ongoing basis. When consumers buy products, our cloud-based software tracks the orders from the marketplaces to the seller for fulfillment.


• | Cross-Channel Optimization for Digital Advertising—Our channel optimization capabilities for digital advertising manage the listing and configuration of product advertisements on a variety of different ecommerce marketing channels, including Google and social networks such as Facebook and Pinterest. Leveraging the data provided by the product catalog capability of our demand channel solutions, the digital advertising capability enables sellers to optimize performance on supported ecommerce marketing channels by simplifying the process of managing a large number of online advertisement campaigns per channel. A seller that wants to create and manage hundreds of online advertisement campaigns on Google can significantly reduce their workload through one process, managed through our software, which uses content rules to replicate campaign configuration across hundreds of campaigns.

Enhanced Delivery Experience.    Our solutions for enhanced delivery experience help retailers and suppliers improve the efficiency of their consumer delivery networks through the application of algorithms that optimize shipping decisions and more effectively allocate physical product inventory across fulfillment locations.
Our solutions for enhanced delivery experience include the following capabilities:

• | Shipping Optimization—Our shipping optimization capability enables retailers to use efficient algorithms to make shipping decisions that help our retailer customers reduce costs and delivery times and meet consumer promise dates. For example, retailers can use our solutions to automatically downgrade a shipment from the two-day priority service level to the more cost-effective ground service level if shipment via ground will meet the consumer's delivery promise date. Alternatively, a retailer can upgrade the service level of shipments that are at risk of arriving to the consumer late, based on the geographic location of the consumer, the supplier shipping the product and the date by which the consumer was promised delivery.


• | Integrated Third-Party Logistics Providers—Our integrated 3PL capability enables retailers and suppliers to partner with 3PL providers and place physical inventory in warehouses located closer to a broader distribution of consumers. These integrated 3PL providers are then able to act as suppliers to the retailer or supplier and ship products to consumers that are located near the 3PL providers' facilities, which reduces delivery costs and increases delivery speeds.

Our Revenue
Our revenue primarily consists of fees charged to retailers and suppliers utilizing our CommerceHub for Retailers and CommerceHub for Brands offerings, including use of our drop-ship and demand channel solutions. Our “core drop-ship revenue” represents retailer, supplier and brand revenue derived from our customer relationships with retailers and includes order fees, subscription and other platform fees and set-up and professional services fees. Our revenue also consists of fees charged to consumer brands, distributors, retailers and other marketplace sellers using our demand channel and related solutions, which we refer to as "demand channel revenue."
Order fee revenue accounted for 54% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 and is attributable to fees charged to retailers and suppliers based on the volume of consumer orders processed through our platform using our drop-ship solutions. We charge these fees on a per-order basis, or pursuant to minimum order commitments required to be maintained by a customer under their contract with us. Order fee revenue grows as the overall volume of goods purchased online through our retailer customers increases. We track and measure order fee revenue because it corresponds to our customers' drop-ship activity on our platform.
Subscription and other platform revenue accounted for 32% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 and is attributable to subscription fees charged to retailers and suppliers for the use of our drop-ship solutions. A customer's subscription and other platform fees are based on several factors, including, for example, the number and type of trading partners that a customer is connected to through our platform and the adoption of certain available feature upgrades that enhance the functionality of our platform. Subscription and other platform revenue tends to grow as new customers join the platform, connect to and create new relationships with other trading partners, adopt new features and upgrades, and ramp up their activity on the platform. Subscription and other platform revenue also includes other drop-ship platform fees for activity related to our delivery-related solutions, inventory management, third-party communication capabilities and other platform activities related to ecommerce relationships. We track and measure subscription and other platform revenue because it provides insight into the size and scope of our platform in terms of total trading partner customers, relationships among those customers and the extent of their engagement with our platform.
Set-up and professional services revenue accounted for 6% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 and includes fees for the configuration, design and set-up of a customer's onboarding to our drop-ship solution and other services that we provide to new and existing customers on our drop-ship solution, including highly targeted services that are focused on helping our customers to more quickly adopt our drop-ship solutions and maximize their utility. We track and measure set-up and professional services revenue as it is an indication of new trading partner connections, enhancements to existing customer connections and the extent of customers' engagement with our platform's capabilities. 
Demand channel revenue accounted for 8% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 and includes set-up, professional services, subscription fees and other fees related to the volume of online sales and orders that retailers, sellers and brands achieve using our demand channel solutions. We track and measure demand channel revenue because it represents our customers' engagement and success with our demand channel solutions.
Our revenue is currently generated primarily from the United States and Canada. For financial information related to the geographic areas in which we do business, see Note 2 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements.

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in any of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015. However, our revenue model is primarily based on retailer and supplier program relationships whereby many revenue-generating supplier transactions conducted through our platform may be attributable to a single retailer ("Total Program Revenue"). For the year ended December 31, 2017, there were seven customers with Total Program Revenue that accounted for more than 5% each of our total revenue, two of which had Total Program Revenue that accounted for between 10% and 15% each of our total revenue.
Seasonality
Ecommerce is affected by the same seasonality as traditional brick-and-mortar retail, and many of our customers typically realize a significant portion of their sales in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. Although our customers do not all experience the same seasonal variation, and some customers may have seasonal peaks that occur in periods other than the fourth quarter, the seasonality of our customers' businesses impacts our financial results and may become more concentrated as we continue to expand our solutions to more customers. If our customer base changes to include more customers that experience more concentrated seasonal variation, our revenue may fluctuate significantly among quarters. Historically, the percentage of our annual revenue has been relatively uniform over the first three quarters of the year with approximately 33% to 34% of our annual revenue being generated in the fourth quarter.
Regulatory Matters
General
Various laws and regulations in the United States and foreign countries apply, both directly and indirectly, to our business, including laws and regulations regarding privacy, online commerce and communications, taxation, intellectual property and the provision of goods and services through the Internet. U.S. and foreign laws and regulations are subject to the actions of a range of governing and legislative bodies and regulatory entities and to the interpretations of a range of courts, making their application to our business uncertain and subject to change.
Data Privacy and Security
We are subject to laws governing the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information about our customers. The enactment, interpretation and application of user data protection and privacy laws are in a state of flux, and the interpretation and application of such laws may vary from country to country. For example, in 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union ("EU") invalidated the "Safe Harbor Framework," which had allowed companies to collect and process personal data in EU nations for use in the United States. In August 2016, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, a new data transfer framework agreed upon by EU and U.S. authorities, became fully operational. However, the validity of Privacy Shield framework has been challenged in EU courts, and the long-term viability of the Privacy Shield remains uncertain. In addition, the European Commission proposed new regulations regarding privacy and electronic communications in 2017, including additional regulation of the Internet tracking tools known as “cookies.” Finally, the new European General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") will take effect in May 2018. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the EU that are different than those currently in place in the EU, and will include significant penalties for non-compliance.
     In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has released a privacy policy framework and principles and has called for federal legislation to require organizations that suffer a breach of security related to personal information to provide notice of such breach. In the absence of federal legislation, most states and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have adopted laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach affecting personal data. Complying with differing national and state requirements may cause our business to incur substantial costs. In addition, online commerce businesses such as ours have publicly available privacy policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data. A failure to adequately disclose all relevant company data collection and usage practices in such privacy policies, or to comply with such privacy policies or with the requirements of federal, state or foreign privacy laws, could result in proceedings or actions by governmental agencies or others (such as class action litigation), which could adversely affect our business. Technical violations of certain privacy laws can result in significant penalties, including statutory penalties. In 2012, the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") amended its regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the "TCPA"), which could subject our business to increased liability for certain telephonic communications with customers, including but not limited to text messages to mobile phones. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek recovery for actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble such damage awards for willful or knowing violations. Data collection, privacy and security continue to be significant and growing public concerns. Congress and individual states and foreign legislative bodies may consider additional online privacy legislation.

Online Commerce
Our business also must comply with other federal, state and foreign laws, rules and regulations regarding online communications and commerce to the extent applicable to our business. For example, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act prohibits web sites directed at children under the age of 13 from collecting personally identifiable information online from such children without parental consent and imposes a number of operational requirements. Certain email activities are subject to the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, commonly known as the "CAN-SPAM" Act. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates the sending of unsolicited commercial email by requiring the email sender, among other things, to comply with specific disclosure requirements and to provide an "opt-out" mechanism for recipients. Both of these laws include statutory penalties for non-compliance. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act limits, but does not eliminate, liability for listing or linking to third-party websites that may include content that infringes on copyrights or other rights so long as our business complies with the statutory requirements. Various U.S. states also have adopted laws regulating certain aspects of Internet communications, websites, marketing and online commerce. Federal legislation enacted in 2016 permanently extended the moratorium on state and local taxes on Internet access and commerce. The EU has enacted a variety of Directives (separately implemented by each EU member state via local legislation) and Regulations (directly applicable to all EU member states) relating to online commerce, including Directive 2000/31/EC on Electronic Commerce, Directive 2011/83/EU on Consumer Rights, and the GDPR.
Additional Internet-related laws, rules and regulations may be adopted in the future on issues such as emerging commerce technologies and marketing approaches, Internet access, cross-border online transactions, defamatory speech, copyright infringement, pricing and characteristics and quality of products and services. Such additional laws or regulations may slow the growth of ecommerce services and the Internet, which could in turn cause a decline in the demand for our customers' online commerce business, and increase our cost (or our customers' cost) of doing business or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Moreover, the applicability of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, personal privacy and taxation to commercial online services and the Internet is uncertain and could expose our business to substantial liability.
In 2015, the FCC adopted rules in its open Internet proceeding that restricted the ability of broadband providers to block or otherwise disadvantage our business. Among other things, the open Internet (or "net neutrality") rules prohibited Internet service providers from: (1) blocking access to, or impairing or degrading, legal content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; and (2) favoring selected Internet traffic. On December 14, 2017, the FCC adopted a Declaratory Ruling, Report and Order, and Order (the “2017 Order”) that, among other things, eliminates these prohibitions. The 2017 Order does require Internet service providers to disclose information to consumers regarding practices such as throttling, paid prioritization and affiliated prioritization. We expect that various parties will challenge the 2017 Order in court and at the FCC. Legislative proposals regarding the open Internet rules also are pending in Congress.
Proposed Changes in Law and Regulation
The regulation of Internet services and access, privacy, data protection, ecommerce and related matters is subject to the political process, has been in constant flux over the past decade and is expected to remain in flux. Further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated, and there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by future legislation, regulation or deregulation.
Intellectual Property 
We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology, our software code, our performance data and our brand. Certain of our intellectual property rights have been acquired through third-party licenses and agreements. We protect our intellectual property by relying on confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, as well as on international, national, state and common law rights. In addition, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. We protect our brands through trademark registration of our core brands, maintenance of our trademark portfolio, contractual trademark rights protection and reliance on common law trademark rights. We also register copyrights and domain names as necessary.
Research and Development
For financial information related to our research and development activities, see the discussion of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 included in Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and see our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and the related notes included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Competition 
We compete with other SaaS providers servicing the ecommerce industry and with in-house developed solutions used by retailers that choose to build and maintain their own proprietary integrations to suppliers and online channels, using a combination of order management, custom written software and value-added networks. The competitive dynamics of our market are unpredictable because it is fragmented and rapidly evolving. Due to the nature of our business and the variety of products we offer, we do not believe there is any particular competitor or small group of competitors that compete with our business as a whole. Rather, our competitors vary by our solutions and offerings. 
We believe that there are several factors unique to our business that differentiate our solutions in the competitive marketplace, including:

• | the network effect of our existing connections and relationships with a diverse group of leading online retailers, suppliers, 3PL providers and other trading partners;


• | the fulfillment management capabilities of our solutions that enable retailers to operate large scale drop-ship fulfillment programs with a high degree of consumer satisfaction;


• | our history of long-term relationships with a blue-chip retailer customer base and our deep experience successfully serving and contributing to the growth of large retailers, which engenders trust in our capabilities as prospective retailers and suppliers consider engaging our services;


• | the breadth of our platform's existing integrations and support for a wide variety of online demand generation channels, including retailers and marketplaces;


• | our focus on data-quality software and services to structure product data in an optimized format for each online channel;


• | a history of establishing and maintaining reliable integration connections with our trading partners;


• | a proven, scalable technology with easy-to-use and accessible software and services;


• | our brand recognition and reputation in the markets in which we operate; and


• | the reliability and performance of our cloud-based software.

While no single competitor currently offers all of the solutions that we offer, we do have competitors with longer operating histories, larger customer bases and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, and if one or more of our competitors were to acquire, merge with or partner with another of our competitors, our ability to compete effectively could suffer. In addition, a number of competitive factors could cause us to lose potential sales or to sell our solutions at lower prices or at reduced margins. See Item 1A "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors" for more information.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 323 full-time and part-time employees, substantially all of whom are located in the United States. None of our employees were represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our employee relations are good.
Corporate History 
Our Company was founded in 1997 in Albany, New York by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Francis Poore, and our Chief Technology Officer, Richard Jones. It was acquired by an affiliate of Liberty Interactive Corporation, our former parent company ("Liberty"), in 2006 and became a subsidiary of Liberty in 2010.
During November 2015, the board of directors of Liberty authorized a plan to distribute shares of our Company to holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock (the "Spin-Off"). CommerceHub, Inc. was a newly formed Delaware corporation that, pursuant to an internal restructuring, effective July 21, 2016, became the parent company of Commerce Technologies, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that, as a result of the restructuring, is the successor to Commerce Technologies, Inc. ("CTI"), the entity through which CommerceHub transacted prior to the Spin-Off. Following the completion of the Spin-Off on July 22, 2016, CommerceHub now operates as a stand-alone publicly traded company and neither Liberty nor CommerceHub has any stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. 
Our Series A and Series C common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on July 25, 2016 under the symbols "CHUBA" and "CHUBK," respectively, and our Series B common stock began trading on the OTC Markets on July 25, 2016 under the symbol “CHUBB.”
Our headquarters and principal executive offices are located at ZEN Building, 201 Fuller Road, 6th Floor, Albany, New York, 12203, and our telephone number is (518) 810-0700.
