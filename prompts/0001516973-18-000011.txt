Item 1. Business
Our Company
MTGE Investment Corp. (“MTGE”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”) was incorporated in Maryland on March 15, 2011 and commenced operations on August 9, 2011 following the completion of our initial public offering (“IPO”). We are externally managed by MTGE Management, LLC (our “Manager”), a wholly owned subsidiary of AGNC Investment Corp. (“AGNC”). Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “MTGE.”
We invest in, finance and manage a leveraged portfolio of real estate-related investments, which includes agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“agency RMBS”), non-agency securities, other mortgage-related investments and other real estate investments. Agency RMBS include residential mortgage pass-through certificates and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) structured from residential mortgage pass-through certificates for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a government-sponsored enterprise (“GSE”), such as Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), or by a U.S. Government agency, such as Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”). Non-agency securities include securities backed by residential mortgages that are not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency and credit risk transfer securities (“CRT”). Other mortgage-related investments may include mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”), commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”), prime and non-prime residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans and mortgage-related derivatives. Other real estate investments may include equity and debt investments in healthcare real estate, including skilled nursing, assisted living and independent living facilities, operated by third party operators.
We operate to qualify to be taxed as a (“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). As as REIT, we are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable income. So long as we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. Federal or state corporate taxes on our REIT taxable income to the extent that we distribute all of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders. It is our intention to distribute 100% of our taxable income, after application of available tax attributes, within the time limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may extend into the subsequent taxable year.
Investment Strategy
Our principal investment objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders through a combination of quarterly dividends and net asset value appreciation. In pursuing this objective, we rely on our Manager's expertise to construct and manage a diversified investment portfolio by identifying asset classes that, when properly financed and hedged, are selected to produce attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles, considering the risks associated with owning such investments. Specifically, our investment strategy is designed to:

• | manage an investment portfolio of real estate-related investments;


• | capitalize on discrepancies in relative market valuations for real estate-related investments;


• | manage financing, interest rate, prepayment, extension and credit risks;


• | provide regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders;


• | qualify as a REIT;


• | remain exempt from the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”);


• | generate attractive risk-adjusted returns; and


• | manage our net asset value risk within reasonable bands.

Targeted Investments
We invest in, finance and manage real estate-related investments, including agency RMBS, non-agency mortgage investments, other mortgage-related investments and other real estate investments, including those set forth in each of the following asset classes:
Agency Securities

• | Agency RMBS. Our primary agency securities investments consist of agency pass-through certificates representing interests in “pools” of mortgage loans secured by residential real property. Monthly payments of principal and interest made by the individual borrowers on the mortgage loans underlying the securities, which are guaranteed by 

 2

a GSE to holders of the securities, are in effect “passed through,” to the holders of the securities, after deducting guarantee and servicer fees. In general, mortgage pass-through certificates distribute cash flows from the underlying collateral on a pro rata basis among the holders of the securities. Holders of the securities also receive guarantor advances of principal and interest on delinquent loans in the mortgage pools. We also invest in agency CMOs, which are structured instruments representing interests in agency residential pass-through certificates, and interest-only, inverse interest-only and principal-only securities, which represent the right to receive a specified proportion of the contractual interest or principal flows of specific agency CMO securities.

• | To-Be-Announced Forward Contracts (“TBA”). TBAs are forward contracts to purchase or sell agency RMBS. TBA contracts specify the coupon rate, issuer, term, and face value of the bonds to be delivered, with the actual bonds to be delivered only identified shortly before the TBA settlement date.

Non-Agency Securities

• | Non-agency RMBS. Non-agency RMBS are securities issued by a private institution such as a commercial bank and are backed by residential mortgages, for which the payment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or government agency. As such, non-agency RMBS can carry a significantly higher level of credit exposure than agency RMBS. Non-agency RMBS may benefit from credit enhancement derived from structural elements, such as subordination, overcollateralization or insurance. We may purchase highly-rated instruments that benefit from credit enhancement or non-investment grade instruments that absorb credit risk. We focus primarily on non-agency RMBS where the underlying mortgages are secured by residential properties within the United States. Non-agency RMBS are backed by residential mortgages that can be prime mortgage or non-prime mortgage loans. 


• | CRT. CRT securities transfer a portion of the risk associated with credit losses incurred by pools of conventional residential mortgage loans from the GSEs and/or third parties to private investors. Unlike Agency RMBS, full repayment of the original principal balance of CRT securities is not guaranteed by a GSE or other third party; rather, “credit risk transfer” is achieved by writing down the outstanding principal balance of the CRT securities if credit losses on the related pool of loans exceed certain thresholds. By reducing the amount that issuers are obligated to repay to holders of CRT securities, they offset credit losses on the related pool of loans. 

Other Mortgage-Related Investments

• | CMBS. CMBS are securities that are structured utilizing collateral pools comprised of commercial mortgage loans. CMBS can be structured as pass-through securities, where the cash flows generated by the collateral pool are passed on pro rata to investors after netting servicer or other fees, or where cash flows are distributed to numerous classes of securities following a predetermined waterfall, which may give priority to selected classes while subordinating other classes. We may invest across the capital structure of these securities and focus on CMBS where underlying collateral is secured by commercial properties located within the United States. 


• | Mortgage servicing rights. MSR represent the right to service mortgage loans, which involves activities such as collecting mortgage payments, escrowing and paying taxes and insurance premiums, and forwarding principal and interest payments to the mortgage lender. In return for providing these services, the holder of an MSR is entitled to receive a servicing fee, typically specified as a percentage (expressed in basis points) of the serviced loan's unpaid principal balance. We may invest in MSR associated with either agency or non-agency mortgage loans. 


• | Mortgage-related derivatives. As part of our investment and risk management strategy, we may enter into derivative transactions as a method of enhancing our risk/return profile and/or hedging existing or emerging risks within our investment portfolio. These transactions may include, but are not limited to, buying or selling forward positions and credit default swaps. Our Manager's implementation of this strategy is based upon overall market conditions, the level of volatility in the mortgage market, the size of our investment portfolio and our qualification as a REIT. 


• | Other mortgage-related investments may also include mortgage REIT equity securities, residential and commercial mortgage loans, excess interest-only instruments and other investments that may arise as the mortgage market evolves.

Other Real Estate Investments
Our other real estate investments include equity investments in healthcare and other senior living facilities which are leased to or operated by third parties who conduct all business operations of the facilities and debt investments secured by such facilities. We would expect such facilities to consist of the following:

• | Skilled Nursing Facilities. Skilled nursing facilities (“SNF”) are licensed healthcare facilities that provide restorative, rehabilitative and nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at acute care hospitals. Treatment programs include physical, occupational, speech, respiratory and other therapies, including sub-acute clinical protocols such as wound care and intravenous drug treatment. Charges for these services are generally paid by a combination of government reimbursement and private sources. 


• | Assisted Living Facilities. Assisted living facilities (“ALF”) are licensed healthcare facilities that provide personal care services, support and housing for those who need help with activities of daily living, such as bathing, eating and dressing, yet require limited medical care. The programs and services may include transportation, social activities, exercise and fitness programs, beauty or barber shop access, hobby and craft activities, community excursions, meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents. These facilities are often in apartment-like buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments. Certain ALFs may offer higher levels of personal assistance for residents requiring memory care as a result of Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia. Levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations. 


• | Independent Living Facilities. Independent living facilities (“ILF”), also known as retirement communities or senior apartments, typically consist of entirely self-contained apartments, complete with their own kitchens, baths and individual living spaces, as well as parking for tenant vehicles. They are most often rented unfurnished, and generally can be personalized by the tenants, typically an individual or a couple over the age of 55. These facilities offer various services and amenities such as laundry, housekeeping, meal plans, exercise and wellness programs, transportation, social, cultural and recreational activities, on-site security and emergency response programs.

Active Portfolio Management Strategy
Our Manager employs an active management strategy on our behalf designed to achieve our principal objectives of generating attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders through a combination of quarterly dividends and net asset value appreciation. Our Manager selects investments based on its assessment of relative risk-return profiles and the ability to effectively hedge a portion of the investments' exposure to market risks. The composition of our portfolio will vary based on our Manager's view of prevailing market conditions and the availability of suitable investment, hedging and funding opportunities. As a result, we may experience investment gains or losses when we sell investments that we believe no longer provide attractive risk-adjusted returns, when we believe more attractive alternatives exist elsewhere, or when we believe it is prudent to reduce aggregate exposure or a particular type of risk embedded in the portfolio. We may also experience gains or losses from our hedging strategies or due to credit losses on our non-agency securities or other real estate related investments.
Financing Strategy
As part of our investment strategy, we use leverage in our investment portfolio to increase potential returns to our stockholders. We may finance our securities investments, subject to market conditions, through a combination of financing arrangements, including, but not limited to, repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities, securitizations, term financing facilities and dollar roll transactions. We finance our securities investments primarily by entering into master repurchase agreements. A repurchase transaction acts as a financing arrangement under which we effectively pledge our investment assets as collateral to secure a loan. Our borrowings pursuant to these repurchase transactions generally have maturities that range from 30 to 180 days, but may have maturities of fewer than 30 days or more than one year. Under our repurchase agreements, our financing rate typically tracks short term rates such as the one, three or six month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus or minus a fixed spread.
We seek to finance the acquisition of our healthcare real estate primarily through long term mortgage debt provided by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Department of Housing Development (“HUD”). We may also finance our healthcare properties through the use of shorter term secured debt or bridge-loan financing obtained from other lenders. 
Our leverage varies depending on market conditions, our portfolio composition and our Manager's assessment of risks and returns. We finance different asset classes through the most efficient means available for a particular asset class at any given time. Therefore, our overall leverage is highly dependent on our investment portfolio composition. We generally expect our 
 4

leverage to be within four to seven times the amount of our stockholders' equity. However, under certain market conditions, we may operate at leverage levels outside of this range for extended periods of time. 
We seek to diversify our funding exposure by entering into repurchase agreements with multiple counterparties. We had master repurchase agreements with 34 financial institutions as of December 31, 2017. The terms of our master repurchase agreements generally conform to the terms in the standard master repurchase agreement as published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (“SIFMA”) with respect to repayment, margin requirements and the segregation of all securities sold under the repurchase transaction. In addition, each lender may require that we include supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement. Typical supplemental terms and conditions include additional margin maintenance requirements, requirements that all controversies related to the repurchase agreement be litigated in a particular jurisdiction and cross default provisions. These provisions may differ for each lender and certain of these terms may not be determined until we engage in a specific repurchase transaction. 
We also finance the acquisition of agency RMBS by entering into TBA dollar roll transactions in which we would sell a TBA contract for current month settlement and simultaneously purchase a similar, but not identical, TBA contract for a forward settlement date. Prior to the forward settlement date, we may choose to roll the position to a later date by entering into an offsetting TBA position, net settling the paired off positions for cash, and simultaneously entering into a similar TBA contract for a later settlement date. In such transactions, the TBA contract purchased for a forward settlement date is priced at a discount to the TBA contract sold for settlement/pair off in the current month. This difference (or discount) is referred to as the “price drop.” The price drop is the economic equivalent of net interest carry income on the underlying agency RMBS over the roll period (interest income less implied financing cost) and is commonly referred to as “dollar roll income.” We recognize TBA contracts as derivative instruments on our consolidated financial statements at their net carrying value (fair value less the purchase price to be paid or received under the TBA contract). Consequently, dollar roll transactions represent a form of off-balance sheet financing. In evaluating our overall leverage at risk, our Manager considers both our on-balance and off-balance sheet financing.
Risk Management Strategy
We use a variety of strategies to reduce our exposure to market risks, including interest rate, prepayment, extension and credit risks to the extent that our Manager believes is prudent, taking into account our investment strategy, the cost of hedging transactions and our intention to qualify as a REIT. Our hedging strategies are generally not designed to protect our net asset value from “spread risk,” or “basis risk”, which is the risk that the yield differential between our investments and our hedges fluctuates. In addition, while we use interest rate swaps and other supplemental hedges to attempt to protect our net asset value against moves in interest rates, we may not hedge certain interest rate, prepayment or extension risks if we believe that bearing such risks enhances our return profile, or if the hedging transaction would negatively impact our REIT status.

• | Interest Rate Risk. The vast majority of our investments have fixed rates of interest and can have average expected lives in excess of five years. Because a majority of our funding costs fluctuate based on short-term interest rate indices, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), the net interest income that we earn on these leveraged investments can vary significantly along with changes in market interest rates. As such, we may experience reduced income, losses, or a significant reduction in our net asset value due to adverse interest rate movements. To attempt to mitigate a portion of such risk, we utilize certain hedging techniques to attempt to lock in a portion of the net spread between the interest we earn on our assets and the interest we pay on our financing. 

Additionally, because prepayments on residential mortgages generally accelerate when interest rates decrease and slow when interest rates increase, mortgage securities typically have “negative convexity.” In other words, certain mortgage securities in which we invest may increase in price more slowly than similar duration bonds, or even fall in value, as interest rates decline. Conversely, certain mortgage securities in which we invest may decrease in value more quickly than similar duration bonds as interest rates increase. To manage this risk, we monitor, among other things, the “duration gap” between our mortgage assets and our hedge portfolio as well as our convexity exposure. Duration is an estimate of the relative expected percentage change in market value of our mortgage assets or our hedge portfolio that would be caused by a parallel change in short and long-term interest rates. Convexity exposure relates to the way the duration of our mortgage assets or our hedge portfolio changes when the interest rate or prepayment environment changes. 
The value of our mortgage assets may also be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the shape of the yield curve or by changes in the market's expectation about the volatility of future interest rates. We analyze our exposure to non-parallel changes in interest rates and to changes in the market's expectation of future interest rate volatility and take actions to attempt to mitigate these risks.
 5


• | Prepayment Risk. Because residential borrowers have the option to prepay their mortgage loans at par at any time, we face the risk that we will experience a return of principal on our investments faster than anticipated. Prepayment risk generally increases when interest rates decline. In this scenario, our financial results may be adversely affected as we may have to reinvest that principal at lower yields. 


• | Extension Risk. Because residential borrowers have the option to make only scheduled payments on their mortgage loans, rather than prepay their mortgage loans, we face the risk that a return of capital on our investment will occur slower than anticipated. Extension risk generally increases when interest rates rise. In this scenario, our financial results may be adversely affected as we may have to finance our investments at potentially higher costs without the ability to reinvest principal into higher yielding securities because borrowers prepay their mortgages at a slower pace than originally expected. 


• | Credit Risk. We accept mortgage credit exposure at levels our Manager deems prudent within the context of our diversified investment strategy. Therefore, we may retain all or a portion of the credit risk on the loans underlying our non-agency RMBS, as well as any future investments in CMBS and individual residential and commercial mortgages. We seek to manage this risk through prudent asset selection, pre-acquisition due diligence, post-acquisition performance monitoring, and sale of assets where we identify negative credit trends. We may also manage credit risk with credit default swaps or other financial derivatives that our Manager believes are appropriate. 


• | Spread Risk. When the spread between the market yield on our investments and benchmark interest rates widens, our net asset value could decline if the value of our investments falls by more than the offsetting fair value increases on our hedging instruments, creating what we refer to as “spread risk” or “basis risk.” The spread risk associated with our agency and non-agency securities and the resulting fluctuations in the fair value of these securities can occur independent of changes in benchmark interest rates and may relate to other factors impacting the mortgage and fixed income markets, such as actual or anticipated monetary policy actions by the Federal Reserve (“the Fed”), market liquidity, or changes in required rates of return on different assets. Our strategies are generally not specifically designed to protect our net asset value from spread risk. 


• | Risks Related to Healthcare Real Estate Investments. Our healthcare real estate investments, including independent living facilities, are exposed to counterparty risk, including, for equity investments, the ongoing ability of the operator to satisfy its lease obligations, or for potential debt investments, the ongoing ability of the borrower (the facility owner) to make principal and interest payments. As such, our healthcare real estate investments are heavily dependent upon the successful operation of the facilities by our counterparties. These operations may be impacted by factors specific to the healthcare sector, including, but not limited to, regulatory changes, government reimbursement reductions and revisions to licensure or certification requirements. Additionally, healthcare real estate is relatively illiquid, generally cannot be sold quickly and may be subject to impairment charges based on factors such as market conditions and operator performance. We seek to manage these risks through detailed pre-transaction due diligence of target properties and associated operators, prudent asset selection, and active post-acquisition monitoring. 

The principal instruments that we use to hedge a portion of our exposure to interest rate, prepayment and extension risks are interest rate swaps, options to enter into interest rate swaps (“swaptions”), U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts. We also use TBA forward contracts to periodically reduce our exposure to Agency RMBS.
Our hedging instruments are generally not designed to protect our net asset value from spread risk. Consequently, while we use interest rate swaps and other supplemental hedges to attempt to protect our net asset value against moves in interest rates, such instruments typically will not protect our net asset value against spread risk and, therefore, our net asset value could decline.
While our risk management strategy has the objective of maintaining attractive levels of earnings and dividends over the long term, the actions we take may lower our earnings and dividends in the short term. In addition, some of our hedges are intended to provide protection against larger rate moves and as a result may be relatively ineffective for smaller changes in interest rates. 
Income from hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk may not constitute qualifying gross income under one or both of the gross income tests applicable to REITs. Therefore, we may have to limit our use of certain hedging techniques, which could expose us to greater risks than we would otherwise want to bear, or implement those hedging techniques through a 
 6

taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”). Implementing our hedges through a TRS could increase the cost of our hedging activities because a TRS would be subject to tax on income and gains.
Our Manager
Pursuant to the terms of a management agreement, our Manager is responsible for administering our business activities and day-to-day operations, subject to the supervision and oversight of our Board of Directors. All of our officers, the members of our investment team and other support personnel, other than employees of Residential Credit Solutions, Inc. (“RCS”), are employees of the parent company of our Manager.
The management agreement has a current renewal term through August 9, 2018 and automatic one-year extension options thereafter. The management agreement may be terminated by us without cause, as defined in the management agreement, upon 90 days’ prior written notice to the Manager. Our Manager may terminate the management agreement without cause, as defined in the management agreement, after the completion of the current renewal term, or the expiration of any automatic subsequent renewal term, provided that our Manager provides us 180 days' prior written notice of non-renewal of the management agreement. If we were to terminate the management agreement without cause, we must pay a termination fee on the last day of the applicable term, equal to three times the average annual management fee earned by our Manager during the prior 24-month period immediately preceding the most recently completed month prior to the effective date of termination. We may only terminate the management agreement with or without cause with the consent of a majority of our independent directors. Our Manager is responsible for, among other things, performing all of our day-to-day functions, determining investment criteria in conjunction with our Board of Directors, sourcing, analyzing and executing investments, asset sales and financings and performing asset management duties.
We pay our Manager a base management fee payable monthly in arrears in an amount equal to 1/12 of 1.50% of our month-end stockholders' equity, adjusted to exclude the effect of any unrealized gains or losses included in retained earnings, each as computed in accordance with GAAP. There is no incentive compensation payable to our Manager pursuant to the management agreement. We reimburse our Manager for expenses directly related to our operations incurred by our Manager, excluding employment-related expenses.
Exemption from Regulation Under the Investment Company Act
We conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act (the “Act”), in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Act. So long as we qualify for this exemption, we will not be subject to leverage and other restrictions imposed on regulated investment companies, which would significantly reduce our ability to use leverage. Section 3(c)(5)(C), as interpreted by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), requires us to invest at least 55% of our assets in “mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate” or “qualifying real estate interests” and at least 80% of our assets in qualifying real estate interests and “real estate-related assets.” In satisfying this 55% requirement, based on pronouncements of the SEC staff and in certain instances our own judgment, we treat agency RMBS issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgage loans in which we hold all of the certificates issued by the pool (“whole pool” securities) as qualifying real estate interests. We typically treat “partial pool” and other mortgage securities where we hold less than all of the certificates issued by the pool as real estate-related assets.
Real Estate Investment Trust Requirements
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. So long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. Federal or state corporate income tax on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our taxable income to stockholders within the time limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends on our ability to continually meet requirements imposed upon REITs by the Internal Revenue Code, including satisfying certain organizational requirements, an annual distribution requirement and quarterly asset and annual income tests. The REIT asset and income tests are of significance to our operations as they restrict the extent to which we can invest in certain types of securities and conduct certain hedging activities within the REIT. Consequently, we may be required to limit these activities or conduct them through a TRS. We believe that we have been organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT.
Income Tests
To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income requirements on an annual basis. 

1. | At least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year generally must be derived from investments in real property or mortgages on real property.

 7


2. | At least 95% of our gross income in each taxable year generally must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the 75% gross income test described above, as well as other dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, which need not have any relation to real property.

Interest income from obligations secured by mortgages on real property (such as agency and non-agency securities) generally constitutes qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test described above to the extent that the obligation upon which such interest is paid is secured by a mortgage on real property. We expect that substantially all of our income from our agency and non-agency MBS will continue to be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Income from CRT securities is treated as non-qualifying income for the 75% gross income test, which potentially limits our ability to invest in CRT securities.
There is no direct authority with respect to the qualification of income or gains from TBAs for the 75% gross income test; however, we treat these as qualifying income for this purpose based on an opinion of legal counsel.
Income and gains from instruments that we use to hedge the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings, or to be incurred, to acquire real estate assets will generally be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator for the 75% and 95% gross income tests, provided that specified requirements are met.
Asset Tests
At the close of each calendar quarter, we must satisfy the following tests relating to the nature of our assets. 

1. | At least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by some combination of “real estate assets,” cash, cash items, U.S. Government securities, and, under some circumstances, stock or debt instruments purchased with new capital. For this purpose, mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans are generally treated as “real estate assets.” Assets that do not qualify for purposes of the 75% asset test are subject to the additional asset tests described below. 


2. | The value of any one issuer's securities that we own may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets.


3. | We may not own more than 10% of any one issuer's outstanding securities, as measured by either voting power or value. The 5% and 10% asset tests do not apply to securities of a TRS or a Qualified REIT Subsidiary (“QRS”) and the 10% asset test does not apply to “straight debt” having specified characteristics and to certain other securities described below. 


4. | The aggregate value of all securities of all TRSs that we hold may not exceed 20% of the value of total assets.


5. | No more than 25% of the total value of our assets may be represented by certain non-mortgage debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs (even though such debt instruments qualify under the 75% asset test).

If we should fail to satisfy the income or asset tests, such a failure would not cause us to lose our REIT qualification if we were able to eliminate the discrepancy within a 30 day cure period, in the case of the asset test, or satisfy certain relief provisions and pay any applicable penalty taxes and other fines. Please also refer to the “Risks Related to Our Taxation as a REIT” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for further discussion of REIT qualification requirements and related items.

Corporate Information
Our executive offices are located at Two Bethesda Metro Center, 12th Floor, Bethesda, MD 20814 and our telephone number is (301) 968-9220.
We make available all of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to such reports as well as our Code of Ethics and Conduct free of charge on our internet website at www.MTGE.com as soon as reasonably practical after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. These reports are also available on the SEC internet website at www.sec.gov.
Competition
Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. In acquiring our investments, we compete with other REITs, mortgage finance and specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, other lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. These entities and others that may be organized in the future may have similar asset acquisition objectives and increase competition for the available supply of mortgage assets suitable for purchase. 
 8

Additionally, our investment strategy is dependent on the amount of financing available to us in the repurchase agreement market, which may also be impacted by the overall supply of repurchase agreement funding and competing borrowers. Our investment strategy will be adversely impacted if we are not able to secure financing on favorable terms, if at all.
Employees
We are managed pursuant to the management agreement with our Manager. Other than employees of RCS, we do not have any employees. As of December 31, 2017, RCS had 7 employees.

MTGE INVESTMENT CORP.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1. Organization
We were incorporated in Maryland and commenced operations in 2011 following the completion of our initial public offering (“IPO”). We are externally managed by MTGE Management, LLC (our “Manager”), an affiliate of AGNC Investment Corp. (“AGNC”). Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “MTGE.”
We invest in, finance and manage a leveraged portfolio of real estate-related investments, which include agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“agency RMBS”), non-agency securities, other mortgage-related investments and other real estate investments. Agency RMBS include residential mortgage pass-through certificates and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) structured from residential mortgage pass-through certificates for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a government-sponsored enterprise (“GSE”), such as Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), or by a U.S. Government agency, such as Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”). Non-agency securities include securities backed by residential mortgages that are not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency and credit risk transfer securities (“CRT”). Other mortgage-related investments may include mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”), commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”), prime and non-prime residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans and mortgage-related derivatives. Other real estate investments include equity investments in healthcare and senior living facilities that are leased to or operated by third parties who conduct all business operations of the facilities.
Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders through a combination of dividends and net asset value appreciation. In pursuing this objective, we rely on our Manager’s expertise to construct and manage a diversified investment portfolio by selecting assets that, when properly financed and hedged, are expected to produce attractive risk-adjusted returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles.
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). As such, we are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. Federal or state corporate taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we distribute all of our annual taxable income to our stockholders. It is our intention to distribute 100% of our taxable income, after application of available tax attributes, within the time limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may extend into the subsequent taxable year.
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS assumes the conversion, exercise or issuance of all potential common stock equivalents unless the effect is to reduce a loss or increase the income per share. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of unrestricted demand deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.
 91

Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents
Restricted cash includes cash pledged as collateral for clearing and executing trades, derivatives and repurchase agreements and cash reserves for capital improvements on our healthcare real estate investments. Restricted cash is carried at cost, which approximates fair value.
Fair Value of Financial Assets
We have elected the option to account for all of our financial assets, including all mortgage-related investments, at estimated fair value, with changes in fair value reflected in income during the period in which they occur. In management's view, this election more appropriately reflects the results of our operations for a particular reporting period, as financial asset fair value changes are presented in a manner consistent with the presentation and timing of the fair value changes of hedging instruments. See Note 9 - Fair Value Measurements.
Interest Income
Interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount of the securities and their contractual terms. Premiums or discounts associated with the purchase of agency RMBS and non-agency securities of high credit quality are amortized or accreted into interest income, respectively, over the projected lives of the securities, including contractual payments and estimated prepayments, using the effective interest method. 
We estimate long-term prepayment speeds using a third-party service and market data. Actual and anticipated prepayment experience is reviewed at least quarterly and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between the previously estimated future prepayments and the amounts received plus currently anticipated future prepayments. If the actual and anticipated future prepayment experience differs from our prior estimate of prepayments, we are required to record an adjustment in the current period to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts for the cumulative difference in the effective yield through the reporting date.
At the time we purchase non-agency securities that are not of high credit quality, we determine an effective yield based on our estimate of the timing and amount of future cash flows and our cost basis. Our initial cash flow estimates for these investments are based on our observations of current information and events and include assumptions related to interest rates, prepayment rates and the impact of default and severity rates on the timing and amount of credit losses. On at least a quarterly basis, we review the estimated cash flows and make appropriate adjustments, based on inputs and analysis received from external sources, internal models, and our judgment about interest rates, prepayment rates, the timing and amount of credit losses, and other factors. Any resulting changes in effective yield are recognized prospectively based on the current amortized cost of the investment as adjusted for credit impairment, if any.
Real Property Owned
Tangible assets primarily consist of land, buildings and furniture, fixtures and equipment. Depreciable tangible assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which can range from 3 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment to 40 years for buildings.
On January 1, 2017 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business (“ASU 2017-01”) which provides a framework to determine whether a transaction involves an asset, or a group of assets, or a business. ASU 2017-01 states that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, the transaction should not be considered a business combination. The ASU also clarifies the requirements for a set of activities to be considered a business and narrows the definition of outputs that would lead to business combination accounting treatment. As a result of these changes, the Company expects that a majority of its future real estate acquisitions and dispositions will be deemed asset transactions rather than business combinations. For asset acquisitions subsequent to January 1, 2017, the Company records identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any associated noncontrolling interests at cost on a relative fair value basis, with no goodwill recognized and third-party transaction costs capitalized. 

The net book value of long-lived assets is reviewed quarterly on a property by property basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or that depreciable lives may need to be changed. We consider external factors relating to each asset and the existence of a master lease that may link the cash flows of an individual asset to a larger 
 92

portfolio of assets leased to the same tenant. If these factors and the projected undiscounted cash flows of the asset over the remaining depreciation period indicate that the asset will not be recoverable, the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair market value. In addition, we are exposed to the risks inherent in investments in real estate and, in particular, the senior housing and healthcare industries. A downturn in these industries or in the real estate markets in which our properties are located could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or terms acceptable to us.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets can include goodwill and identifiable intangible assets such as above or below market component of in-place leases and the value associated with the presence of in-place tenants or residents. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of net assets recognized and represents the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill and intangible assets are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. 
Healthcare Real Estate Income
Healthcare real estate income consists primarily of lease and rental income. For operating leases with minimum scheduled rent increases, the Company recognizes income on a straight line basis over the lease term when collectability is reasonably assured. Recognizing lease income on a straight line basis results in a difference in the timing of revenue amounts from what is contractually due. If the Company determines that collectability of straight line lease income is not reasonably assured, future revenue recognition is limited to amounts contractually owed and paid, and, when appropriate, an allowance for estimated losses is established.
Resident rental income is recorded when services are rendered and includes resident room and care charges, community fees and other resident charges. Residency agreements are generally for a term of 30 days to one year, with resident fees billed monthly. Revenue for certain care-related services is recognized as the services are provided.
Noncontrolling Interests

Arrangements with noncontrolling interest holders are reported as a component of equity separate from the Company’s stockholders' equity, recorded at the initial carrying amount, and increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interest’s share of net income or loss. Net income attributable to a noncontrolling interest is included in net income on the consolidated statements of operations.
Deferred Loan Expenses
We amortize deferred financing costs, which are reported within notes payable, net of deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheets, as a component of interest expense of the debt over the terms of the related borrowings using a method that approximates a level yield. 
Repurchase Agreements
We finance the acquisition of agency RMBS and non-agency securities through repurchase transactions under master repurchase agreements. We account for repurchase transactions as collateralized financing transactions which are carried at their contractual amounts, including accrued interest, as specified in the respective transaction agreements. The contractual amounts approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities or floating rate coupons.
Reverse Repurchase Agreements and Obligation to Return Securities Borrowed under Reverse Repurchase Agreements
We borrow securities to cover short sales of U.S. Treasury securities through reverse repurchase transactions under our master repurchase agreements (see Derivatives below). We account for these as securities borrowing transactions and recognize an obligation to return the borrowed securities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets based on the value of the underlying borrowed securities as of the reporting date. The fair value of our reverse repurchase agreements is assumed to equal cost as they generally mature daily or have interest rates that are reset daily.
 93

Manager Compensation
The management agreement provides for the payment to our Manager of a management fee and reimbursement of certain operating expenses, which are accrued and expensed during the period for which they are earned or incurred. Refer to Note 13 for disclosure on the terms of the management agreement.
Derivatives
We utilize a risk management strategy, under which we may use a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to market risks, including interest rate risk, prepayment risk, extension risk and credit risk. The objective of our risk management strategy is to reduce fluctuations in net asset value over a range of market conditions. The principal instruments that we currently use are interest rate swaps and options to enter into interest rate swaps (“interest rate swaptions”). We also utilize forward contracts for the purchase or sale of agency RMBS, or to-be-announced forward (“TBA”) contracts, and short sales of U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts. We may also purchase or sell options on TBA securities and utilize other types of derivative instruments.
We also enter into TBA contracts as a means of investing in and financing agency RMBS (thereby increasing our “at
risk” leverage) or as a means of disposing of or reducing our exposure to agency RMBS (thereby reducing our “at risk” leverage). Pursuant to TBA contracts, we agree to purchase or sell, for future delivery, agency RMBS with certain principal and interest terms and certain types of collateral, but the particular agency RMBS to be delivered are not identified until shortly before the TBA settlement date. We may also choose, prior to settlement, to move the settlement of these securities out to a later date by entering into an offsetting short or long position (referred to as a “pair off”), net settling the paired off positions for cash, and simultaneously purchasing or selling a similar TBA contract for a later settlement date. This transaction is commonly referred to as a “dollar roll.” The agency RMBS purchased or sold for a forward settlement date are typically priced at a discount to agency RMBS for settlement in the current month. This difference (or discount) is referred to as the “price drop.” The price drop is the economic equivalent of net interest carry income on the underlying agency RMBS over the roll period (interest income less implied financing cost) and is commonly referred to as “dollar roll income (loss).” Consequently, forward purchases of agency RMBS and dollar roll transactions represent a form of off-balance sheet financing. 
We present all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and report all changes in fair value in earnings in our consolidated statements of operations in unrealized gain (loss) on other derivatives and securities, net during the period in which they occur. Derivatives in a gain position are reported as derivative assets at fair value and derivatives in a loss position are reported as derivative liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Cash receipts and payments related to derivative instruments are classified in our consolidated statements of cash flows according to the underlying nature or purpose of the derivative transaction, generally in the investing section.
Our derivative agreements generally contain provisions that allow for netting or setting off derivative assets and liabilities with each counterparty; however, we report related assets and liabilities on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets.
The use of derivative instruments creates exposure to credit risk relating to potential losses that could be recognized in the event counterparties to these instruments fail to perform their obligations under the contracts. Our derivative agreements require that we post or receive collateral based on daily market value changes. We also attempt to minimize our risk of loss by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings, monitoring positions with individual counterparties and adjusting posted collateral as required.
Interest rate swap agreements
We use interest rate swaps to hedge the variable cash flows associated with short-term borrowings made under our repurchase agreement and other financing facilities. Under our interest rate swap agreements, we typically pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate based on one, three or six-month LIBOR (“payer swaps”) with terms up to 15 years. The floating rate we receive under our swap agreements has the effect of offsetting the repricing characteristics of our repurchase agreements and cash flows on such liabilities. Our swap agreements are privately negotiated in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) market. Swap agreements entered into subsequent to May 2013 are centrally cleared through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”), a registered commodities exchange.

We estimate the fair value of our centrally cleared interest rate swaps using the daily settlement price determined by the respective exchange. Centrally cleared swaps are valued by the exchange using a pricing model that references observable market inputs, including LIBOR, swap rates and the forward yield curve, to produce the daily settlement price. 
 94

Our centrally cleared swaps require that we post an “initial margin” to our counterparties for an amount determined by the CME, which is generally intended to be set at a level sufficient to protect the CME from the maximum estimated single-day price movement in that market participant’s contracts. We also exchange cash “variation margin” with our counterparties on our centrally cleared swaps based upon daily changes in the fair value as measured by the CME. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, as a result of a CME amendment to its rule book governing central clearing activities, the daily exchange of variation margin associated with a CME centrally cleared derivative instrument is legally characterized as the daily settlement of the derivative instrument itself, as opposed to a pledge of collateral. Accordingly, beginning in 2017, we account for the daily receipt or payment of variation margin associated with our centrally cleared interest rate swaps as a direct reduction to the carrying value of the interest rate swap derivative asset or liability, respectively. Beginning in 2017, the carrying amount of centrally cleared interest rate swaps reflected in our consolidated balance sheets is equal to the unsettled fair value of such instruments.
We estimate the fair value of our “non-centrally cleared” interest rate swaps based on valuations obtained from third-party pricing services and the swap counterparty (collectively, “third-party valuations”). The third-party valuations are model-driven using observable inputs, including LIBOR, swap rates and the forward yield curve. We also consider the creditworthiness of both us and our counterparties and the impact of netting and credit enhancement provisions contained in each derivative agreement, such as collateral postings. All of our “non-centrally cleared” interest rate swaps are subject to bilateral collateral arrangements. Consequently, no credit valuation adjustment was made in determining the fair value of such instruments. 
The payment of periodic settlements of net interest on interest rate swaps is reported in realized loss on periodic settlements of interest rate swaps, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Cash payments received or paid for the early termination of an interest rate swap agreement are recorded as realized loss on other derivatives and securities, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Changes in fair value of our interest rate swap agreements are reported in unrealized gain (loss) on other derivatives and securities, net in our consolidated statements of operations.
Interest rate swaptions
We purchase interest rate swaptions to help mitigate the potential impact of larger, more rapid changes in interest rates
on the performance of our investment portfolio. The interest rate swaptions provide us the option to enter into an interest rate swap agreement for a predetermined notional amount, stated term and pay or receive interest rates in the future. The premium paid for interest rate swaptions is reported as a derivative asset in our consolidated balance sheets. We estimate the fair value of interest rate swaptions based on the fair value of the future interest rate swap that we have the option to enter into as well as the remaining length of time that we have to exercise the option. The difference between the premium and the fair value of the swaption is reported in unrealized gain (loss) on other derivatives and securities, net in our consolidated statements of operations. If a swaption expires unexercised, the realized loss on the swaption would be equal to the premium paid and reported in realized loss on other derivatives and securities, net in our consolidated statements of operations. If we exercise a swaption, the realized gain or loss on the swaption would be equal to the difference between the fair value of the underlying interest rate swap and the premium paid and reported in realized gain (loss) on other derivatives and securities, net in our consolidated statements of operations. 
Interest rate swaption agreements are privately negotiated in the OTC market and are not subject to central clearing. We estimate the fair value of our interest rate swaption agreements based on model-driven valuations obtained from third-party
pricing services and the swaption counterparty. These estimates incorporate observable inputs and include the fair value of the future interest rate swaps that we have the option to enter into, as well as the remaining length of time that we have to exercise the options, adjusted for non-performance risk, if any.
TBA securities
TBA securities are forward contracts for the purchase (“long position”) or sale (“short position”) of agency RMBS at a predetermined price, face amount, issuer, coupon and stated maturity on an agreed-upon future date. The specific agency RMBS delivered into the contract upon the settlement date, published each month by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, are not known at the time of the transaction. We may enter into TBA contracts as a means of hedging against short-term changes in interest rates. We may also enter into TBA dollar roll transactions to finance agency RMBS purchases. 
We account for all TBA contracts as derivatives since we cannot assert that it is probable at the inception and throughout the term of the contract that it will not settle net and will result in physical delivery of an agency security when it is issued. A 
 95

TBA dollar roll transaction is a series of derivative transactions. The net settlement of a TBA contract is reported as realized gain (loss) on other derivatives and securities, net and changes in the fair value of our TBA contracts are reported as unrealized gain (loss) on other derivatives and securities, net in our consolidated statements of operations.
We estimate the fair value of TBA securities based on similar methods used to value our agency RMBS.
U.S. Treasury securities
We purchase or sell short U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts to help mitigate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on the performance of our portfolio. Realized gains and losses associated with purchases and short sales of U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts are recognized in realized gain (loss) on other derivatives and securities, net, and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in unrealized gain (loss) on other derivatives and securities, net on our consolidated statements of operations.
Income Taxes
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the corresponding provisions of state law. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must annually distribute, in a timely manner to our stockholders, at least 90% of our taxable ordinary income. A REIT is generally not subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income tax on its earnings to the extent that it distributes its annual taxable income to its stockholders and as long as certain asset, income and stock ownership tests are met. We operate in a manner that will allow us to be taxed as a REIT. As permitted by the Internal Revenue Code, a REIT can designate dividends paid in the subsequent year as dividends of the current year if those dividends are both declared by the extended due date of the REIT's Federal income tax return and paid to stockholders by the last day of the subsequent year, however, we may still be subject to a non-deductible 4% excise tax if the actual amount distributed to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under federal tax laws.
We and certain of our domestic subsidiaries have made joint elections to treat the subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”). As such, these subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income tax.
During December of 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was signed into law. The TCJA includes sweeping changes to the U.S. tax system starting in fiscal year 2018, including a reduction of the maximum Federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and a lower effective pass-through business income tax rate through the creation of a new deduction for individuals, estates, and trusts of 20 percent of their combined qualified business income amount and REIT ordinary dividend distributions received. Since we typically distribute all our annual taxable income and, as such, do not pay corporate income taxes, we do not expect the TCJA to have a significant impact now or in the future on our consolidated financial statements.
We evaluate uncertain income tax positions, if any, in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. To the extent we incur interest and/or penalties in connection with our tax obligations, such amounts shall be classified as income tax expense on our consolidated statements of operations.
New Accounting Pronouncements
We consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates ("ASUs") issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. ASUs not listed below were determined to be either not applicable, are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements when adopted, or did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, which is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that supersedes virtually all existing revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue recognition with respect to financial instruments and leases is not within the scope of ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and our review of each of our revenue streams indicates that it will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 which requires the lease rights and obligations arising from lease contracts, including existing and new arrangements, to be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.  ASU 
 96

2016-02 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 which addresses several classification issues related to the statement of cash flow, including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, and contingent consideration payments made after a business combination. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18 which requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Our Prime non-agency securities include investments in securitization trusts collateralized by prime mortgage loans, which were originated between 2002 and 2006, a period of generally weaker underwriting standards and elevated housing prices. As a result, there is still material credit risk embedded in these loan origination vintages. As of December 31, 2017, Prime non-agency securities also include $17.9 million in fair value of securities with underlying mortgage loans that were originated with more stringent underwriting standards beginning in 2010. As of December 31, 2017, our Prime securities have both fixed and floating rate coupons ranging from 2.2% to 6.5%, with weighted average coupons of underlying collateral ranging from 3.5% to 5.1%.
Our CRT reference the performance of loans underlying agency RMBS issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, which were subject to their underwriting standards. As of December 31, 2017, our CRT securities had fixed and floating rate coupons ranging from 1.3% to 8.5%, with weighted average coupons of underlying collateral ranging from 3.6% to 4.3%. The loans underlying our CRT securities were originated between 2012 and 2017.
Our Alt-A non-agency RMBS are collateralized by Alt-A mortgage loans that were originated from 2002 to 2007. Alt-A, or alternative A-paper, mortgage loans are considered to have more credit risk than prime mortgage loans and less credit risk than sub-prime mortgage loans. Alt-A loans are typically characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores, higher loan-to-value ratios and a higher percentage of investment properties. As of December 31, 2017, our Alt-A securities had both fixed and floating rate coupons ranging from 1.6% to 6.5% with weighted average coupons of underlying collateral ranging from 3.6% to 5.8%. 
Our Option-ARM non-agency RMBS include senior tranches in securitization trusts that are collateralized by residential mortgages that have origination and underwriting characteristics similar to Alt-A mortgage loans, with the added feature of providing underlying mortgage borrowers the option, within certain constraints, to make lower payments than otherwise required by the stated interest rate for a number of years, leading to negative amortization and increased loan balances. This additional feature can increase the credit risk of these securities. As of December 31, 2017, our Option-ARM securities had coupons ranging from 1.7% to 2.3% and have underlying collateral with weighted average coupons between 3.5% and 4.4%. The loans underlying our Option-ARM securities were originated between 2004 and 2007.
Our Subprime non-agency RMBS include investments in securitization trusts collateralized by residential mortgages originated during or before 2005 that were originally considered to be of lower credit quality. As of December 31, 2017, our Subprime securities had a fair value of $13.4 million with fixed and floating rate coupons ranging from 5.0% to 5.5% and have underlying collateral with weighted-average coupons ranging from 5.6% to 5.7%. 
Our CMBS are collateralized by a commercial mortgage loan originated in 2016 that is secured by first priority liens on 64 skilled nursing facilities. As of December 31, 2017, our CMBS securities had a fair market value of $18.7 million with fixed rate coupons ranging from 5.2% to 6.6% and underlying collateral with a weighted average coupon of 4.5%. 
More than 90% of our non-agency RMBS are rated below investment grade or have not been rated by credit agencies as of December 31, 2017.

Income from Healthcare Real Estate Investments
The following table presents the components of net income from our real property investments for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):

 | For the Years Ended December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016
Lease income | $ | 18,283 | | | $ | 3,626
Rental income | 6,148 | | | 2,433 |

Net healthcare investment income | $ | 5,862 | | | $ | 659 

Healthcare lease income is derived from our real property investments subject to triple net lease arrangements, and rental income relates to investments made through RIDEA joint ventures. Under RIDEA, a REIT may lease “qualified healthcare properties” on an arm’s-length basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor.” Generally, the rent received from the TRS will meet the related party rent exception and will be treated as “rents from real property.” Resident level rents and related operating expenses are subject to federal and state income taxes as the operations of such facilities are included in a TRS.
At December 31, 2017, future minimum lease payments receivable related to our healthcare and senior living facilities are as follows (dollars in thousands):

 | December 31, 2017
2018 | $ | 20,345

Note 6. Repurchase Agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank Advances
We pledge certain of our securities as collateral under repurchase and other financing arrangements with financial institutions and the terms and conditions are negotiated on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Interest rates on these borrowings are generally based on LIBOR plus or minus a margin and amounts available to be borrowed are dependent upon the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral, which fluctuates with changes in interest rates, type of security and liquidity conditions within the banking, mortgage finance and real estate industries. In response to declines in fair value of pledged securities, lenders may require us to post additional collateral or pay down borrowings to re-establish agreed upon collateral requirements, referred to as margin calls. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we have met all margin call requirements and had no agency or non-agency repurchase agreements with original overnight maturities. Repurchase agreements are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities or floating rate coupons.

Note 7. Derivatives and Other Securities
In connection with our risk management strategy, we mitigate our exposure to market risks, including interest rate risk, prepayment risk and credit risk, by entering into derivative and other hedging instrument contracts. We may enter into agreements for interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate cap or floor contracts and futures or forward contracts. We may also purchase or short TBA and U.S. Treasury securities, purchase or sell options on TBA securities or we may invest in other types of derivative securities, including synthetic total return swaps and credit default swaps. Our risk management strategy attempts to manage the overall risk of the portfolio and reduce fluctuations in net asset value. Derivatives have not been designated as hedging instruments. For additional information regarding our derivative instruments and our overall risk management strategy, please refer to the discussion of derivatives in Note 2.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements
Our derivative portfolio includes interest rate swaps, which are used to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. Under our interest rate swaps, we typically pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate based on LIBOR with terms usually ranging up to 15 years. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had interest rate swap agreements summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands).

U.S. Treasury Securities and Futures
We purchase or sell short U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates.
We had obligations to return U.S. Treasury securities borrowed under reverse repurchase agreements accounted for as securities borrowing transactions with a fair value of $0.8 billion and $0.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The borrowed securities were collateralized by cash payments of $0.8 billion and $0.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are presented as receivable under reverse repurchase agreements on the consolidated balance sheets. All changes in fair value of long and short U.S. Treasury securities and futures are recorded in realized and unrealized gain (loss) on other derivatives and securities, net in our consolidated statements of operations.
Credit Default Swaps
We may invest in credit default swaps to mitigate a portion of the potential impact of credit risk on the fair values of our CRT non-agency securities. As of December 31, 2017, we had credit default swaps with a notional amount of $48.0 million and a liability fair value of $3.1 million. Credit default swaps are presented in derivative liabilities, at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets.
Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features
The use of derivatives creates exposure to credit risk relating to potential losses that could be recognized in the event that the counterparties to these instruments fail to perform their obligations under the contracts. We minimize this risk by limiting our counterparties for instruments which are not centrally cleared on a registered exchange to major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings and monitoring positions with individual counterparties. In addition, both we and our counterparties may be required to pledge collateral for our derivatives, based on the market value, notional amount and remaining term of the derivative contract. In the event of a default by a counterparty, we may not receive payments provided for under the terms of our derivative agreements, and may have difficulty obtaining our assets pledged as collateral for our derivatives. The cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral for our derivative instruments is included in restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets.
Each of our ISDA Master Agreements contains provisions pursuant to which we are required to fully collateralize our obligations under our interest rate swap agreements if at any point the fair value of the swap represents a liability greater than the minimum transfer amount contained within our ISDA Master Agreements. We are also required to post initial collateral upon execution of certain of our swap transactions. If we breach any of these provisions, we will be required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination values, which approximates fair value.
Further, each of our ISDA Master Agreements contain cross default provisions under which a default under certain of our other indebtedness in excess of a certain threshold causes an event of default under the agreement. Threshold amounts vary by lender. Following an event of default, we could be required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination values. Additionally, under certain of our ISDA Master Agreements, we could be required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination values if we fail to maintain either our REIT status or certain minimum equity thresholds, or comply with limits on our leverage above certain specified levels. As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of the additional collateral that could be required to be posted as a result of the credit-risk related contingent features being triggered was not material to our consolidated financial statements.
Concerning our non-centrally cleared interest rate swap and swaption agreements, we did not have counterparty credit risk with any single counterparty in excess of 1% of our equity, as of December 31, 2017. 
In the case of centrally cleared interest rate swap contracts, we could be exposed to credit risk if the central clearing agency or a clearing member defaults on its respective obligation to perform under the contract; however, the risk is considered minimal due to initial and daily exchange of mark to market margin requirements and the clearinghouse guarantee fund and other resources that are available in the event of a clearing member default.

Note 8. Offsetting Assets and Liabilities 
Certain of our repurchase agreements and derivative transactions are governed by underlying agreements that generally provide for a right of offset under master netting arrangements (or similar agreements), including in the event of default or in the event of bankruptcy of either party to the transactions.  We present our assets and liabilities subject to such arrangements on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets.  The following tables present information about our assets and liabilities that are subject to such agreements and can potentially be offset on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):

Note 9. Fair Value Measurements
We have elected the option to account for all of our financial assets at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected in income during the period in which they occur. We have determined that this presentation most appropriately represents our financial results and position. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability.
We determine the fair value of our agency and non-agency securities, including securities held as collateral, based upon fair value estimates obtained from multiple third-party pricing services and dealers. In determining fair value, third-party pricing sources use various valuation approaches, including market and income approaches. Factors used by third-party sources in estimating the fair value of an instrument may include observable inputs such as recent trading activity, credit data, volatility statistics, and other market data that are current as of the measurement date. The availability of observable inputs can vary by instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of instrument, whether the instrument is new and not yet established in the marketplace and other characteristics particular to the instrument. Third-party pricing sources may also use certain unobservable inputs, such as assumptions of future levels of prepayment, default and loss severity, especially when estimating fair values for securities with lower levels of recent trading activity. When possible, we make inquiries of third-party pricing sources to understand their use of significant inputs and assumptions. 
We review the various third-party fair value estimates and perform procedures to validate their reasonableness, including an analysis of the range of third-party estimates for each position, comparison to recent trade activity for similar securities, and our Manager's review for consistency with market conditions observed as of the measurement date. While we do not adjust prices we obtain from third-party pricing sources, we will exclude third-party prices for securities from our determination of fair value if we determine (based on our validation procedures and our Manager's market knowledge and expertise) that the price is significantly different than observable market data would indicate and we cannot obtain a satisfactory understanding from the third party source as to the significant inputs used to determine the price.
We determine the fair value of MSR based upon third party estimates, corroborated by other market inputs and internally developed discounted cash flow models that utilize observable market-based inputs and include substantial unobservable market data inputs (including prepayment speeds, delinquency levels and discount rates).
We utilize a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instrument’s categorization within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. We use the results of the validation procedures described above as part of our determination of the appropriate fair value measurement hierarchy classification. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:

• | Level 1 Inputs - Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical unrestricted assets and liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date. 


• | Level 2 Inputs - Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 


• | Level 3 Inputs - Significant unobservable market inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. The unobservable inputs represent the assumptions that market participants would use to price the assets and liabilities. 

 111

The following tables present our financial instruments carried at fair value as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, on the consolidated balance sheets by the valuation hierarchy, as described above (in thousands):

Total | $ | 474,935 | | | $ | 27,820 | | $ | — | $ | 502,755 

Our agency and non-agency securities are valued using the various market data described above, which include inputs determined to be observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. Accordingly, our agency and non-agency securities are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2017. 
For information regarding valuation of our derivative instruments, please refer to the discussion of derivative and other hedging instruments in Note 2. Our interest rate swaps and other derivatives are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of our obligation to return securities borrowed under reverse repurchase agreements is based upon the value of the underlying borrowed U.S. Treasury securities as of the reporting date. Both U.S. Treasury securities and our
obligation to return borrowed U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
Excluded from the table above are financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables, borrowings under repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and debt secured by healthcare real estate investments, which are presented in our consolidated financial statements at cost. The cost basis of financial instruments with initial terms of less than one year are determined to approximate fair value, primarily due to the short duration of these instruments.  The cost basis of floating rate borrowings with initial terms of greater than one year is determined to approximate fair value, primarily as such agreements have floating interest rates based on an index plus or minus a fixed spread and the fixed spread is generally consistent with those demanded in the market. The fair value of fixed rate secured debt is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made with 
 112

similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. We estimate the fair value of these instruments using Level 2 inputs.
In addition to items that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, we also have assets and liabilities in our balance sheet that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including those acquired in business combinations. We have determined that the fair value measurements included in each of these assets and liabilities rely primarily on company-specific inputs and our assumptions about the use of the assets and settlement of liabilities, and that each of these fair value measurements generally incorporate Level 3 inputs. We estimate the fair value of real estate and related intangibles using the income approach and unobservable data such as net operating income and estimated capitalization and discount rates. We also consider local and national industry market data including comparable sales, and commonly engage an external real estate appraiser to assist us in our estimation of fair value. We estimate the fair value of secured debt assumed in business combinations using current interest rates at which similar borrowings could be obtained on the transaction date.

Risk Mitigation Activities
The Company’s previous investment in MSR exposes us to certain risks, including representation and warranty risk. Representation and warranty risk refers to the representations and warranties we made (or are deemed to have made) to the applicable investor (including, without limitation, the GSEs) regarding, among other things, the origination and servicing of mortgage loans with respect to which we had acquired MSR. We mitigated representation and warranty risk through our due diligence in connection with MSR acquisitions, including counterparty reviews and loan file reviews, as well as negotiated contractual protections from our MSR transaction counterparties with respect to prior origination and servicing. In connection with the sale of its servicing assets and remaining MSR in 2016 and 2017, RCS retained certain risk exposure existing prior to the time of such sales, including representation and warranty risk.

Note 13. Management Agreement and Related Parties
We have entered into a management agreement with our Manager with a current renewal term through August 9, 2018 and automatic one-year extension options thereafter. The management agreement may be terminated by us without cause, as defined in the management agreement, upon 90 days’ prior written notice. The management agreement may be terminated by our Manager without cause, as defined in the management agreement, after the completion of the current renewal term, or the expiration of any automatic subsequent renewal term, provided that our Manager provides 180-days prior written notice of non-renewal of the management agreement. If we were to terminate the management agreement without cause, we must pay a termination fee on the last day of the applicable term, equal to three times the average annual management fee earned by our Manager during the prior 24-month period immediately preceding the most recently completed month prior to the effective date of termination. We may only terminate the management agreement with or without cause with the consent of a majority of our independent directors. Our Manager is responsible for, among other things, performing all of our day-to-day functions, determining investment criteria in conjunction with our Board of Directors, sourcing, analyzing and executing investments, asset sales and financings and performing asset management duties.
All of our officers, other members of our investment team and other support personnel are employees of the parent company of our Manager. Our Manager provides the infrastructure, business relationships, management expertise, information technologies, capital raising capabilities, legal and compliance functions, and accounting, treasury and investor relations capabilities required to enable our Manager to fulfill all of its responsibilities under the management agreement.
We pay our Manager a base management fee payable monthly in arrears in an amount equal to one twelfth of 1.50% of our month-end stockholders' equity, adjusted to exclude the effect of any unrealized gains or losses included in retained earnings, each as computed in accordance with GAAP. There is no incentive compensation payable to our Manager pursuant to the management agreement. We recorded an expense for management fees of $13.7 million, $14.5 million and $17.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which $1.0 million and $1.1 million are included in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
In addition, we reimburse our Manager for expenses directly related to our operations, excluding employment-related expenses of our Manager. We recorded expense reimbursements to our Manager of $2.0 million, $2.4 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which $0.1 million and $0.6 million is included in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, consisting mostly of information technology system expenses. 
As of December 31, 2017, the parent company of our Manager, held 1.6 million shares of our common stock.

We have distributed all of our 2017 taxable income within the allowable time frame, including the available spill-back provision, so that we will not be subject to Federal or state corporate income tax. We do not currently expect to incur any excise tax liability for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
Based on our analysis of any potential uncertain income tax positions, we concluded that we do not have any uncertain tax positions that meet the recognition or measurement criteria as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Our tax returns for tax years since 2014 are open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). 
RCS is taxable as a corporation under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code, with which we filed a joint TRS election. As of December 31, 2017, RCS had Federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately $118 million, which can be carried forward for up to twenty years. The utilization of approximately $50 million of the NOL is subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. RCS sold its MSR holdings during the first quarter of 2017 and incurred approximately $14 million of capital loss, which can be carried forward for up to five years. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) signed into law during the fourth quarter of 2017 reduces the Corporate tax rate to
21% for tax years starting after December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, RCS’s gross deferred tax assets associated with
the NOL and temporary differences other than the AMT credit carryforward, as reevaluated based on the new corporate tax rate
and estimated state effective rate, were approximately $31 million, with respect to which RCS has provided a full valuation allowance. 
The valuation allowance previously provided on the AMT credit carryforward has been released due to the repeal of corporate AMT tax and the credit refund mechanism provided by TCJA. As a result, a deferred tax benefit of $0.6 million has been recorded in the consolidated statements of operations, and a corresponding income tax receivable is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017. 
Note 15. Stockholders’ Equity
Redeemable Preferred Stock
Pursuant to our charter, we are authorized to designate and issue up to 50.0 million shares of preferred stock in one or more classes or series. Our Board of Directors has designated 2.3 million shares as 8.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”). As of December 31, 2017, we had 47.8 million of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. Shares of our Series A Preferred Stock are redeemable at $25.00 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) exclusively at our option commencing on May 22, 2019, or earlier under certain circumstances intended to preserve our qualification as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of each January, April, July and October. As of December 31, 2017, we had declared all required quarterly dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock.
Our Board of Directors may designate additional series of authorized preferred stock ranking junior to or in parity with the Series A Preferred Stock or designate additional shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and authorize the issuance of such shares. Our Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption.
Common Stock Repurchase Program
Our Board of Directors adopted a stock repurchase plan pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares of common stock through December 31, 2018. The Company may repurchase shares in the open market or privately negotiated transactions or pursuant to a trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company intends to repurchase shares under the stock repurchase plan only when the repurchase price is less than its estimate of its then current net asset value per common share. The total amount of $100 million remains authorized and available for common stock repurchases as of December 31, 2017.
Shares of our common stock may be purchased in the open market, including through block purchases, or through privately negotiated transactions, or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined at our discretion and the program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason.

Long-Term Incentive Plan
The Company sponsors the American Capital Mortgage Investment Corp. Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan (“Incentive Plan” or “plan”), as amended March 4, 2016, to provide for the issuance of equity-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSU”) and unrestricted stock to our independent directors. During 2017,
2016 and 2015, we granted restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards under the plan to our independent directors totaling $0.3 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The awards represent the right to receive an equivalent number of shares of common stock as measured by the closing price of our common stock on the grant date, plus any equivalent shares for dividends declared on our common stock, and vest over a 13 month period, subject to the terms and conditions of the plan. We did not issue any shares of common stock related to the vesting of RSU awards during the year ended December 31, 2017, as any awards vested during the period were deferred to future periods. We issued 38,314 shares of common stock to our independent directors related to the vesting of RSU awards during the year ended December 31, 2016. We have made no awards under the plan to our officers or the officers or employees of our Manager, and we no longer intend to issue RSUs to RCS employees.
During 2014, we granted RSU awards under the plan to certain members of RCS management totaling $5.4 million in aggregate value. In connection with the sale of all of its subservicing assets in the first quarter of 2016, we issued 136,979 shares of common stock related to the vesting of RSU awards during the year ended December 31, 2016. All remaining unvested RSU common stock equivalents issued to RCS employees were forfeited in the first quarter of 2016.
The following table summarizes restricted stock and RSU transactions during the three years ended December 31, 2017:

During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $0.2 million, $2.1 million and $1.6 million of compensation expense under the plan, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had unrecognized compensation costs related to awards granted under the plan of approximately $0.1 million. As of December 31, 2017, we had 862,277 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our long-term incentive plan. 
Net Income per Common Share
Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share assumes the conversion, exercise or issuance of all potential common stock equivalents unless the effect is to reduce a loss or increase the income per share. Any shares subject to performance conditions that would not be issuable at period end, if that were the end of the contingency period, have been excluded from diluted net income per common share.
 117

Net income used in the numerator to calculate both basic and diluted EPS is the same.  The number of shares used in the denominator of the calculation for basic and diluted EPS is different by an amount equal to the dilutive effect of stock awards issued to employees and directors.
At-the-Market Offering Program
During August 2017, we entered into agreements with sales agents to publicly offer and sell shares of our common stock in privately negotiated and/or at-the-market transactions from time-to-time up to an aggregate amount of $125 million of shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we have not issued any shares under this program.
