 Generation 
 Generation, one of the largest competitive electric generation companies in the United States as measured by owned and contracted MW, physically delivers and markets power across multiple geographic regions through its customer-facing business, Constellation. Constellation sells electricity and natural gas, including renewable energy, in competitive energy markets to both wholesale and retail customers. The retail sales include commercial, industrial and residential customers. Generation leverages its energy generation portfolio to ensure delivery of energy to both wholesale and retail customers under long-term and short-term contracts, and in wholesale power markets. Generation operates in well-developed energy markets and employs an integrated hedging strategy to manage commodity price volatility. Generations fleet also provides geographic and supply source diversity. Generations customers include distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, financial institutions, and commercial, industrial, governmental, and residential customers in competitive markets. Generations customer facing activities foster development and delivery of other innovative energy-related products and services for its customers. 
 Generation is a public utility under the Federal Power Act and is subject to FERCs exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Under the Federal Power Act, FERC has the authority to grant or deny market-based rates for sales of energy, capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable. FERCs jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the market-based rates of utilities and set cost-based rates should FERC find that its previous grant of market-based rates authority is no longer just and reasonable. Other matters subject to FERC jurisdiction include, but are not limited to, third-party financings; review of mergers; dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility; affiliate transactions; intercompany financings and cash management arrangements; certain internal corporate reorganizations; and certain holding company acquisitions of public utility and holding company securities. Additionally, ERCOT is not subject to regulation by FERC but performs a similar function in Texas to that performed by RTOs in markets regulated by FERC. Specific operations of Generation are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal, state, regional and local agencies, including the NRC and Federal and state environmental protection agencies. Additionally, Generation is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC, with the approval of FERC. 
 RTOs and ISOs exist in a number of regions to provide transmission service across multiple transmission systems. PJM, MISO, ISO-NE and SPP, have been approved by FERC as RTOs, and CAISO and ISO-NY have been approved as ISOs. These entities are responsible for regional planning, managing transmission congestion, developing wholesale markets for energy and capacity, maintaining reliability, market monitoring, the scheduling of physical power sales brokered through ICE and NYMEX and the elimination or reduction of redundant transmission charges imposed by multiple transmission providers when wholesale customers take transmission service across several transmission systems.

Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, Inc. 
 Generation owns a 50.01% interest in CENG, a joint venture with EDF. CENG is governed by a board of ten directors, five of which are appointed by Generation and five by EDF. CENG owns a total of five nuclear generating facilities on three sites, Calvert Cliffs, R.E. Ginna and Nine Mile Point. CENGs ownership share in the total capacity of these units is 4,007 MW. See ITEM 2. PROPERTIES for additional information on these sites. 
 Generation and EDF also entered into a Put Option Agreement on April 1, 2014, pursuant to which EDF has the option, exercisable beginning on January 1, 2016 and thereafter until June 30, 2022, to sell its 49.99% interest in CENG to Generation for a fair market value price determined by agreement of the parties, or absent agreement, a third-party arbitration process. In addition, under limited circumstances, the period for exercise of the put option may be extended for 18 months. 
 Prior to April 1, 2014, Exelon and Generation accounted for their investment in CENG under the equity method of accounting. The transfer of the nuclear operating licenses and the execution of the NOSA on April 1, 2014, resulted in the derecognition of the equity method investment in CENG and the recording of all assets, liabilities and EDFs noncontrolling interests in CENG at fair value on a fully consolidated basis in Exelons and Generations Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 5Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the integration transaction. 
 Acquisitions 
 ConEdison Solutions. On September 1, 2016, Generation acquired the competitive retail electric and natural gas business activities of ConEdison Solutions, a subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc., for a purchase price of $257 million including net working capital of $204 million. The renewable energy, sustainable services and energy efficiency businesses of ConEdison were excluded from the transaction. 
 Integrys Energy Services, Inc. On November 1, 2014, Generation acquired the competitive retail electric and natural gas business activities of Integrys Energy Group, Inc. through the purchase of all of the stock of its wholly owned subsidiary, Integrys Energy Services, Inc. (Integrys) for a purchase price of $332 million, including net working capital. The generation and solar asset businesses of Integrys were excluded from the transaction. 
 Merger with Constellation Energy Group, Inc. On March 12, 2012, Constellation merged into Exelon with Exelon continuing as the surviving corporation pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger. Since the merger transaction, Generation includes the former Constellation generation and customer supply operations. 
Dispositions 
 Upstream Disposition. On June 16, 2016, Generation initiated the sales process of its Upstream business. See Note 14Debt and Credit Agreements for more information. In December 2016, Generation sold substantially all of the Upstream assets for $37 million which resulted in a pre-tax loss on sale of $10 million which is included in Gain(loss) on sales of assets on Exelons and Generations Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
 Asset Divestitures. During 2014 and 2015, Generation sold certain generating assets with total pre-tax proceeds of $1.8 billion (after-tax proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion). Proceeds were used primarily to finance a portion of the acquisition of PHI.

See Note 26Segment Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on revenues from external customers and revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for each of Generations reportable segments. 
 Nuclear Facilities 
 Generation has ownership interests in fourteen nuclear generating stations currently in service, consisting of 24 units with an aggregate of 19,457 MW of capacity. Generation wholly owns all of its nuclear generating stations, except for Quad Cities Generating Station (75% ownership), Peach Bottom Generating Station (50% ownership), and Salem Generating Station (Salem) (42.59% ownership), which are consolidated on Exelons and Generations financial statements relative to its proportionate ownership interest in each unit. In addition, Generation owns a 50.01% interest, collectively, in the CENG generating stations (Calvert Cliffs, Nine Mile Point [excluding LIPAs 18% ownership interest in Nine Mile Point Unit 2] and R.E. Ginna) which are 100% consolidated on Exelon and Generations financial statements as of April 1, 2014. See Note 5Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. See Note 3Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impact of the Future Energy Jobs Bill and New York CES on certain nuclear plants. 
 Generations nuclear generating stations are all operated by Generation, with the exception of the two units at Salem, which are operated by PSEG Nuclear, LLC (PSEG Nuclear), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of PSEG. In 2016, 2015 and 2014 electric supply (in GWh) generated from the nuclear generating facilities was 67%, 68% and 67%, respectively, of Generations total electric supply, which also includes fossil, hydroelectric and renewable generation and electric supply purchased for resale. The majority of this output was dispatched to support Generations wholesale and retail power marketing activities. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for further discussion of Generations electric supply sources. 
 On August 8, 2016, Generation executed a series of agreements with Entergy Nuclear FitzPatrick LLC (Entergy) to acquire the 838MW single-unit James A. FitzPatrick (FitzPatrick) nuclear generating station located in Scriba, New York. Closing of the transaction is currently anticipated to occur in the first half of 2017 and requires regulatory approval by FERC, NRC and the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC). The transaction is also subject to the notification and reporting requirements of the HSR Act (which has been completed) and other customary closing conditions. See Note 4Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on the proposed acquisition of the FitzPatrick nuclear generating station. 
 Nuclear Operations. Capacity factors, which are significantly affected by the number and duration of refueling and non-refueling outages, can have a significant impact on Generations results of operations. As the largest generator of nuclear power in the United States, Generation can negotiate favorable terms for the materials and services that its business requires. Generations operations from its nuclear plants have historically had minimal environmental impact and the plants have a safe operating history. 
 During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the nuclear generating facilities operated by Generation achieved capacity factors of 94.6%, 93.7% and 94.3%, respectively. The capacity factors reflect ownership percentage of stations operated by Generation and include CENG as of April 1, 2014. Generation manages its scheduled refueling outages to minimize their duration and to maintain high nuclear generating capacity factors, resulting in a stable generation base for Generations wholesale and retail 
 
12 
 
 marketing and trading activities. During scheduled refueling outages, Generation performs maintenance and equipment upgrades in order to minimize the occurrence of unplanned outages and to maintain safe, reliable operations. 
 In addition to the maintenance and equipment upgrades performed by Generation during scheduled refueling outages, Generation has extensive operating and security procedures in place to ensure the safe operation of the nuclear units. Generation has extensive safety systems in place to protect the plant, personnel and surrounding area in the unlikely event of an accident or other incident. 
 Regulation of Nuclear Power Generation. Generation is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC with respect to the operation of its nuclear generating stations, including the licensing for operation of each unit. The NRC subjects nuclear generating stations to continuing review and regulation covering, among other things, operations, maintenance, emergency planning, security and environmental and radiological aspects of those stations. As part of its reactor oversight process, the NRC continuously assesses unit performance indicators and inspection results, and communicates its assessment on a semi-annual basis. As of January 30, 2017, the NRC categorized Ginna in the Regulatory Response Column, which is the second highest of five performance bands. All other units operated by Generation are categorized in the Licensee Response Column, which is the highest performance band. The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke operating licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, the regulations under such Act or the terms of the operating licenses. Changes in regulations by the NRC may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures for nuclear generating facilities and/or increased operating costs of nuclear generating units. 
 For information on the NRC actions related to the Japan Earthquake and Tsunami and the industrys response, see ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExecutive Overview. 
 Licenses. Generation has original 40-year operating licenses from the NRC for each of its nuclear units and has received 20-year operating license renewals from the NRC for all its nuclear units except Clinton. Additionally, PSEG has received 20-year operating license renewals for Salem Units 1 and 2. On December 8, 2010, Exelon announced that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019.

(b) | Although timing has been delayed, Generation currently plans to seek license renewal for Clinton and has advised the NRC that any license renewal application would not be filed until the first quarter of 2021.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | In December 2010, Exelon announced that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019. In 2016, Exelon notified the NRC that it will cease operations at Oyster Creek on November 30, 2019.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | On June 7, 2016, Generation announced that it will submit a second 20 year license renewal application to NRC for Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3 in 2018.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The operating license renewal process takes approximately four to five years from the commencement of the renewal process until completion of the NRCs review. The NRC review process takes approximately two years from the docketing of an application. To date, each granted license renewal has been for 20 years beyond the original operating license expiration. Depreciation provisions are based on the estimated useful lives of the stations, which reflect the actual renewal of operating licenses for all of Generations operating nuclear generating stations except for Oyster Creek and Clinton. Oyster Creek depreciation provisions are based on the 2019 expected shutdown date. Clinton depreciation provisions are based on 2027 which is the last year of the Illinois Zero Emissions Standard. See Note 3Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on the new Illinois legislation and Note 9Early Nuclear Plant Retirements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on the reversal of the decision to early retire Clinton. 
 In August 2012, Generation entered into an operating services agreement with the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD) to provide operational and managerial support services for the Fort Calhoun Station and a licensing agreement for use of the Exelon Nuclear Management Model. On 
 
14 
 
 December 16, 2016, Generation was notified by OPPD of the termination of the operating services agreement for Fort Calhoun Station effective June 14, 2017. OPPD has the option to continue to use the Exelon Nuclear Management Model for payment of a fee. 
 Nuclear Waste Storage and Disposal. There are no facilities for the reprocessing or permanent disposal of SNF currently in operation in the United States, nor has the NRC licensed any such facilities. Generation currently stores all SNF generated by its nuclear generating facilities on-site in storage pools or in dry cask storage facilities. Since Generations SNF storage pools generally do not have sufficient storage capacity for the life of the respective plant, Generation has developed dry cask storage facilities to support operations. 
 As of December 31, 2016, Generation had approximately 77,900 SNF assemblies (19,200 tons) stored on site in SNF pools or dry cask storage (this includes SNF assemblies at Zion Station, for which Generation retains ownership even though the responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station has been assumed by another party; see Note 16Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Zion Station Decommissioning). All currently operating Generation-owned nuclear sites have on-site dry cask storage, except for Three Mile Island, where such storage is projected to be in operation in 2023. On-site dry cask storage in concert with on-site storage pools will be capable of meeting all current and future SNF storage requirements at Generations sites through the end of the license renewal periods and through decommissioning. 
 For a discussion of matters associated with Generations contracts with the DOE for the disposal of SNF, see Note 24Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 As a by-product of their operations, nuclear generating units produce LLRW. LLRW is accumulated at each generating station and permanently disposed of at licensed disposal facilities. The Federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 provides that states may enter into agreements to provide regional disposal facilities for LLRW and restrict use of those facilities to waste generated within the region. Illinois and Kentucky have entered into such an agreement, although neither state currently has an operational site and none is anticipated to be operational until after 2020. 
 Generation ships its Class A LLRW, which represents 93% of LLRW generated at its stations, to disposal facilities in Utah and South Carolina. The disposal facility in South Carolina at present is only receiving LLRW from LLRW generators in South Carolina, New Jersey (which includes Oyster Creek and Salem), and Connecticut. 
 Generation utilizes on-site storage capacity at all its stations to store and stage for shipping Class B and Class C LLRW. Generation has a contract through 2032 to ship Class B and Class C LLRW to a disposal facility in Texas. The agreement provides for disposal of all current Class B and Class C LLRW currently stored at each station as well as the Class B and Class C LLRW generated during the term of the agreement. However, because the production of LLRW from Generations nuclear fleet will exceed the capacity at the Texas site (3.9 million curies for 15 years beginning in 2012), Generation will still be required to utilize on-site storage at its stations for Class B and Class C LLRW. Generation currently has enough storage capacity to store all Class B and C LLRW for the life of all stations in Generations nuclear fleet. Generation continues to pursue alternative disposal strategies for LLRW, including an LLRW reduction program to minimize cost impacts and on-site storage. 
 Nuclear Insurance. Generation is subject to liability, property damage and other risks associated with major incidents at any of its nuclear stations, including the CENG nuclear stations. Generation has

 reduced its financial exposure to these risks through insurance and other industry risk-sharing provisions. See Nuclear Insurance within Note 24Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details. 
 For information regarding property insurance, see ITEM 2. PROPERTIESGeneration. Generation is self-insured to the extent that any losses may exceed the amount of insurance maintained or are within the policy deductible for its insured losses. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on Exelons and Generations future financial conditions and results of operations and cash flows. 
 Decommissioning. NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in specified minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExelon Corporation, Executive Overview; ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Nuclear Decommissioning, Asset Retirement Obligations and Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments; and Note 3Regulatory Matters, Note 12Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities and Note 16Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Generations NDT funds and its decommissioning obligations. The ultimate decommissioning obligation will be funded by the NDTs. The NDTs are recorded on Exelons and Generations Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2016 at fair value of approximately $11.1 billion and have an estimated targeted annual pre-tax return of 5.3% to 5.9%. 
 Zion Station Decommissioning. On December 11, 2007, Generation entered into an Asset Sale Agreement (ASA) with EnergySolutions, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, EnergySolutions, LLC (EnergySolutions) and ZionSolutions, LLC (ZionSolutions) under which ZionSolutions assumed responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station, which is located in Zion, Illinois and ceased operation in 1998. 
 On September 1, 2010, Generation and EnergySolutions completed the transactions contemplated by the ASA. Specifically, Generation transferred to ZionSolutions substantially all of the assets (other than land) associated with Zion Station, including assets held in related NDT funds. In consideration for Generations transfer of those assets, ZionSolutions assumed decommissioning and other liabilities, excluding the obligation to dispose of SNF, associated with Zion Station. Pursuant to the ASA, ZionSolutions will periodically request reimbursement from the Zion Station-related NDT funds for costs incurred related to the decommissioning efforts at Zion Station. However, ZionSolutions is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to request reimbursement; specifically, if certain milestones as defined in the ASA are not met, all or a portion of requested reimbursements shall be deferred until such milestones are met. See Note 16Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Zion Station Decommissioning and see Note 2Variable Interest Entities of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of variable interest entity considerations related to ZionSolutions. 
 Fossil and Renewable Facilities (including Hydroelectric) 
 At December 31, 2016, Generation had ownership interests in 13,263 MW of capacity in generating facilities currently in service, consisting of 9,522 MW of natural gas and oil, 3,715 MW of renewables (wind, hydroelectric, and solar) and 26 MW of waste coal. Generation wholly owns all of its fossil and renewable generating stations, with the exception of: (1) jointly owned facilities that include Wyman; (2) certain wind project entities with minority interest owners; and (3) an ownership interest in the Albany Green Energy, LLC project entity, see Note 2Variable Interest Entities of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding certain of these entities which are VIEs. Generations fossil and renewable generating stations are all operated by Generation, with the exception of LaPorte 
 
16 
 
 and Wyman, which are operated by third parties. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, electric supply (in GWh) generated from owned fossil and renewable generating facilities was 10%, 8% and 13%, respectively, of Generations total electric supply. The majority of this output was dispatched to support Generations wholesale and retail power marketing activities. For additional information regarding Generations electric generating facilities, see ITEM 2. PROPERTIESExelon Generation Company, LLC and ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExelon Corporation, Executive Overview for additional information on Generation Renewable Development. 
 Licenses. Fossil and renewable generation plants are generally not licensed, and, therefore, the decision on when to retire plants is, fundamentally, a commercial one. FERC has the exclusive authority to license most non-Federal hydropower projects located on navigable waterways or Federal lands, or connected to the interstate electric grid. On August 29, 2012 and August 30, 2012, Generation submitted hydroelectric license applications to the FERC for 46-year licenses for the Conowingo Hydroelectric Project (Conowingo) and the Muddy Run Pumped Storage Facility Project (Muddy Run), respectively. On December 22, 2015, FERC issued a new 40-year license for Muddy Run. The license term expires on December 1, 2055. Based on the FERC procedural schedule, the FERC licensing process was not completed prior to the expiration of Conowingos license on September 1, 2014. FERC is required to issue an annual license for the facility until the new license is issued. On September 10, 2014, FERC issued an annual license for Conowingo, effective as of the expiration of the previous license. If FERC does not issue a new license prior to the expiration of annual license, the annual license will renew automatically. The stations are currently being depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which includes actual and anticipated license renewal periods. Refer to Note 3Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Insurance. Generation maintains business interruption insurance for its renewable and fossil projects, and delay in start-up insurance for its renewable and fossil projects currently under construction. Generation does not purchase business interruption insurance for its wholly owned fossil and hydroelectric operations, unless required by financing agreements; see Note 14Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on financing agreements. Generation maintains both property damage and liability insurance. For property damage and liability claims for these operations, Generation is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on Exelons and Generations future financial conditions and their results of operations and cash flows. For information regarding property insurance, see ITEM 2. PROPERTIESExelon Generation Company, LLC.

----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | Includes wind, hydroelectric, and solar generating assets.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------

 The fuel costs per MWh for nuclear generation are less than those for fossil-fuel generation. Consequently, nuclear generation is generally the most cost-effective way for Generation to meet its wholesale and retail load servicing requirements. 
 The cycle of production and utilization of nuclear fuel includes the mining and milling of uranium ore into uranium concentrates, the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, the enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride and the fabrication of fuel assemblies. Generation has uranium concentrate inventory and supply contracts sufficient to meet all of its uranium concentrate requirements through 2018. Generations contracted conversion services are sufficient to meet all of its uranium conversion requirements through 2017. All of Generations enrichment requirements have been contracted through 2020. Contracts for fuel fabrication have been obtained through 2022. Generation does not anticipate difficulty in obtaining the necessary uranium concentrates or conversion, enrichment or fabrication services to meet the nuclear fuel requirements of its nuclear units. 
 Natural gas is procured through long-term and short-term contracts, as well as spot-market purchases. Fuel oil inventories are managed so that in the winter months sufficient volumes of fuel are 
 
18 
 
 available in the event of extreme weather conditions and during the remaining months to take advantage of favorable market pricing. 
 Generation uses financial instruments to mitigate price risk associated with certain commodity price exposures. Generation also hedges forward price risk, using both over-the-counter and exchange-traded instruments. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 13Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments. 
 Power Marketing 
 Generations integrated business operations include the physical delivery and marketing of power obtained through its generation capacity and through long-term, intermediate-term and short-term contracts. Generation maintains an effective supply strategy through ownership of generation assets and power purchase and lease agreements. Generation has also contracted for access to additional generation through bilateral long-term PPAs. PPAs, including tolling agreements, are commitments related to power generation of specific generation plants and/or are dispatchable in nature similar to asset ownership depending on the type of underlying asset. Generation secures contracted generation as part of its overall strategic plan, with objectives such as obtaining low-cost energy supply sources to meet its physical delivery obligations to both wholesale and retail customers and assisting customers to meet renewable portfolio standards. Generation sells electricity, natural gas, and other energy related products and solutions to various customers, including distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, and commercial, industrial, governmental, and residential customers in competitive markets. Generations customer facing operations combine a unified sales force with a customer-centric model that leverages technology to broaden the range of products and solutions offered, which Generation believes promotes stronger customer relationships. This model focuses on efficiency and cost reduction, which provides a platform that is scalable and able to capitalize on opportunities for future growth. 
 Generation may purchase more than the energy demanded by its customers. Generation then sells this open position, along with capacity not used to meet customer demand, in the wholesale electricity markets. Where necessary, Generation also purchases transmission service to ensure that it has reliable transmission capacity to physically move its power supplies to meet customer delivery needs in markets without an organized RTO. Generation also incorporates contingencies into its planning for extreme weather conditions, including potentially reserving capacity to meet summer loads at levels representative of warmer-than-normal weather conditions. 
 Price Supply Risk Management 
 Generation also manages the price and supply risks for energy and fuel associated with generation assets and the risks of power marketing activities. Generation implements a three-year ratable sales plan to align its hedging strategy with its financial objectives. Generation also enters into transactions that are outside of this ratable sales plan. Generation is exposed to commodity price risk in 2017 and beyond for portions of its electricity portfolio that are unhedged. Generation has been and will continue to be proactive in using hedging strategies to mitigate this risk in subsequent years. As of December 31, 2016, the percentage of expected generation hedged for the major reportable segments was 91%-94%, 56%-59% and 28%-31% for 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. Expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted generating facilities based upon a simulated dispatch model that 
 
19 
 
 makes assumptions regarding future market conditions, which are calibrated to market quotes for power, fuel, load following products, and options. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include economic hedges and certain non-derivative contracts, including sales to ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE to serve their retail load. A portion of Generations hedging strategy may be implemented through the use of fuel products based on assumed correlations between power and fuel prices, which routinely change in the market. The corporate risk management group and Exelons RMC monitor the financial risks of the wholesale and retail power marketing activities. Generation also uses financial and commodity contracts for proprietary trading purposes, but this activity accounts for only a small portion of Generations efforts. The proprietary trading portfolio is subject to a risk management policy that includes stringent risk management limits, including volume, stop-loss and value-at-risk limits, to manage exposure to market risk. See ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK for additional information. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Generations business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in nuclear fuel and energy generation assets and in other internal infrastructure projects. Generations estimated capital expenditures for 2017 are as follows: 

(in millions) | | 
Nuclear fuel (a) | $ | 925 
Growth | | 600 
Production plant | | 1,125
Total | $ | 2,650


(a) | Includes Generations share of the investment in nuclear fuel for the co-owned Salem plant.

 Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Services. The Utility Registrants are allowed to recover reasonable costs and fair and prudent capital expenditures associated with electric and natural gas distribution services and earn a return on those capital expenditures, subject to commission approval. ComEd recovers costs through a performance-based rate formula, pursuant to EIMA. ComEd is required to file an update to the performance-based rate formula on an annual basis. PECOs, BGEs and DPLs electric and gas distribution costs and Pepcos and ACEs electric distribution costs are recovered through traditional rate case proceedings. In certain instances, the Utility Registrants use specific recovery mechanisms as approved by their respective regulatory agencies. 
 ComEd, Pepco, and ACE customers have the choice to purchase electricity, and PECO, BGE, and DPL customers have the choice to purchase electricity and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers. The Utility Registrants remain the distribution service providers for all customers and are obligated to deliver electricity and natural gas to customers in their respective service territories while charging a regulated rate for distribution service. In addition, the Utility Registrants also retain significant default service obligations to provide electricity to certain groups of customers in their respective service areas who do not choose a competitive electric generation supplier. PECO and BGE also retain significant default service obligations to provide natural gas to certain groups of customers in their respective service areas who do not choose a competitive natural gas supplier. For natural gas, DPL does not retain default service obligations. For those customers that choose a competitive electric generation or natural gas supplier, the Utility Registrants may act as the billing agent but do not record revenues or purchased power and fuel expense related to the electricity and/or natural gas. For those customers that choose one of the Utility Registrants as their electric generation or natural gas supplier, the Utility Registrants are permitted to recover electric and natural gas procurement costs from retail customers. Therefore, fluctuations in electric and natural gas procurement costs have no impact on electric and natural gas revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense. 
 The following table outlines the state regulatory agencies and default service obligations for each of the Utility Registrants: 
 

 | Regulatory Agency | Default ServiceObligation-Electricity | Default ServiceObligation-Natural Gas
ComEd | ICC | POLR | n/a 
PECO | PAPUC | DSP | PGC 
BGE | MDPSC | SOS | MBR

(a) | In September 2015, the City of Chicago discontinued its participation in the customer choice program and began purchasing its electricity from ComEd. Approximately 670,000 customers were impacted by the City of Chicagos decision which resulted in the reduction in the number of customers participating in customer choice programs in 2015.

 Procurement-Related Proceedings. The Utility Registrants electric supply for its customers is primarily procured through contracts as required by the ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DPSC and NJBPU. The Utility Registrants procure electricity supply from various approved bidders, including Generation. Charges incurred for electric supply procured through contracts with Generation are included in Purchased power from affiliates on the Utility Registrants Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

PECOs, BGEs and DPLs natural gas supplies are purchased from a number of suppliers for terms of up to three years. PECO, BGE and DPL have annual firm supply and transportation contracts of 132,000 mmcf, 128,000 mmcf and 58,000 mmcf, respectively. In addition, to supplement gas supply at times of heavy winter demands and in the event of temporary emergencies, PECO, BGE and DPL have available storage capacity from the following sources: 
 

 | Peak Natural Gas Sources (in mmcf) | 
 | Liquefied NaturalGas Facility | | Propane-Air Plant | | Underground StorageService Agreements (a)
PECO | | 1,200 | | 150 | | 18,000
BGE | | 1,056 | | 550 | | 22,000
DPL | | 257 | | n/a | | 3,800 


(a) | Natural gas from underground storage represents approximately 28%, 46% and 34% of PECOs, BGEs and DPLs 2016-2017 heating season planned supplies, respectively.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 PECO, BGE and DPL have long-term interstate pipeline contracts and also participate in the interstate markets by releasing pipeline capacity or bundling pipeline capacity with gas for off-system sales. Off-system gas sales are low-margin direct sales of gas to wholesale suppliers of natural gas. Earnings from these activities are shared between the utilities and customers. PECO, BGE and DPL make these sales as part of a program to balance its supply and cost of natural gas. 
 Energy Efficiency Programs. The Utility Registrants are also allowed to recover costs associated with energy efficiency and demand response programs. Each commission approved program seeks to meet mandated electric consumption reduction targets and implement demand response measures to reduce peak demand. The programs are designed to meet standards required by each respective regulatory agency. 
 Capital Investment. The Utility Registrants businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments, primarily in electric transmission and distribution and natural gas transportation and distribution facilities, to ensure the adequate capacity, reliability and efficiency of their systems. ComEds, PECOs, BGEs, Pepcos, DPLs and ACEs most recent estimates of capital expenditures for plant additions and improvements for 2017 are $2,200 million, $775 million, $925 million, $625 million, $375 million and $300 million, respectively. 
 ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco and DPL have AMI smart meter and smart grid deployment programs within their respective service territories to enhance their distribution systems. PECO, BGE, Pepco and DPL have completed the installation and activation of smart meters in their respective service territories. ACE has yet to receive approval from the NJBPU to proceed with the installation of AMI smart meters. 
 Transmission Services. The Utility Registrants provide unbundled transmission service under rates approved by FERC. Under FERCs open access transmission policy promulgated in Order No. 888, the Utility Registrants, as owners of transmission facilities, are required to provide open access to their transmission facilities under filed tariffs at cost-based rates. The Utility Registrants and their affiliates are required to comply with FERCs Standards of Conduct regulation governing the communication of non-public transmission information between the transmission owners employees and wholesale merchant employees. 
 PJM is the regional grid operator and operates pursuant to FERC-approved tariffs. PJM is the transmission provider under, and the administrator of, the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff (PJM Tariff). PJM operates the PJM energy, capacity and other markets, and, through central dispatch, controls the day-to-day operations of the bulk power system for the PJM region. The Utility Registrants 
 
26 
 
 are members of PJM and provide regional transmission service pursuant to the PJM Tariff. The Utility Registrants and the other transmission owners in PJM have turned over control of their transmission facilities to PJM, and their transmission systems are under the dispatch control of PJM. Under the PJM Tariff, transmission service is provided on a region-wide, open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the PJM transmission owners at rates based on the costs of transmission service. 
 ComEds transmission rates are established based on a formula that was approved by FERC in January 2008. BGEs, Pepcos, DPLs and ACEs transmission rates are established based on a formula that was approved by FERC in April 2006. FERCs orders establish the agreed-upon treatment of costs and revenues in the determination of network service transmission rates and the process for updating the formula rate calculation on an annual basis. 
 PECOs customers are charged for PECOs PJM retail transmission services on a full and current basis through a Transmission Service Charge (applicable to default service only) and through a Non-Bypassable Transmission Charge (applicable to all distribution customers) in accordance with PECOs approved distribution rates. 
 See Note 3Regulatory Matters, Note 26Segment Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information regarding transmission services.

Environmental Regulation 
 General 
 The Registrants are subject to comprehensive and complex legislation regarding environmental matters by the federal government and various state and local jurisdictions in which they operate their facilities. The Registrants are also subject to regulations administered by the EPA and various state and local environmental protection agencies. Federal, state and local regulation includes the authority to regulate air, water, and solid and hazardous waste disposal. 
 The Exelon Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the management of environmental matters. Exelon has a management team to address environmental compliance and strategy, including the CEO; the Senior Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Chief Sustainability Officer; the Corporate Environmental Strategy Director and the Environmental Regulatory Strategy Director, as well as senior management of Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE. Performance of those individuals directly involved in environmental compliance and strategy is reviewed and affects compensation as part of the annual individual performance review process. The Exelon Board of Directors has delegated to its Corporate Governance Committee the authority to oversee Exelons compliance with laws and regulations and its strategies and efforts to protect and improve the quality of the environment, including Exelons climate change and sustainability policies and programs, as discussed in further detail below. The Exelon Board of Directors has also delegated to its Generation Oversight Committee the authority to oversee environmental, health and safety issues relating to Generation. The respective Boards of ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE oversee environmental, health and safety issues related to these companies. 
 Air Quality 
 Air quality regulations promulgated by the EPA and the various state and local environmental agencies in Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas in accordance with the Federal Clean Air Act impose restrictions on emission of particulates, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), mercury and other pollutants and require permits for operation of emissions sources. Such permits have been obtained by Exelons subsidiaries and must be renewed periodically. The Clean Air Act establishes a comprehensive and complex national program to substantially reduce air pollution from power plants. 
 See ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for additional information regarding clean air regulation in the forms of the CSAPR, the regulation of hazardous air pollutants from coal- and oil-fired electric generating facilities under MATS, and regulation of GHG emissions. 
 Water Quality 
 Under the Clean Water Act, NPDES permits for discharges into waterways are required to be obtained from the EPA or from the state environmental agency to which the permit program has been delegated and must be renewed periodically. Certain of Generations power generation facilities 
 
28 
 
 discharge industrial wastewater into waterways and are therefore subject to these regulations and operate under NPDES permits or pending applications for renewals of such permits after being granted an administrative extension. Generation is also subject to the jurisdiction of certain other state and regional agencies and compacts, including the Delaware River Basin Commission and the Susquehanna River Basin Commission. 
 Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act. Section 316(b) requires that the cooling water intake structures at electric power plants reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts, and is implemented through state-level NPDES permit programs. All of Generations power generation facilities with cooling water systems are subject to the regulations. Facilities without closed-cycle recirculating systems (e.g., cooling towers) are potentially most affected by any changes to the existing regulations. For Generation, those facilities are Calvert Cliffs, Clinton, Dresden, Eddystone, Fairless Hills, Ginna, Gould Street, Handley, Mountain Creek, Mystic 7, Nine Mile Point Unit 1, Peach Bottom, Quad Cities, Riverside and Salem. 
 On October 14, 2014, the EPAs final Section 316(b) rule became effective. The rule requires that a series of studies and analyses be performed to determine the best technology available to minimize adverse impacts on aquatic life, followed by an implementation period for the selected technology. The timing of the various requirements for each facility is related to the status of its current NPDES permit and the subsequent renewal period. There is no fixed compliance schedule, as this is left to the discretion of the state permitting director 
 Until the compliance requirements are determined by the applicable state permitting director on a site-specific basis for each plant, Generation cannot estimate the effect that compliance with the rule will have on the operation of its generating facilities and its future results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. Should a state permitting director determine that a facility must install cooling towers to comply with the rule, that facilitys economic viability could be called into question. However, the potential impact of the rule has been significantly reduced since the final rule does not mandate cooling towers as a national standard and sets forth technologies that are presumptively compliant, and the state permitting director is required to apply a cost-benefit test and can take into consideration site-specific factors. 
 Pursuant to discussions with the NJDEP in 2010 regarding the application of Section 316(b) to Oyster Creek, Generation agreed to permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019, ten years before the expiration of its operating license in 2029. The agreement only applies to Oyster Creek based on its unique circumstances and does not set any precedent for the ultimate compliance requirements for Section 316(b) at Exelons other plants. 
 New York Facilities. In July 2011, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) issued a policy regarding the best available technology for cooling water intake structures. Through its policy, the DEC established closed-cycle cooling or its equivalent as the performance goal for all existing facilities, but also provided that the DEC will select a feasible technology whose costs are not wholly disproportionate to the environmental benefits to be gained and allows for a site-specific determination where the entrainment performance goal cannot be achieved. The Ginna and Nine Mile Point Unit 1 power generation facilities received renewals of their state water discharge permits in 2014. 
 Salem. In June 2001, the NJDEP issued a renewed NPDES permit for Salem, expiring in July 2006, allowing for the continued operation of Salem with its existing cooling water system. In February 2006, PSEG filed a renewal application with the NJDEP allowing Salem to continue operating under its existing NPDES permit until a new permit is issued. On June 30, 2015, NJDEP issued a draft NPDES permit for Salem. The draft permit does not require installation of cooling towers and allows Salem to 
 
29 
 
 continue to operate utilizing the existing once-through cooling water system with certain required system modifications. On July 28, 2016, the NJDEP issued a final permit for Salem that did not require the installation of cooling towers. However, the permit is being challenged by an environmental organization, and if successful, could result in additional costs for Clean Water Act compliance. 
 Solid and Hazardous Waste 
 CERCLA provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the EPA in the event of threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment and authorizes the EPA either to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have created actual or potential environmental hazards or to order persons responsible for the situation to do so. Under CERCLA, generators and transporters of hazardous substances, as well as past and present owners and operators of hazardous waste sites, are strictly, jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs of waste at sites, most of which are listed by the EPA on the National Priorities List (NPL). These PRPs can be ordered to perform a cleanup, can be sued for costs associated with an EPA-directed cleanup, may voluntarily settle with the EPA concerning their liability for cleanup costs, or may voluntarily begin a site investigation and site remediation under state oversight prior to listing on the NPL. Various states, including Delaware, District of Colombia, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, have also enacted statutes that contain provisions substantially similar to CERCLA. In addition, RCRA governs treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and cleanup of sites where such activities were conducted. 
 Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE and their subsidiaries are, or are likely to become, parties to proceedings initiated by the EPA, state agencies and/or other responsible parties under CERCLA and RCRA with respect to a number of sites, including MGP sites, or may undertake to investigate and remediate sites for which they may be subject to enforcement actions by an agency or third-party. 
 See Note 24Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding solid and hazardous waste regulation and legislation. 
 Environmental Remediation 
 ComEds, PECOs and BGEs environmental liabilities primarily arise from contamination at former MGP sites. ComEd, pursuant to an ICC order, and PECO, pursuant to settlements of natural gas distribution rate cases with the PAPUC, have an on-going process to recover environmental remediation costs of the MGP sites through a provision within customer rates. While BGE does not have a rider for MGP clean-up costs, BGE has historically received recovery of actual clean-up costs on a site-specific basis in distribution rates. The amount to be expended in 2017 at Exelon for compliance with environmental remediation related to contamination at former MGP sites and other gas purification sites is expected to total $41 million, consisting of $35 million and $6 million respectively, at ComEd and PECO. 
 Generations environmental liabilities primarily arise from contamination at current and former generation and waste storage facilities. As of December 31, 2016, Generation has established appropriate contingent liabilities for potential environmental remediation requirements including contamination attributable to low level radioactive residues at a storage and reprocessing facility named Latty Avenue, and at a disposal facility named West Lake Landfill, both near St. Louis, Missouri related to operations conducted by Cotter Corporation, a former ComEd subsidiary. 
 The Utility Registrants also have environmental liabilities for remediation considerations. As of December 31, 2016, Generation has established appropriate contingent liabilities for potential environmental remediation requirements. 
 
30 
 
In addition, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE may be required to make significant additional expenditures not presently determinable for other environmental remediation costs. 
 See Notes 3Regulatory Matters and 24Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Registrants environmental remediation efforts and related impacts to the Registrants results of operations, cash flows and financial positions. 
 Global Climate Change 
 Exelon has utility and generation assets, and customers, that are subject to the effects of climate change as described in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report, published in 2014, Accordingly the company is engaged in a variety of initiatives to better understand and develop responses to these issues, including investments in resiliency, partnering with federal, state and local governments and advocating for science-based public policy. Exelon, as a producer of electricity from predominantly low-carbon generating facilities (such as nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar photovoltaic), has a relatively small greenhouse gas (GHG) emission profile, or carbon footprint, compared to other domestic generators of electricity. By virtue of its significant investment in low-carbon intensity assets, Generations emission intensity, or rate of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emitted per unit of electricity generated, is among the lowest in the industry. Exelon does produce GHG emissions, primarily at its fossil fuel-fired generating plants (primarily natural gas); CO2, methane and nitrous oxide are all emitted in this process, with CO2 representing the largest portion of these GHG emissions. GHG emissions from combustion of fossil fuels represented the majority of Exelons direct GHG emissions in 2016, although less than 30 percent of its owned generating capacity utilizes fossil fuels with less than 10 percent of owned generation MWh actually produced by fossil fuels as Exelons fossil-fired generation is primarily intermediate and peaking in nature. Other GHG emission sources at Exelon include natural gas (methane) leakage on the natural gas systems, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) leakage in its electric transmission and distribution operations and refrigerant leakage from its chilling and cooling equipment as well as fossil fuel combustion in its motor vehicles and fossil fuel generation of electricity used to power its facilities. Despite its focus on low-carbon generation, Exelon believes its operations could be significantly affected by the possible physical risks of climate change and by mandatory programs to reduce GHG emissions. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for information regarding the market and financial, regulatory and legislative, and operational risks associated with climate change. 
 Climate Change Regulation. Exelon is or may become subject to climate change regulation or legislation at the Federal, regional and state levels. 
 International Climate Change Regulation. At the international level, the United States is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Paris Agreement at the 21st session of the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP 21) on December 12, 2015. The Paris Agreement defines the UNFCCCs objective of limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. All Parties are required to develop their own national emission reductions and to update those reductions at least every five years. The Developed Country Parties, including the United States, are required to take the lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets. The United States had previously submitted its national emission reductions to achieve a 2020 target of reducing net emissions to 17% below the 2005 level and to achieve net greenhouse gas emission reductions of 26%28% below the 2005 level by 2025. The United States has indicated that it intends to achieve these reductions through a variety of mechanisms, including regulations to cut carbon pollution from new and existing power plants. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016 the thirtieth day after the date on which at 
 
31 
 
 least 55 Parties accounting for at least an estimated 55% of total global greenhouse gas emissions ratified the Agreement. The Agreement has not been ratified by the US Senate and it is uncertain whether or not or to what extent the new Trump Administration will pursue the established target. 
 Federal Climate Change Legislation and Regulation. It is highly uncertain that Federal legislation to reduce GHG emissions will be enacted. If such legislation is adopted, Exelon may incur costs either to further limit or offset the GHG emissions from its operations or to procure emission allowances or credits. 
 Under the Obama Administration, the EPA proposed and finalized regulations for new and modified fossil-fuel power plants under Section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act and Section 111(d) for existing fossil-fuel power plants. These regulations are currently being litigated. The 111(d) regulations, referred to as the Clean Power Plan, are currently subject to a stay by the Supreme Court, pending conclusion of all litigation at both the D.C. Circuit and Supreme Court levels. The D.C. Circuit heard en banc oral argument in late September 2016, but has not yet issued its decision. Prior to the stay, the Clean Power Plan had established GHG emission reduction targets for each state, with emission reductions slated to begin in 2022. State requirements to submit plans to EPA in September 2016 (or within two years if an extension was requested) were placed in abeyance pending results of litigation. 
 President Trumps election platform called for eliminating a number of EPA regulations, including the Clean Power Plan. Due to the need to appoint and confirm key EPA officials as the Trump Administration begins to govern, the specific details of the Trump Administrations plans to address the Clean Power Plan are not known. In the interim, the D.C. Circuit continues its review of the regulation under existing litigation and is expected to issue its decision in the first half of 2017. 
 Due to current litigation and the need for the new Administration to develop its approach to dealing with the Clean Power plan, Exelon and Generation cannot at this time predict the future of the Clean Power Plan or individual state responses to Clean Power Plan developments or how developments will impact their future financial positions, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Regional and State Climate Change Legislation and Regulation. After a two-year program review, the nine northeast and mid-Atlantic states currently participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Initiative (RGGI) released an updated RGGI Model Rule and Program Review Recommendations Summary on February 7, 2013. Under the updated RGGI program the regional RGGI CO2 budget was reduced, starting in 2014, from its previous 165 million ton level to 91 million tons, with a 25 percent reduction in the cap level each year from 2015 through 2020. Included in the program are provisions for cost containment reserve (CCR) allowances, which will become available if the total demand for allowances, above the CCR trigger price, exceeds the number of CO2 allowances available for purchase at auction. (CCR trigger prices are $6 in 2015, $8 in 2016 and $10 in 2017; after 2017 the CCR price increases by 2.5 percent each year). Allowance prices in 2016 remained below the applicable CCR trigger price, indicating program costs remained within the boundaries of costs acceptable to participating states. During 2016, RGGI began its quadrennial review process to determine what, if any, program design amendments should be pursued for the regional program. A series of stakeholder calls occurred in 2016, which included discussion around potential linkage issues with the federal Clean Power Plan, linkages to state GHG emission reduction goals/programs, functioning of cost containment mechanisms, and consideration of whether future cap levels should be adjusted for the post-2020 period. RGGI intends to complete its program review in early 2017. 
 On December 18, 2009, Pennsylvania issued the states final Climate Change Action Plan. The plan sets as a target a 30 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2020. The Climate Change Advisory Committee continues to meet quarterly to review Climate Action Work Plans for the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. The Climate Change Action Plan does not impose any requirements on Generation or PECO at this time. 
 
32 
 
The Maryland Commission on Climate Change was chartered in 2007 and released a greenhouse gas reduction strategy with 42 recommendations on August 27, 2008. The plans primary policy recommendation to formally adopt science-based regulatory goals to reduce Marylands green house gas emissions (GHG) was realized with the passage of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Act of 2009 (GGRA) which required Maryland to reduce its GHG emissions by 25 percent below 2006 levels by 2020. It also directed the Maryland Department of Environment to prepare and implement an action plan which listed Marylands electricity consumption reduction goals, required under the EmPOWER Maryland program, and mandatory State participation in RGGI Program, as the energy sectors contribution to the plan. In April 2016, the Governor of Maryland signed the GGRA of 2016 into law, which updated the states Climate Commission charter. It expanded membership to include more non-governmental members and established an enhanced statewide GHG emissions reduction target of 40 percent from 2006 levels by 2030, maintaining the caveats from the 2007 legislation that the implementation have a net positive impact on both jobs and the economy. MDE is currently working on plans to meet the 2016 GGRA requirements. In February of this year (2017) , the Maryland General Assembly overrode Maryland Governor Hogans veto of legislation that requires the current Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to be accelerated and enhanced. The law requires the RPS, previously set at 20% renewables by 2022, with a 2% solar carve out, to move to 25% renewables by 2020 with a 2.5% solar carve out. 
 Exelons Voluntary Climate Change Efforts. In a world increasingly concerned about global climate change and regulatory action to reduce GHG, Exelons low-carbon generating fleet is seen by management as a competitive advantage. Exelon remains one of the largest, lowest carbon electric generators in the United States: nuclear for base load, natural gas for marginal and peak demand, hydro and pumped storage, and supplemental wind and solar renewables. As further legislation and regulation imposing requirements on emissions of GHG and air pollutants are promulgated, Exelons low-carbon, low-emission generation fleet will position the company to benefit from its comparative advantage over other generation fleets. 
 Renewable and Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards 
 Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia have adopted some form of RPS requirement. Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of Columbia, Delaware and New Jersey have laws specifically addressing energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives. In addition to state level activity, RPS legislation has been considered and may be considered again in the future by the United States Congress. Also, states that currently do not have RPS requirements may adopt such legislation in the future. 
 In Illinois, in accordance with legislation in effect on December 31, 2016, the IPAs Procurement Plans include the procurement of cost-effective renewable energy resources in amounts that equal or exceed a minimum target percentage of the total electricity that each electric utility supplies to its eligible retail customers. The June 1, 2016 target renewable energy resources obligation for the utilities was at least 11.5%. This obligation increases by at least 1.5% each year thereafter to an ultimate target of at least 25% by June 1, 2025. All goals are subject to rate impact criteria set forth by Illinois legislation. As of December 31, 2016, ComEd had purchased renewable energy resources or equivalents, such as RECs, in accordance with the IPA Procurement Plan. ComEd currently retires all RECs upon transfer and acceptance. ComEd is permitted to recover procurement costs of RECs from retail customers without mark-up through rates. 
 In accordance with FEJA that takes effect on June 1, 2017, beginning with the plan or plans to be implemented in the 2017 delivery year, the IPA shall develop a long term renewable resources procurement plan (LT Plan). The RPS target percentages for the overall service territory have not changed through June 1, 2025 (11.5% of retail load by June 1 2016 growing to 25% by June 1 2025) although FEJA extended the 25% RPS target to delivery years after 2025. Currently, each Retail 
 
33 
 
 Electric Supplier and each utility is responsible for the renewable resource obligation for the customers to which it supplies power. Over time, this will change and the utility will procure renewable resources based on the retail load of substantially all customers in its service territory. For the delivery year beginning June 1, 2017, the LT Plan shall include cost effective renewable energy resources procured by the utility for the retail load the utility supplies and for 50% of the retail customer load supplied by Retail Electric Suppliers in the utility service territory on February 28, 2017. Utility procurement for RES supplied retail customer load will increase to 75% June 1, 2018 and to 100% beginning June 1, 2019. 
 Originally passed November 30, 2004 the AEPS Act became effective for PECO on January 1, 2011. During 2016, PECO was required to supply approximately 5.5% of electric energy generated from Tier I alternative energy resources (including solar, wind power, low-impact hydropower, geothermal energy, biologically derived methane gas, fuel cells, biomass energy, coal mine methane and black liquor generated within Pennsylvania), as measured in AECs, through May 31, 2016 and subsequently 6.0% beginning June 1, 2016 and continuing through May 31, 2017. PECO is also required to supply 8.2% of electric energy generated from Tier II alternative energy resources (including waste coal, demand-side management, large-scale hydropower, municipal solid waste, generation of electricity utilizing wood and by-products of the pulping process and wood, distributed generation systems and integrated combined coal gasification technology), as measured in AECs, effective June 1, 2015 and continuing through May 31, 2020. The compliance requirements will incrementally escalate to 8.0% for Tier I and 10.0% for Tier II by 2021. In order to comply with these requirements, PECO purchases its AECs through its DSP Program full requirement contracts with various counterparties, including Generation. PECO also obtains AECs of Solar Tier I annually from long term agreements with various counterparties, including Generation, and balancing amounts of Tier 1 non-solar and Tier II through broker purchases. 
 Section 7-703 of the Public Utilities Article in Maryland sets forth the RPS requirement, which applies to all retail electricity sales in Maryland by electricity suppliers. The RPS requirement requires that suppliers obtain a specified percentage of the electricity it sells from Tier 1 sources (solar, wind, biomass, methane, geothermal, ocean, fuel cell, small hydroelectric, and poultry litter) and Tier 2 sources (hydroelectric, other than pump storage generation, and waste-to-energy). The RPS requirement began in 2006, requiring that suppliers procure 1.0% and 2.5% from Tier 1 and Tier 2 sources, respectively, escalating in 2022 to 22.0% from Tier 1 sources, including at least 2.0% from solar energy, and a phase out of Tier 2 resource options by 2022. In 2015, 10.5% was required from Tier 1 renewable sources, including at least 0.5% derived from solar energy and 2.5% from Tier 2 renewable sources. BGE, Pepco and DPL are subject to requirements established by the Public Utilities Article in Maryland related to the use of alternative energy resources. In addition, the wholesale suppliers that supply power to BGE, Pepco and DPL through SOS procurement auctions have the obligation, by contract with BGE, Pepco and DPL, to meet the RPS requirements. 
 Section 34-1432 of the D.C. Code sets forth the RPS requirement, which applies to all retail electricity sales in the District of Columbia by electricity suppliers. The RPS requirement requires that suppliers obtain a specified percentage of the electricity it sells from Tier 1 sources (solar, wind, certain qualifying biomass, methane from anaerobia decomposition of organic materials in landfill or wastewater treatment plant, geothermal, ocean, and fuel cell) and Tier 2 sources (hydroelectric (other than pumped storage generation), certain qualifying biomass and waste-to-energy). The RPS requirement began in 2007, with standards increasing annually. For 2017, the RPS requires that suppliers procure 13.1% and 2.5% from Tier 1 and Tier 2 sources, respectively, with not less than 0.95% solar, and escalating in 2023 to 20.0% from Tier 1 sources, including at least 2.5% from solar energy, and a phase out of Tier 2 resource options. In 2015 the law was amended to extend the RPS requirements to 2032, at which time not less than 50% is required from Tier 1 renewable sources, including at least 5.0% derived from solar energy. Tier 2 renewable sources remain phased out. The wholesale suppliers that supply power to Pepco through SOS procurement auctions have the obligation, by contract with Pepco, to meet the RPS requirements.

Title 26 of the Delaware Code sets forth the RPS requirement, which applies to retail electricity sales in Delaware by electricity suppliers. The RPS requirement requires that DPL obtain a specified percentage of the electricity it delivers to its eligible customers from eligible energy resources (solar electric, wind, ocean tidal, ocean thermal, fuel cells powered by renewable fuels, hydroelectric facilities with a maximum capacity of 30 MW, sustainable biomass, anaerobic digestion and landfill gas). The RPS requirement, beginning in 2007, required that suppliers procure 2.0% from eligible energy resources, with not less than 0.011% from solar, and escalating annually through 2025, at which time suppliers must procure 25.0% from eligible energy resources, including at least 3.5% from solar. As of December 31, 2016, DPL is a party to three land-based wind power purchase agreements in the aggregate amount of 128 MWs (nameplate capacity). DPL has contracted for approximately 48 MW of Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) through a combination of long term SREC purchase agreements with solar facilities, SREC Purchase agreements with the Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility and the DE SREC Procurement Program. On October 18, 2011, the DPSC approved a tariff submitted by DPL in accordance with the requirements of the RPS specific to a fuel cell facility totaling 30 MWs to be constructed by a qualified fuel cell provider. The tariff and the RPS establish that DPL acts solely as an agent to collect payments in advance from its distribution customers and remit them to the qualified fuel cell provider for each MWh of energy produced by the fuel cell facilities through 2033. The qualified fuel cell provider output reduces the non-solar and/or solar requirements needed to satisfy the Delaware RPS obligations. 
 The Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act, (EDECA), was signed into law in 1999, and includes the requirement for compliance with New Jerseys RPS by electric power suppliers and providers of BGS. The RPS requires that electric power suppliers obtain a specified percentage of the electricity they sell from Class I sources (solar, wind, wave/tidal action, geothermal, methane captured from landfills, fuel cells with certain types of power sources, and biomass) and Class II sources (hydroelectric facilities with a combined design capacity of less than 30 MW, and certain resource recovery facilities). In 2010, the Solar Energy Advancement and Fair Competition Act, (SEAFCA), was signed into law. SEAFCA amended several provisions of EDECA, among them the manner in which suppliers were to comply with the solar portion of the RPS. SEAFCA, beginning in energy year 2011, set out a specific requirement for solar energy generation. The Solar Act of 2012 made further changes effective for energy year 2014 and beyond. The RPS requirement has changed over time. For energy year 2005, suppliers were required to procure 0.74% and 2.5% from Class I and Class II sources, respectively. For the most recently completed energy year 2016, 9.649% was required from Class I renewable sources, 2.5% from Class II renewable sources, and 2.75% from solar energy. As noted above, the RPS applies to each supplier or provider that sells electricity to retail customers in New Jersey. Pursuant to Section 14:4-1.2 of the New Jersey Administrative Code, electric public utilities, such as ACE, that provide electric generation services only for the purpose of providing BGS are not electric power suppliers and so are not subject to the RPS procurement requirements. 
 Similar to ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE, Generations retail electric business must source a portion of the electric load it serves in many of the states in which it does business from renewable resources or approved equivalents such as RECs. Potential regulation and legislation regarding renewable and alternative energy resources could increase the pace of development of wind and other renewable/alternative energy resources, which could put downward pressure on wholesale market prices for electricity in some markets where Exelon operates generation assets. At the same time, such developments may present some opportunities for sales of Generations renewable power, including from wind, solar, hydroelectric and landfill gas.
