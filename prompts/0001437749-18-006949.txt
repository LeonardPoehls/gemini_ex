Cautionary Note Regarding Industry Data
 
Unless otherwise indicated, information contained in this Annual Report concerning our Company, our business, the services we provide and intend to provide, our industry and our general expectations concerning our industry are based on management estimates. Such estimates are derived from publicly available information released by third party sources, as well as data from our internal research, and reflect assumptions made by us based on such data and our knowledge of the industry, which we believe to be reasonable.
Background
 
CEN Biotech, Inc. (“CEN” or the “Company”) is a Canadian holding company, incorporated in Canada on August 4, 2013 as a subsidiary of Creative Edge Nutrition, Inc. (“Creative”), a Nevada corporation. Creative separated its planned specialty pharmaceutical business located in Canada by transferring substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the planned specialty pharmaceutical business to CEN and effecting a distribution (“Spin Off Distribution”) of CEN common stock to Creative shareholders on February 29, 2016. The Spin-Off Distribution was expected to be tax free for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.
 
Prior to the Spin Off Distribution, CEN initially pursued the cannabis business in Canada and obtained funding to build the initial phase of its comprehensive seed-to-sale facility and applied to obtain a license in Canada to begin operating its state-of-the-art medical marijuana cultivation, processing, and distribution facility in Lakeshore, Ontario. On March 11, 2015, the Company’s application for a license to produce marijuana for medical purposes was formally rejected by Canadian regulatory authority. On February 1, 2016 the Company commenced legal action against the Attorney General of Canada in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for damages for detrimental reliance, economic loss, and prejudgment and post judgment interest, costs of the proceeding and other relief that the court may seem just.  As of April 16, 2018 the action in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice is still ongoing.  In the meantime the Company decided to develop and pursue other businesses that are related to the cannabis and other industries including Light Emitting Diode (“LED”) lighting.
 
Overview

We are focused on the manufacturing, production and development of products within the cannabis industry, including the lighting technology, hemp products and medical marijuana. The Company intends to explore the usage of hemp, which it intends to cultivate for usage in industrial, medical and food products.
 
The Company has acquired a patent related to LED Lighting and intends to explore development opportunities of the LED lighting technology across manufacturing operations and intends to explore licensing opportunities across industries such as the horticultural industry, including for the purpose of growing marijuana, as well as the automotive, industrial and commercial lighting industries.     
 
The Company is in contract to acquire a 51% interest in Cen Ukraine LLC (“CEN Ukraine”), which currently holds a license, granted by the federal government of Ukraine, for the cultivation and processing of cannabis sativa for industrial, supplement, pharmaceutical and other purposes in Ukraine. After closing this acquisition, the Company intends to explore the usage of hemp, which it intends to cultivate for usage in industrial, medical and food products. In addition, the Company intends to explore the development of medicinal marijuana outside of the United States.
 
Hemp is related to cannabis as both are classified under the same botanical category of Cannabis sativa L. A significant difference between the two is that recreational cannabis has significant amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (5–20%), a psychotropic cannabinoid and very little amounts of CBD (cannabidiol) and CBG (cannabigerol), which have no psychotropic properties; whereas industrial hemp has virtually no THC (less than 0.3%). This 0.3% THC in industrial hemp is not enough to provide psychotropic effects, which renders industrial hemp useless for recreational use or abuse. Canada, China and the United Kingdom are examples of major industrialized countries that have grown industrial hemp responsibly deriving maximum economic benefits from its cultivation.
 
Hemp is a plant easy to cultivate, with predictable harvests and produces overall negative carbon print compared to other agricultural sources used for production of biodiesels among other uses. Industrial hemp is rich in proteins and essential amino acids, which may render it as a preferred source of food and animal feed.

LED Lighting 
 
On September 12, 2016, the Company executed an agreement to acquire a patent related to LED Lighting, from Tesla Digital, Inc., a Canadian Corporation and Stevan Pokrajac. As part of the transaction the Company will employ Stevan Pokrajak in connection with the development of the acquired technology. The patent intangible remains in escrow in the name of Tesla Digital, Inc. until full settlement of the terms of the agreement. In the interim, CEN has the rights to use the patented technology. In connection with the acquisition the Company will issue one million common shares.
 
The Company intends to explore using the LED Lighting across manufacturing operations and licensing opportunities across multiple industries such as the horticultural industry, including for the purpose of growing marijuana, as well as the automotive, industrial and commercial lighting industries.
 
Hemp and Medical Marijuana 
 
On December 14, 2017, the Company entered into a Controlling Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Bill Chaaban, our President and Chairman, and Usamakh Saadikh (the “Sellers”) to acquire (the “Acquisition”) 51% of the outstanding equity interests in Cen Ukraine, a corporation that was organized and has its principal offices in Ukraine. The agreement, which is subject to certain conditions, has not closed as of April 16, 2018. Cen Ukraine was founded to seek agricultural and pharmaceutical opportunities in Ukraine. Cen Ukraine currently holds a license, granted by the federal government of Ukraine, for the cultivation and processing of cannabis sativa for industrial, supplement, pharmaceutical and other purposes in Ukraine. The consideration will be paid by issuing common shares of the Company.
 
The Company intends, through Cen Ukraine, to explore the usage of hemp, which it intends to cultivate for usage in industrial, medical and food products. In addition, the Company intends to explore the development of medicinal marijuana outside of the United States.
 
The Company’s initial plans for the development of non-marijuana grade hemp include targeting the automotive industry to supply hemp fiber, and investigating other industrial applications, and developing Hemp nutritional supplement and beverage products for the distribution through the extensive Ukrainian pharmacy network.
 
Industrial hemp has many uses, including paper, textiles, biodegradable plastics, construction, health food, and fuel. It also runs parallel with the "Green Future" objectives that are becoming increasingly popular. Hemp requires little to no pesticides or herbicides, controls erosion of the topsoil, and produces oxygen. Furthermore, hemp can be used to replace many potentially harmful products, such as tree paper (the processing of which uses chlorine bleach, which results in the waste product polychlorinated dibensodioxins, popularly known as dioxins, which are carcinogenic, and contribute to deforestation, cosmetics, and plastics, most of which are petroleum-based and do not decompose easily. The strongest chemical needed to whiten the already light hemp paper is non-toxic hydrogen peroxide.
 
In addition, the Company intends to explore the development of legal medicinal marijuana outside of the United States.
 
Healthcare practitioner engagement and education will be the primary focus of CEN’s outreach strategy. Educational programs will include studies and outlets for healthcare practitioners and patients to receive treatment advice in integrative medicine centers. Healthcare practitioners will be engaged by CEN to co-host educational seminars throughout Canada, further advancing and bringing awareness to the benefits of medical marihuana treatments.
 
Raw Materials and Components
 
We intend to utilize strategic partners, contract manufacturers, and/or other third-party suppliers for the production of our LED Lighting Products. The raw materials and supplies required for the production of our lighting products may be available, in some instances from one supplier, and in other instances, from multiple suppliers. In those cases where raw materials are only available through one supplier, such supplier may be either a sole source (the only recognized supply source available to us) or a single source (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We, our strategic partners, contract manufacturers, and/or other third-party suppliers will adopt appropriate policies to attempt, to the extent feasible, to minimize our raw material supply risks, including maintenance of greater levels of raw materials inventory and implementation of multiple raw materials sourcing strategies, especially for critical raw materials. Although to date we have not experienced any significant delays in obtaining any raw materials from suppliers, we cannot provide assurance that we, our strategic partners, contract manufacturers, and/or other third-party suppliers will not face shortages from one or more of them in the future.

Research and Development
 
The Company contracts with Stevan Pokrajak, the developer of the patented LED Lighting Technology, to assist the Company with the development of the acquired technology. As part of the acquisition Mr. Pokrajak will become an employee of the LED subsidiary with compensation of $200,000 per year commencing with the start of operations.
Competition
 
We expect that our LED Lighting Products will compete against a variety of lighting products, including conventional light sources such as compact fluorescent lamps and High Intensity Discharge (“HID”) lamps, as well as other LED lighting products. Our ability to compete depends substantially upon the superior performance and lower total cost of ownership of our products. We anticipate that the competition for our products will also come from new technologies that offer increased energy efficiency, lower maintenance costs, and/or advanced features. We expect to compete with LED systems produced by large lighting companies, as well as smaller manufacturers or distributors. Some of these competitors offer products with performance characteristics similar to those of our products.
Customers
 
We currently do not have any customer for our LED Lighting Products.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
On September 12, 2016, the Company executed an agreement to acquire assets, including patented LED Lighting, from Tesla Digital, Inc. (a Canadian corporation) and Stevan (Steve) Pokrajac. The patent intangible remains in escrow in the name of Tesla Digital, Inc. until full settlement of the terms of the agreement. In the interim, CEN has the rights to use the patented technology. In connection with the acquisition the Company will issue one million common shares.
 
The Company plans to explore manufacturing operations and licensing opportunities across multiple industries such as horticultural, automotive, industrial and commercial lighting. The assets acquired other than the patent included old machinery and raw materials. The Company has assigned no value to these since their value was not relevant to or calculated in the Company’s offer for acquisition.
 
Employees 
 
We have four full time employees and no part time employees. We engage consultants to provide us with the services we need to plan and develop our facilities and products.
