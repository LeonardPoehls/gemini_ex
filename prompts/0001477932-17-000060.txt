In December of 2016, Telehealthcare signed Exclusive Reseller Agreement with Re-Habit, Inc. for the licensing and resell of CarePanda Secure Messaging App to the Detox and Residential Treatment industry. The Detox and Residential Treatment Centers are under increased regulatory pressure to meet Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance. Some centers are even required to meet Joint Commission: Accreditation, Health Care, Certification (JCAHO) for the retention and storage of healthcare communication to continue their operations and association with hospitals, Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and insurance providers.

In California alone, there are over 1,000+ Detox and Rehabilitation facilities. As of December 2016, Re-Habit has already registered several facilities into pilot programs with a goal of 100 facilities for 2017. 

Per Telehealthcare’s Press Release on December 14, 2016:

Telehealthcare, Inc. Announces Exclusive Reseller Agreement for CarePanda HIPAA Compliant Messaging App

"CarePanda offers the opportunity for Rehabilitation facilities to meet current HIPAA and JCAHO regulations." Stated Re-Habit's COO Mathew Alaimo. "Alcohol and drug addiction is a major problem in this country and people recovering from this disease often have their medical information exposed to employers or friends without their consent. With CarePanda, rehab facilities can not only meet regulatory and security compliance but also automate their business operations and introduce new business services such as remote communication with medical staff, nurses, labs, pharmacies and others. The result is improved tracking and management of medical events and activities."

CarePanda secure messaging app is available for both Apple and Android mobile and tablet devices. CarePanda can be used in any medical setting including hospitals, medical groups, long term settings, pharmacies, labs, imaging, billing, nurse stations, emergency rooms, and even from home or the medical office.

CarePanda App is the first step of securing communication between medical providers, doctors, patients, labs, pharmacist and many others. By creating an ecosystem of providers, vendors and patients on the CarePanda App, Telehealthcare will be able to leverage the user base for additional revenue opportunities. The ecosystem will also provide a basis of customers and services that the company can work with as new regulations get passed in the Telehealthcare space.

Our Market

Healthcare Ecosystem

The healthcare ecosystem is undergoing major changes. This includes:


· | New regulatory changes with “Obama Care”
--+-----------------------------------------


· | Aging population
--+-----------------


· | Increasing healthcare costs
--+----------------------------


· | Growing shortage of healthcare resources
--+-----------------------------------------


· | Source of healthcare provisioning is changing (e.g., retail health e)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Quality of care is becoming more important
--+-------------------------------------------


· | More technology and more people are being added to the system
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | Smart devices, tablets, phones and WiFi devices make it easier to monitor and collect healthcare information.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Millions of Americans have at least one chronic care condition. Anyone who has a loved one with a chronic condition or extended healthcare issue knows the difficulty of managing, monitoring and communicating their care between family members, caregivers and other medical providers.

Problem for Consumers - You Own Your Healthcare Record

Under new medical guidelines consumers now own their own healthcare record which presents several challenges:


· | How will you collect and manage your healthcare information?
--+-------------------------------------------------------------
· | How will you access it? 
· | How will you share it with family members or caregivers? 
· | How will you secure it? 


CarePanda will attempt to make it easy for family’s to collect health information anywhere and everywhere they go via mobile phone, iPAD, computer, fax, email or Internet kiosk. In addition, CarePanda will make it easy to capture the information customers need, store it for future reference and share it with others including family members, caregivers, medical professionals, legal, other family members and more.

CarePanda works by a customer creating an online account and entering their healthcare information into online forms or uploading their medical information documents into their online account. Information and documents can be shared by email, fax or text message based on the customer settings to family members, caregivers or other medical providers.

CarePanda will provide a comprehensive healthcare information management (HIM), service to customer. By designing and developing our service to be a low-cost, easy-to-use application that is delivered through a standard Web browser, we substantially reduce many of the traditional processes and complexities of managing your healthcare information.

Our service will help customers more effectively manage their healthcare information. We intend to market our service on a subscription basis, primarily through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners.

The pervasiveness of the Internet, along with the increase in adoption of smart phones and tablet devices will make it easier for users to track and manage information. TeleHealthCare

Cloud application services enable businesses to subscribe to a wide variety of application services that are developed specifically for, and delivered over, the Internet on an as-needed basis with little or no implementation services required and without the need to install software.

Existing Problem for Business – Regulations

As part the new HITECH Act and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (“ARRA”), healthcare providers are incentivized to implement electronic health records and to meet “Meaningful Use Guidelines” (“MUGs”). It is not mandatory that the healthcare providers meet these requirements but penalties will begin in 2015.

Under these guidelines, CarePanda helps healthcare providers meet the following MUGs:

Patient Discharge Meaningful Use Guideline (“MUG”)

Healthcare provide must provide information to patient including “compliance issues, dietary advice, follow-up monitoring, and information about the potential for adverse drug reactions & interactions including when and when not to call a doctor”
Patient Rights MUG

Healthcare providers must “Provide patients and families with timely access to data, knowledge, and tools to make informed decisions and to manage their health”

Transition Requirements MUG

Healthcare providers must provide electronic health information “During transition of patient care…” and make sure that information is communicated to family or other care taker.

HIPAA - Privacy & Security Compliance

HIPAA or Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is existing legislation that requires healthcare providers to keep healthcare information confidential. Several large institutions have been fined significantly for not protecting the healthcare privacy of their patients.
Our Solution

CaraPanda will put you in control of your healthcare information and bridges the gap between healthcare providers and family members. CarePanda works like a smart dashboard and can easily collect information and automatically alert you, family members or caregivers about specific healthcare changes or issues. CarePanda helps you manage the care of others even when you're not there.

For example, in a situation where an individual is discharged from a hospital and transported to an assisted living facility. CarePanda provides the tools that allow the individual and other family members to receive an update from the time the individual is discharged from the hospital to each time a caregiver visits the individual in the assisted living facility. CarePanda also has the ability for individuals and other family members to update or add notes to the individual’s account from their mobile phone or iPAD as well as maintain a list of the individual’s personal belongings and online files of her medical directives.

Managing care can be a daunting task including prescriptions, medical bills, caregiver schedules, lab results, physician office visits, medical equipment, insurance, Medicare and more! CarePanda allows clients to manage and monitor care regardless of where they are or what they are doing that day. By using CarePanda, families free up valuable time, can make more informed healthcare decisions and can be reassured that someone is able to manage care even on the days they are not available. It also allows customers to receive email alerts or even give permissions to caregivers or staff at the assisted living center to update status, send mobile pictures or fax bills directly into their CarePanda account.

CarePanda is also a critical tool for hospitals, nursing homes and other healthcare facilities to help them document and comply with an increasing array of regulations. Representatives from these facilities have been involved in the development of the CarePanda platform and view a co-branded or private label version of CarePanda as a key tool in meeting compliance requirements. Facilities would use CarePanda to improve the patient discharge process and extend their brand into the community.

BUSINESS MODEL & MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

CarePanda has a large target market focused on three (3) major revenue opportunities.


1) | B2C - Business to Consumer Model.
---+----------------------------------


Consumer model allows families to sign up for free and purchase monthly add-on services. Target markets are caregivers, snowbirds, court appointed care and families with loved ones having a chronic condition.


2) | B2B - Business to Business Model.
---+----------------------------------


CarePanda will license and create recurring revenue by co-branding with hospitals, medical groups, assisted living centers, skilled nursing facilities and other medical providers. There is significant awareness and concern among providers of how they are going to solve regulatory changes. Hospitals alone estimate regulatory changes will cost between $50 million to $100 million dollars for each facility. CarePanda solves this problem by creating a cost effective tool that will be utilized by staff at the point of patient discharge. There are approximately 6,000 hospitals, 34.9 million hospital discharges per year, 102 million outpatient visits per year, over 1 million residents in 33,000 assisted living centers and over 1.8 million skilled nursing rooms in the United States.


3) | OEM - Private Label Licensing Model.
---+-------------------------------------


Initial focus is on the B2C and B2B models. In the future CarePanda will license and provide private label solution for companies who want to create a new revenue model based on their brand and extension of their existing services. Examples include home healthcare providers, retail, medical device companies, insurance companies, self insured employers, TPAs, tele-healthcare providers, schools, universities, non-government organizations (NGOs) such as the YMCA and electronic health record (EHR) companies. CarePanda has already been approached by one of the nation’s largest hearing aid manufacturers to private label a tool for their audiology clinics.

CarePanda will address the market at the point of care through industry relationships and regulatory pressures being put on hospitals and nursing homes. Market share will be driven by several factors:


· | Being first to market
--+----------------------


· | Leveraging key industry contacts
--+---------------------------------


· | Accessibility of CarePanda on multiple platforms
--+-------------------------------------------------
