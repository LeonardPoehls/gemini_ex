ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

Physicians Realty Trust (the “Trust”), a Maryland real estate investment trust, and Physicians Realty L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership, were organized in April 2013 to acquire, selectively develop, own and manage healthcare properties that are leased to physicians, hospitals and healthcare delivery systems. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company,” the “Company,” and “Physicians Realty” refer to the Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, and the Ziegler Funds, and references to the “Operating Partnership” mean collectively the Operating Partnership together with its consolidated subsidiaries. We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in July 2013. The Trust’s common shares are listed on the NYSE and it is included in the MSCI US REIT Index.
We have grown our portfolio of gross real estate investments from approximately $124 million at the time of our IPO to approximately $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio consisted of 246 properties located in 29 states with approximately 10,883,601 net leasable square feet, which were approximately 96.1% leased with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 8.5 years and approximately 78.4% of the net leasable square footage of our portfolio was either affiliated with a healthcare delivery system or located within approximately 1/4 mile of a hospital campus.
We receive a cash rental stream from healthcare providers under our leases. Approximately 87.5% of the annualized base rent payments from our properties as of December 31, 2016 are from triple net leases, pursuant to which the tenants are responsible for all operating expenses relating to the property, including but not limited to real estate taxes, utilities, property insurance, routine maintenance and repairs, and property management. This structure helps insulate us from increases in certain operating expenses and provides relatively predictable cash flow. We seek to structure our triple net leases to generate attractive returns on a long-term basis. Our leases typically have initial terms of five to 15 years and include annual rent escalators of approximately 1.5% to 3.0%. Our operating results depend significantly upon the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments. We believe that our portfolio of medical office buildings and other healthcare facilities will enable us to generate stable cash flows over time because of the diversity of our tenants, staggered lease expiration schedule, long-term leases, and low historical occurrence of tenants defaulting under their leases. As of December 31, 2016, leases representing a percentage of our portfolio on the basis of leasable square feet will expire as follows: 

Year (1) | Portfolio Lease Expirations
MTM (2) | 0.8% 
2017 | 3.7% 
2018 | 4.5% 
2019 | 4.5% 
2020 | 3.8% 
2021 | 5.1% 
2022 | 3.9% 
2023 | 4.4% 
2024 | 7.2% 
2025 | 7.8% 
2026 | 27.7% 
Thereafter | 22.7% 
Total | 96.1% 


(1) | “MTM” means month-to-month.


(2) | Includes 3 leases which expired on December 31, 2016, representing 0.1% of portfolio leasable square feet.

We invest in real estate that is integral to providing high quality healthcare services. Our properties are typically located on a campus with a hospital or other healthcare facilities or strategically located and affiliated with a hospital or other healthcare system. We believe the impact of government programs and continuing trends in the healthcare industry create attractive opportunities for us to invest in healthcare-related real estate. Our management team has significant public healthcare REIT experience and has long established relationships with physicians, hospitals and healthcare delivery system decision makers that we believe will provide quality investment and growth opportunities. Our principal investments include medical 
4

office buildings, outpatient treatment facilities, and other real estate integral to health care providers. We seek to invest in stabilized medical facility assets with initial cash yields of 6.0% to 9.0%. 
We had no business operations prior to completion of the IPO and the related formation transactions on July 24, 2013. Our Predecessor, which is not a legal entity, is comprised of the four healthcare real estate private equity funds, organized as limited liability companies under the laws of Delaware, managed by B.C. Ziegler & Company, which we refer to as the Ziegler Funds, that owned directly or indirectly interests in entities that owned our initial properties we acquired on July 24, 2013 in connection with completion of our IPO and related formation transactions.

The Trust is a Maryland real estate investment trust and has elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We conduct our business through an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which our properties are owned by the Operating Partnership directly or through limited partnerships, limited liability companies or other subsidiaries. The Trust is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and, as of February 17, 2017, owned approximately 97.7% of the partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (“OP Units”). 
Our Objectives and Growth Strategy
Overview

Our principal business objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders through a combination of (i) sustainable and increasing rental revenue and cash flow that generate reliable, increasing dividends, and (ii) potential long-term appreciation in the value of our properties and common shares. Our primary strategies to achieve our business objective are to leverage our physician and hospital relationships nationwide to invest in off-market assets that maximize risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders, to invest in, own and manage a diversified portfolio of high quality healthcare properties, and to pay careful attention to our tenants’ real estate strategies, which we believe will drive high retention, high occupancy and reliable, increasing rental revenue and cash flow.

We intend to grow our portfolio of high-quality healthcare properties leased to physicians, hospitals, healthcare delivery systems and other healthcare providers primarily through acquisitions of existing healthcare facilities that provide stable revenue growth and predictable long-term cash flows. We may also selectively finance the development of new healthcare facilities through joint venture or fee arrangements with premier healthcare real estate developers. Generally, we only expect to make investments in new development properties when approximately 70% or more of the development property has been pre-leased before construction commences. We seek to invest in properties where we can develop strategic alliances with financially sound healthcare providers and healthcare delivery systems that offer need-based healthcare services in sustainable healthcare markets. We focus our investment activity on the following types of healthcare properties:

• | medical office buildings;


• | outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities;


• | physician group practice clinics;


• | ambulatory surgery centers; and


• | specialty hospitals and treatment centers.


We believe that shifting consumer preferences, limited space in hospitals, the desire of patients and healthcare providers to limit non-essential services provided in a hospital setting, and cost considerations, among other trends, continue to drive the industry trend of performing procedures in outpatient facilities that have traditionally been performed in hospitals, such as surgeries and other invasive medical procedures. As these trends continue, we believe that demand for medical office buildings and similar healthcare properties will continue to rise, and that our investment strategy accounts for these trends.
We may invest opportunistically in life science facilities, assisted living, and independent senior living facilities and in the longer term, senior housing properties, including skilled nursing. Consistent with the Trust’s qualification as a REIT, we may also opportunistically invest in companies that provide healthcare services, and in joint venture entities with operating partners structured to comply with the REIT Investment Diversification Act of 2007 (“RIDEA”).

In connection with our review and consideration of healthcare real estate investment opportunities, we generally take into account a variety of market considerations, including:

• | whether the property is anchored by a financially-sound healthcare delivery system or whether tenants have strong affiliation to a healthcare delivery system;


• | the performance of the local healthcare delivery system and its future prospects;

5


• | property location, with a particular emphasis on proximity to healthcare delivery systems;


• | demand for medical office buildings and healthcare related facilities, current and future supply of competing properties, and occupancy and rental rates in the market;


• | population density and growth potential;


• | ability to achieve economies of scale with our existing medical office buildings and healthcare related facilities or anticipated investment opportunities; and


• | existing and potential competition from other healthcare real estate owners and operators.

In addition, our management team has maintained a conservative balance sheet while investing over $2.8 billion in real estate assets since our IPO in July 2013. We selectively utilize capital market transactions, including raising over $750 million of equity through two follow-on offerings in 2016, in furtherance of our investment strategy.
Business Strategy
We are focused on building and maintaining a portfolio of high-quality healthcare properties leased to physicians, hospitals, healthcare delivery systems and other healthcare providers. Our investment strategy includes a focus on investments with the following key attributes:

• | We seek to invest in properties serving healthcare systems with dominant market share, high credit quality and those who are investing capital into their campuses. In particular, we seek to own off-market or selectively marketed assets with attractive demographics, economic growth, and high barriers to entry. We seek to invest in and maintain well occupied properties that we believe are critical to the delivery of healthcare.


• | We emphasize ensuring an appropriate and balanced mix of tenants to provide synergies within both individual buildings and the broader health system campus. Our primary tenants are healthcare systems, academic medical centers and leading physician groups. These groups typically have strong and stable financial performance. We believe this helps ensure stability in our rental income and tenant retention over time.


• | We seek to maintain a core, critical portfolio of properties and to build our reputation as a dedicated leading MOB owner and operator.


• | We seek to maintain or increase our average rental rates, and focus on actively leasing our vacant space and reducing leasing concessions.

In addition, we seek to invest in properties where we can develop strategic alliances with financially sound healthcare providers and healthcare delivery systems that offer need-based healthcare services in sustainable healthcare markets. We consider long-term relationship building when assessing acquisition potential. These relationships are cultivated by our senior management team, with key industry participants, including health systems and local and regional developers, which have traditionally provided us with valuable sources of potential investment opportunities.
Finally, we actively manage our balance sheet to maintain our investment grade credit rating, to maintain an appropriate level of leverage and to preserve financing flexibility for funding of future acquisitions. In particular, we:

• | Continue to maintain a high level of liquidity, including borrowing availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility.


• | Maintain access to multiple sources of capital, including private debt issuances and public equity offerings, unsecured bank loans and secured property level debt.


• | Closely monitor our existing debt maturities and average interest rates.

2016 Highlights and Other Recent Developments
Investments and Dispositions

• | For the full year 2016, we completed acquisitions of 95 operating healthcare properties (including 5 condominium units and the CHI Portfolio) and 1 land parcel, located in 23 states for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.27 billion. In addition, we funded $14.2 million of other investments, including the issuance of loans, the acquisition of an equity interest in a joint venture, and buyouts of noncontrolling interests, resulting in total investments of $1.29 billion.


• | During 2016, we entered into separate agreements to purchase 52 medical office facilities (which we now treat as 53 medical office facilities because we consider a certain condominium property as being separate from a nearby surgical center property) from regional health systems controlled by Catholic Health Initiatives (“CHI”) containing 3,159,495 rentable square feet located in 10 states (the “CHI Portfolio”). To date, we have completed the acquisition of 49 of the properties in the CHI Portfolio representing 3,016,926 net leasable square feet. We elected not to complete the acquisition of 2 of the CHI Portfolio properties. We still have one property under one of the original agreements to purchase a medical office facility in Fruitland, Idaho for $4.8 million, and we entered into a separate agreement to purchase a newly constructed medical office facility in Omaha, Nebraska for approximately $33.4 million that is 100% leased and will be 100% occupied by CHI’s affiliate, Creighton University Medical Center, upon its completion of certain tenant improvements. We anticipate closing on the Omaha, Nebraska medical office facility during the first quarter of 2017 and on the Fruitland, Idaho medical office facility later in 2017.


• | Since January 1, 2017, we have completed acquisitions of 4 healthcare properties for an aggregate purchase price of $109.5 million containing an aggregate of 238,312 net leasable square feet.


• | The Company has determined that certain past and future rental payments and prepaid expenses from 4 assets affiliated with Foundation Healthcare, Inc. (OTC: FDNH) (“Foundation Healthcare”), may be uncollectible at this time and has reserved approximately $3.7 million against previously recognized rental revenue, prepaid expenses, and deferred rent. $1.1 million of this charge is attributable to a lease default by Foundation Healthcare’s wholly-owned subsidiary that rented a medical office facility from us in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. We have entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell this medical office building for $15.3 million which would generate a net gain of $1.6 million. The closing of the sale of this property is subject to customary closing conditions, and no assurance can be made that we will complete the sale of this property or as to the timing or terms of any such sale.

Approximately $2.6 million of this charge is attributable to obligations under 3 separate leases for 2 surgical hospitals and a medical office building leased to Foundation Healthcare-physician joint ventures in San Antonio and El Paso, Texas. The Company is actively working with Foundation Healthcare and the physician co-owners in each separate surgical hospital involved to transfer Foundation Healthcare’s interest in each joint venture, shift management away from Foundation Healthcare, and collect past due rent and expenses. Each location is attracting significant interest from surgical hospital management and ownership companies. The Company cannot make any assurance that all or any of the past due rent or prepaid expenses will be collected or that the transfer of joint venture ownership interests from FDNH to a new surgical hospital management company will occur.
Both the Foundation Surgical Hospital of San Antonio and the Foundation Surgical Hospital of El Paso have operated continuously throughout this process and we do not anticipate any disruption in service by either surgical hospital. These three assets and an additional medical office building leased to the Foundation Healthcare-physician joint venture in San Antonio have been slated for disposition.
Separately, the Company has entered into definitive purchase agreements to sell four medical office buildings in Georgia from our legacy portfolio, which consist of 80,292 square feet in the aggregate for a purchase price of $18.2 million, which would generate a net gain of $4.0 million. 
In total, the 9 assets slated for disposition contain 319,085 square feet of gross leasable area, and the Company currently estimates that these properties will be sold for approximately $100 million to $125 million in the aggregate. No assurance can be made, however, that any or all of the properties will be sold, that the Company will receive the anticipated consideration for the sale of any or all of the properties, or as to the timing of any such sale or sales.

Capital and Dividends

• | On January 7, 2016, we issued and sold $150 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes. The proceeds of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate and working capital purposes and funding acquisitions.


• | On January 25, 2016, we completed a follow-on public offering of 21,275,000 common shares of beneficial interest, including 2,775,000 common shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $321.1 million. The Trust contributed the net proceeds of this offering to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 21,275,000 OP Units, and we used the net proceeds of the public offering to repay borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate and working capital purposes and funding acquisitions.


• | On April 11, 2016, we completed a follow-on public offering of 25,875,000 common shares of beneficial interest, including 3,375,000 common shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $442.6 million. The Trust contributed the net proceeds of this offering to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 25,875,000 OP Units, and we used the net proceeds of the public offering to repay borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, for general corporate and working capital purposes, for funding acquisitions, and to fund a portion of the purchase price for the CHI Acquisition.


• | On June 10, 2016, we amended our existing credit facility, increasing the maximum principal amount available under our unsecured revolving credit facility from $750 million to $850 million, and adding a term loan feature with a $250 million maximum borrowing amount. The amended credit facility includes a swingline loan commitment for up to 10% of the maximum principal amount and provides an accordion feature allowing us to increase borrowing capacity by up to an additional $500 million, subject to customary terms and conditions, resulting in a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.6 billion.


• | On August 5, 2016, we entered into separate At Market Issuance Sales Agreements with each of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., JMP Securities LLC, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. and Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, our common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $300 million.


• | On August 11, 2016, we issued and sold $75 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes. The proceeds of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate and working capital purposes and funding acquisitions.

Our Industry and Market Opportunity
The nature of healthcare delivery continues to evolve due to the impact of government programs, regulatory changes and consumer preferences. We believe these changes have increased the need for capital among healthcare providers and increased pressure on these providers to integrate more efficient real estate solutions in order enhance the delivery of quality healthcare. In particular, we believe the following factors and trends are creating an attractive environment in which to invest in healthcare properties.
$3.2 Trillion Healthcare Industry Projected to Grow to $5.5 Trillion (and 20.1% of U.S. GDP) by 2025
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), healthcare spending accounted for 17.8% of U.S. gross domestic product (“GDP”) in 2015. The general aging of the population, driven by the Baby Boomer generation and advances in medical technology and services which increase life expectancy, are key drivers of the growth in healthcare expenditures. The anticipated continuing increase in demand for healthcare services, together with an evolving complex and costly regulatory environment, changes in medical technology and reductions in government reimbursements are expected to pressure capital-constrained healthcare providers to find cost effective solutions for their real estate needs.
8

We believe the demand by healthcare providers for healthcare real estate will increase as healthcare spending in the United States continues to increase. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ National Health Expenditure Projections 2016-2025, national healthcare expenditures continue to rise and are projected to grow from an estimated $3.5 trillion in 2016 to $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing an average annual rate of growth of 5.8%, reaching a projected 19.9% of GDP in 2025.

Aging Population
The aging of the U.S. population has a direct effect on the demand for healthcare as older persons generally utilize healthcare services at a rate well in excess of younger people. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. population over 65 years of age is projected to more than double from 47.8 million to nearly 98.2 million and the 85 and older population is expected to more than triple, from 6.3 million to 19.7 million, between 2015 and 2060. Also according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of older Americans is growing as a percentage of the total U.S. population with the number of persons older than 65 estimated to comprise 14.9% of the total U.S. population in 2015 and projected to grow to 23.6% by 2060.
We believe that healthcare expenditures for the population over 65 years of age will continue to rise as a disproportionate share of healthcare dollars is spent on older Americans. To illustrate, in 2012 the elderly (65+ years old) represented only 14% of the population while accounting for 34% of all healthcare-related spending. We believe the older population group increasingly will require treatment and management of chronic and acute health ailments and that this increased demand for healthcare services will create a substantial need for additional medical office buildings and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry in many regions of the United States. Additionally, we believe there will likely be a focus on lowering the cost of outpatient care to support the aging U.S. population, which will continue to support medical office and outpatient facility property demand in the long term. We believe these trends will result in a substantial increase in the number of properties meeting our investment criteria.
9

We believe advances in medical technology will continue to enable healthcare providers to identify and treat once fatal illnesses and improve the survival rate of critically ill and injured patients who will require continuing medical care. Along with these technical innovations, the U.S. population is growing older and living longer.

Affordable Care Act 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Affordable Care Act”) constitutes a significant overhaul of many aspects of healthcare regulations and health insurance. We believe this evolution of U.S. healthcare policy creates the framework for healthcare services over the near term. The Affordable Care Act requires every American to have health insurance or be subjected to a tax. Those who cannot afford health insurance are offered insurance subsidies or Medicaid coverage. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that approximately 50 million Americans did not have healthcare insurance in 2009. HHS predicts the Affordable Care Act will result in an additional 30 million Americans having healthcare insurance by 2020, which we believe will substantially increase the demand for healthcare services.
We believe the increase in the number of Americans with access to health insurance will result in an increase in physician office visits and an overall rise in healthcare utilization which in turn will drive a need for expansion of medical, outpatient, and smaller specialty hospital facilities. Additionally, the increased dissemination of health research through media outlets, marketing of healthcare products, and availability of advanced screening techniques and medical procedures have contributed to a more engaged population of healthcare users. We believe this has created increased demand for customized facilities providing specialized, preventive and integrative healthcare services.
The Affordable Care Act further contains provisions which are designed to lower certain reimbursement amounts under Medicare and tie reimbursement levels to the quality of services provided. We believe these and other provisions of the Affordable Care Act will increase the pressure on healthcare providers to become more efficient in their business models, invest capital in their businesses, lower costs and improve the quality of care, which in turn will drive healthcare systems to monetize their real estate assets and create demand for new, modern and specialized facilities.
We note, however, that President Trump and leadership in Congress have publicly stated their intention to repeal and replace (or modify) the Affordable Care Act. On January 20, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order stating that it is the administration’s official policy to repeal the Affordable Care Act and instructing the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies with authority and responsibility under the Affordable Care Act to, among other matters, delay implementation of or grant an exemption from any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any state or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, and others. We cannot predict the effect of this Executive Order on the Affordable Care Act, or whether the attempt to repeal and replace (or modify) the law will be successful. 
Further we cannot predict how the Affordable Care Act might be amended or modified, either through the legislative or judicial process, and how any such modification might impact our tenants’ operations or the net effect of this law on us. If the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by any repeal or modification of the law, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well.

Clinical Care Continues to Shift to Outpatient Care
According to the American Hospital Association, procedures traditionally performed in hospitals, such as certain types of surgery, are increasingly moving to outpatient facilities driven by advances in clinical science, shifting consumer preferences, limited or inefficient space in existing hospitals and lower costs in the outpatient environment. This continuing shift toward delivering healthcare services in an outpatient environment rather than a traditional hospital environment increases the need for additional outpatient facilities and smaller, more specialized and efficient hospitals. Studies by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and others have shown that healthcare is delivered more cost effectively and with higher patient satisfaction when it is provided on an outpatient basis. Increasingly, hospital admissions are reserved for the critically ill, and less critical patients are treated on an outpatient basis with recuperation in their own homes. We believe healthcare market trends toward outpatient care will continue to push healthcare services out of larger, older, inefficient hospitals and into newer, more efficient and conveniently located outpatient facilities and smaller specialized hospitals. We believe that increased specialization within the medical field is also driving demand for medical facilities designed specifically for particular specialties and that physicians want to locate their practices in medical office space that is in or adjacent to these facilities.
Impact of BBA on Outpatient Care 
Section 603 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the “BBA”) will exclude certain hospital outpatient departments (“HOPDs”) from charging hospital inpatient rates, potentially impacting their profitability. Until recently, some HOPDs charged similar rates as hospital inpatient departments for certain services. The BBA was passed into law on November 2, 2015, and is effective as of January 1, 2017. All HOPDs currently reimbursed at the existing hospital inpatient rates will be allowed to continue reimbursement at these higher rates, and thus Section 603 of the BBA will apply only to new HOPD locations.
We own a number of assets that will continue to be reimbursed at hospital inpatient rates, which we refer to as “603 assets” after the applicable section of the BBA. Rent derived from these 603 assets accounts for approximately 23.9% of our total portfolio annualized base rent as of December 31, 2016. Depending upon the implementation of the regulations, the BBA may enhance the value of these 603 assets because existing HOPDs may lose their higher reimbursements rates should they choose to change locations.
Portfolio Summary

Please see “Item 2. Properties” for a table that summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2016.

Geographic Concentration

For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 12.1% of our total annualized base rent was derived from properties located in Texas. 
As a result of this geographic concentration, we are particularly exposed to downturns in the Texas economy or other changes in local real estate market conditions. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental, or competitive conditions in Texas could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results. In the event of negative economic or other changes in the Texas market, our business, financial condition, and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and the trading price of our common shares may be adversely affected. See the discussion under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” under the caption, “Economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas in which we conduct business, and in particular areas to which a greater percentage of our revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”
11

Customer Concentration

We receive substantially all of our revenue as rent payments from tenants under leases of space in our healthcare properties, with our five largest tenants based upon rental revenue representing approximately $37.9 million, or 17.3%, of the annualized base rent from our properties as of December 31, 2016. No one tenant represents more than 5.8% of our total annualized base rent; however, 17.4% of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2016 is from tenants affiliated with CHI. We have no control over the success or failure of our tenants’ businesses and, at any time, any of our tenants may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition. Our business, financial position or results of operation could be materially adversely affected if CHI were to experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial position or results of operations. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” under the caption “If CHI’s business, financial position or results of operations suffer or are adversely affected, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.” 
Competition

We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of healthcare properties, including national, regional and local operators, acquirers and developers of healthcare-related real estate properties and other investors such as private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. The competition for healthcare-related real estate properties may significantly increase the price that we must pay for healthcare properties or other assets that we seek to acquire, and our competitors may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves. In addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more for the properties or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. In particular, larger REITs that target healthcare properties may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital, enhanced operating efficiencies, more personnel, and market penetration and familiarity with markets. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase. Increased competition would result in increased demand for the same assets and therefore increase prices paid for them. Those higher prices for healthcare properties or other assets may adversely affect our returns from our investments.
We also face competition in leasing available MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry to prospective tenants. As a result, we may have to provide rent concessions, incur charges for tenant improvements, offer other inducements, or we may be unable to timely lease vacant space in our properties, all of which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
Credit Facility and Debt
On June 10, 2016, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, and the Trust entered into an amended and restated Credit Agreement with KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., BMO Capital Markets, and Citizens Bank N.A., as joint lead arrangers and co-book runners, BMO Capital Markets and Citizens Bank N.A., as co-syndication agents, and the lenders party thereto (the “Credit Agreement”) which increased the maximum principal amount available under an unsecured revolving credit facility from $750 million to $850 million. The Credit Agreement contains a 7-year term loan feature allowing us to borrow in a single drawing up to $250 million, increasing the borrowing capacity to an aggregate $1.1 billion. The Credit Agreement also includes a swingline loan commitment for up to 10% of the maximum principal amount and provides an accordion feature allowing us to increase borrowing capacity by up to an additional $500 million, subject to customary terms and conditions, resulting in a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.6 billion.
On July 7, 2016, the Operating Partnership borrowed $250.0 million under the 7-year term loan feature of the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the term loan feature of the Credit Agreement bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate which is determined by the Trust’s credit rating, currently equal to LIBOR + 1.80%. The Trust simultaneously entered into a pay-fixed receive-variable rate swap for the full borrowing amount, fixing the LIBOR component of the borrowing rate to 1.07%, for an all-in fixed rate of 2.87%. Both the borrowing and pay-fixed receive-variable swap have a maturity date of June 10, 2023.
The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of September 18, 2020 and includes a one year extension option. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at an adjusted LIBOR rate, which is based on the Trust’s investment grade rating under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, the Trust had an investment grade rating from Moody’s of Baa3 and as such, borrowings under the revolving credit facility of the Credit Agreement accrued interest on the outstanding principal at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.20%. The Credit Agreement includes a facility fee equal to 0.25% per annum, which is also determined by the Trust’s investment grade rating.
12

The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that, among other things, require compliance with leverage and coverage ratios and maintenance of minimum tangible net worth, as well as covenants that may limit our ability to incur additional debt or make distributions. We may, at any time, voluntarily prepay any revolving or swingline loan under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part without premium or penalty. Prepayments of term borrowings require payment of premiums of up to 2.0% of the amount of prepayment, dependent on the date of such prepayment. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants.
The Credit Agreement includes customary representations and warranties by the Trust and the Operating Partnership and imposes customary covenants on the Trust and the Operating Partnership. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, and if an event of default occurs and continues, the Operating Partnership is subject to certain actions by the administrative agent, including without limitation, the acceleration of repayment of all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

The Credit Agreement provides for revolving credit and term loans to the Operating Partnership. Base Rate Loans, Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loans, and Letters of Credit (each, as defined in the Credit Agreement) will be subject to interest rates, based upon the Trust’s investment grade rating as follows:

Environmental Matters

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties as a result of environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties even if we no longer own such properties. See the discussion under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” under the caption “Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with owning, leasing, developing and operating our properties may affect our results of operations.”
 Certain Government Regulations
Overview

Our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse practices, government reimbursement, licensure and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities, and we expect that the healthcare industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, healthcare management and provision of services, among others. These regulations are wide-ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. Affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another. Changes in laws and regulations, reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” under the caption “The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and new laws or regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could adversely impact our company and result in the inability of our tenants to make rent payments to us.”

The following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators, and in certain cases, to us.

Healthcare Legislation
Health Reform Laws.  On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “Affordable Care Act”) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which amends the Affordable Care Act (collectively with other subsequently enacted federal health care laws and regulations, the “Health Reform Laws”). The Health Reform Laws contain various provisions that may directly impact us or the operators and tenants of our properties.  Some provisions of the Health Reform Laws may have a positive impact on our operators’ or tenants’ revenues, by, for example, increasing coverage of uninsured individuals, while others may have a negative impact on the reimbursement of our operators or tenants by, for example, altering the market basket adjustments for certain types of health care facilities.  The Health Reform Laws also enhance certain fraud and abuse penalty provisions that could apply to our operators and tenants, in the event of one or more violations of the federal health care regulatory laws. In addition, there are provisions that impact the health coverage that we and our operators and tenants provide to our respective employees.  The Health Reform Laws also provide additional Medicaid funding to allow states to carry out the expansion of Medicaid coverage to certain financially-eligible individuals beginning in 2014, and have also permitted states to expand their Medicaid coverage to these individuals since April 1, 2010, if certain conditions are met.  On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate of the Health Reform Laws but partially invalidated the expansion of Medicaid.  The ruling on Medicaid expansion will allow states not to participate in the expansion—and to forego funding for the Medicaid expansion—without losing their existing Medicaid funding.  Given that the federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option.  The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, through new patients, but could also further strain state budgets.  While the federal government paid for approximately 100% of those additional costs from 2014 to 2016, states now are expected to pay for part of those additional costs. 
Challenges to the Health Reform Laws and Potential Repeal and/or Further Reforms under Trump Administration.  Since the enactment of the Health Care Laws, there have been multiple attempts through legislative action and legal challenge to repeal or amend the Health Reform Laws, including the case that was before the U.S. Supreme Court, King v. Burwell.  Although the Supreme Court in Burwell upheld the use of subsidies to individuals in federally-facilitated health care exchanges on June 25, 2015, which ultimately did not disrupt significantly the implementation of the Health Reform Laws, we cannot predict whether other current or future efforts to repeal, amend or challenge the validity of all or part of the Health Reform 
14

Laws will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a repeal, amendment or challenge would have on our operators or tenants and their ability to meet their obligations to us.
President Trump and leadership in Congress have publicly stated their intention to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. On January 20, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order stating that it is the administration’s official policy to repeal the Affordable Care Act and instructing the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies with authority and responsibility under the Affordable Care Act to, among other matters, delay implementation of or grant an exemption from any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any state or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, and others. We cannot predict the effect of this Executive Order on the Affordable Care Act, or whether any of these attempts to amend, modify, or repeal and replace the law will be successful. 
We cannot predict how the Affordable Care Act might be amended or modified, either through the legislative or judicial process, and how any such modification might impact our tenants’ operations or the net effect of this law on us. If the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by any repeal or modification of the law, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well.
Fraud and Abuse Enforcement

There are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers’ relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers. These laws include (i) federal and state false claims acts, which, among other things, prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs, (ii) federal and state anti-kickback and fee-splitting statutes, including the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services, (iii) federal and state physician self-referral laws (commonly referred to as the “Stark Law”), which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship, (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and (v) federal and state privacy laws, including the privacy and security rules contained in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information. Violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, including punitive sanctions, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs. These laws are enforced by a variety of federal, state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions. Many of our operators and tenants are subject to these laws, and some of them may in the future become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws.
Reimbursement

Sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include, among other sources, governmental healthcare programs, such as the federal Medicare program and state and Medicaid program, and non-governmental payors, such as insurance carriers and HMOs. As federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives, and as the federal government and many states face significant budget deficits, efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators.
We cannot predict whether future Congressional proposals will seek to reduce physician reimbursements. Efforts by other payors to reduce healthcare costs are likely to continue, which may result in reductions or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants. Further, revenue realizable under third-party payor agreements can change after examination and retroactive adjustment by payors during the claims settlement process or as a result of post-payment audits. For example, payors may disallow requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable, because additional documentation is necessary or because certain services were not covered or were not medically necessary. The Healthcare Reform Laws and regulatory changes could impose further limitations on government and private payments to healthcare providers. In some cases, states have enacted or are considering enacting measures designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance. In addition, the failure of any of our tenants to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their ability to continue participating in Medicare, Medicaid and other government sponsored payment programs. The financial impact on our tenants’ failure to comply with such laws and regulations could restrict their ability to make rent payments to us.

Healthcare Licensure and Certificate of Need

Certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws and regulations. In addition, various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies and laboratories, handle radioactive materials and operate equipment. Many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need, which requires prior approval for the construction, expansion and closure of certain healthcare facilities. The approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants’ and operators’ abilities to expand or change their businesses.
