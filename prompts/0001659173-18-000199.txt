Rizzen Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in Nevada on October 21, 2015. Our principal executive offices are located at Room 402, Unit B, Building 5,Guanghua Community, Guanghua Road, Tianning District, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China. Our phone number is 0519-89801180.


We have no active operations. Our prior business model was to provide vending and shipping services of electronic toys of various kinds manufactured in the Republic of China and to distribute electronic kids toys of various price categories to both small and medium-sized vendors. We intended on selling, importing, and marketing our business to European and North American markets.
 
The Company is seeking to acquire, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses or assets that we have not yet identified.
 
At present, we have no employees. Our officers and directors are listed below.

Business of Issuer
 
The Company, based on proposed business activities, is a "blank check" company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") defines those companies as "any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies." Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a "shell company," because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination.
 
The Company intends to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company's principal business is to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company's officer. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company has not entered into any agreement with any party regarding acquisition opportunities for the Company. The Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Company will consider the following kinds of factors:

● | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds from the Company, from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other relevant factors.
--+------------------------

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available acquisition opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Company's lack of capital to fund the investigation, the Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the business to be acquired. In addition, we will be competing against other entities that possess greater financial, technical and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing business combinations. In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible given the lack of information that may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources.
 
We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business's incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. Our lack of funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or other associated with the target business seeking our participation.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us.
 
Additionally, the Company is in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. We are, and will continue to be, an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination.

Form of Acquisition
 
The manner in which the Company participates in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters.
 
It is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of securities of the Company. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called "tax free" reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other "tax free" provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization.
 
The Company does not intend to supply disclosure to stockholders concerning a target company prior to the consummation of a business combination transaction, unless required by applicable law or regulation. The Company will file a current report on Form 8-K, as required, within four business days of a business combination which results in the Company ceasing to be a shell company. Such Form 8-K will include complete disclosure of the target company, including audited financial statements.
 
The present stockholders of the Company may not have control of a majority of the voting securities of the Company following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, all or a majority of the Company's directors may resign and one or more new directors may be appointed without any vote by the stockholders.
 
The Company intends to search for a business combination by contacting various sources including, but not limited to, our affiliates, lenders, investment banking firms, private equity funds, consultants and attorneys. The approximate number of persons or entities that will be contacted is unknown and dependent on whether any opportunities are presented by the sources that we contact. It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Company of the related costs incurred.
 
We presently have no employees. Our sole officer and director is engaged in outside business activities on a full-time basis. Our sole officer and director anticipates that she will devote very limited time to our business until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. The specific amount of time that management will devote to the Company may vary from week to week or even day to day, and therefore the specific amount of time that management will devote to the Company on a weekly basis cannot be ascertained with any level of certainty. In all cases, management intends to spend as much time as is necessary to exercise its fiduciary duties.
