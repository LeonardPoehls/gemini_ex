ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview

Shutterfly, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1999. In September 2006, we completed our initial public offering and our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “SFLY.” Our principal corporate offices are located in Redwood City, California.
We are the leading online manufacturer and retailer of high-quality personalized products and services. Our vision is to make the world a better place by helping people share life’s joy. Our mission is to build an unrivaled service that enables deeper, more personal relationships between our customers and those who matter most in their lives.  Our primary focus is on helping consumers manage their memories through the powerful medium of photography. We provide a full range of personalized photo-based products and services that make it easy, convenient and fun for consumers to upload, edit, enhance, organize, find, share, create, print, and preserve their memories in a creative and thoughtful manner.
Our high-quality products and services and the compelling online experience we create for our customers, combined with our focus on continuous innovation, have allowed us to establish premium brands. We realize the benefits of premium brands through high customer loyalty, low customer acquisition costs and premium pricing. Our trusted premium brands are:
Shutterfly leads the market in digital personalized photo products and services. Shutterfly helps our customers turn their precious memories into lasting keepsakes with award-winning photo books, personalized holiday cards, announcements, invitations and stationery, as well as custom home decor products and unique photo gifts. Our online photo service helps our customers stay connected with family and friends, empowering them to do more with their pictures by expressing themselves in extraordinary ways.
Tiny Prints is a leading premium online cards and stationery boutique, offering stylish announcements, invitations and personal stationery for every occasion. Tiny Prints has grown from a tiny self-funded company specializing in unique baby stationery to a leading online destination for stylish stationery, for every occasion. Customers (celebrities and top designers alike) seek us out for our fresh designs, premium paper and exceptional customer service. 
Wedding Paper Divas offers stylish and personalized save the dates, wedding invitations, thank you cards, bridal invitations and more-all designed by leading artists in the industry.
MyPublisher is where our customers can create custom photo books, share great memories and tell their stories using their own photos.
BorrowLenses is a premier online market place for high-quality photographic and video equipment rentals.
Groovebook is a mobile photo book app subscription service that sends customers a keepsake book of their mobile photos on a periodic basis.
We generate the majority of our revenues by producing and selling a variety of products such as greeting and stationery cards, professionally-bound photo books, personalized calendars, home décor, statement gifts, other photo-based merchandise and high-
4

quality prints. We manufacture most of these items in our Fort Mill, South Carolina; Shakopee, Minnesota; and Tempe, Arizona production facilities. By operating our own production facilities, we are able to produce high-quality products, innovate rapidly, maintain a favorable cost structure and ensure timely shipment to customers, even during peak periods of demand. Additionally, we sell a variety of products that are currently manufactured for us by third parties, such as calendars, mugs, ornaments, candles, pillows and blankets.   
We generate substantially all of our revenue from sales originating in the United States and our sales cycle has historically been highly seasonal as we generate approximately 50% of our total net revenues during our fiscal fourth quarter. Our operations and financial performance depend on general economic conditions in the United States, consumer sentiment, and the levels of consumer discretionary spending.  We closely monitor these economic measures as their trends are indicators of the health of the overall economy and are some of the key external factors that impact our business.
Our customers are a central part of our business model. They generate most of the content on our service by uploading their photos and storing their memories. In addition, they share their photos electronically with their friends and families, extending and endorsing our brand and creating a sense of community. Finally, by giving our branded products to colleagues, friends and loved ones throughout the year, customers reinforce our brands. Through these various activities, our customers create a network of new users and customers.
In addition to driving lower customer acquisition costs through multiple marketing channels, our customers provide input on new features, functionalities and products. Close, frequent customer interactions, coupled with significant investments in sophisticated integrated marketing programs, enable us to fine-tune and tailor our promotions and website presentation to specific customer segments. Consequently, customers are presented with a highly personalized shopping experience, which helps foster a unique and deep relationship with our brands.
In order to successfully execute our strategies, we require a talented leadership team. As a result, we intend to continue our focus to attract, retain, and grow our team; and to build continuity and pursue executional excellence in our daily operations everywhere. By providing our employees with a great place to work, we believe that we continue to strengthen our high performance culture. In December 2015, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer announced that they were leaving the Company on February 19, 2016. In May 2016, we hired Christopher North as our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. North joined us from Amazon UK where he most recently served as UK Managing Director of Amazon EU Sarl.
In February 2017, we announced a restructuring plan of our existing Consumer businesses. In 2017, we are recommitting to Tiny Prints as our premium cards & stationery brand by creating a Tiny Prints boutique on a dedicated tab on Shutterfly.com. We will roll out the new Shutterfly Wedding Store, which will be the focus of our future wedding strategy and will include a premium Wedding Paper Divas branded stationery collection. The existing Tiny Prints and Wedding Paper Divas sites will cease to operate. We are retiring the MyPublisher brand and site entirely. For all three of these brands, we will seek to retain as many customers and as much revenue as possible, migrating customers to Shutterfly.com: to the Tiny Prints boutique for Tiny Prints, to the Shutterfly Wedding store for Wedding Paper Divas, and to Shutterfly Photo Books for MyPublisher. Also as part of this restructuring, the Company will reduce headcount by approximately 13%. 
Segment Information
Our reportable segments are Consumer and Shutterfly Business Solutions ("SBS").

Business Initiatives
Consumer
In 2016, we launched a new Shutterfly mobile app on iOS and Android, providing our customers with an expanded product catalog, simplified product creation paths, and auto-upload functionality. The new apps now include the ability to create and purchase cards and stationery, our largest category by annual revenue. Both apps feature a new, intuitive, easy-to-use creation experience that allows customers to create a card. And, our iOS app adds a new photo book creation experience that allows customers to create photobooks. Both apps allow customers to automatically upload their photos and to easily create personalized products. Importantly, the new mobile apps have been built using our new service-oriented architecture. That means that the features and improvements we launch in the apps will be reusable elsewhere in Shutterfly. Groovebook continues our commitment to offering customers dynamic mobile experiences and options for preserving their memories. In 2016, the percentage of revenues coming from mobile sources for the Shutterfly brand increased to 18% from 13% in 2015 and 10% in 2014.
In 2016, we also integrated our prior ThisLife photo management service, referred to as Shutterfly Photos, into Shutterfly.com, and we reached our full-year goal of migrating our most active customers to this technology. We believe that our photo management service will deepen our relationships with customers by inspiring them to upload more photographs and by driving greater engagement, thereby creating more opportunities to present them with contextually relevant products. Shutterfly Photos customers now have the ability to view all of their photos on a timeline, organize them with albums, tags, places or favorites, identify and find people they care about in their pictures using our facial recognition technology, and easily create products from their favorite photos.
We launched new physical products in 2016, including new designs and form factors, new Home Décor products, and the new Statement Gifts line of premium personalized gifts. Our Home Décor and Gifting categories continued to gain traction with customers, growing double-digits year-over-year. 
To support our business strategies within the Consumer segment, we use a variety of integrated marketing programs, including strategic marketing partnerships, e-mail marketing to prospects and existing customers, search engine marketing, search engine optimization, affiliate marketing, display advertising, traditional direct marketing mailings such as postcards and seasonal catalogs, print advertising, regional radio advertising, and a national cable TV campaign during the holiday season. In addition, because many of our products are either shared over the Internet or given as gifts, the appearance of our brands on the products and packaging provides ongoing advertising. We place targeted advertisements on websites and in publications, contract for targeted e-mail marketing services and contract for advertising placement on leading search engines.
 Throughout 2016, we deployed dozens of highly integrated channel campaigns with a balance of direct response and brand awareness that enabled the company to reach new levels of brand awareness and engagement. Our philanthropic partnership with the Ellen DeGeneres show entered its fifth season in 2016 and we also launched new partnerships with other category leaders. Lastly, we continue to work closely with our key advertising partners to participate in new programs.
We manage our business activities with a focus on continued revenue and profitability growth. Our financial strategy involves growing revenues across our brands and initiatives in a way that generates continued adjusted EBITDA growth. We define adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation.
SBS
In 2016, SBS delivered strong performance through better scope and scale efficiencies, automation and more focused sales. We were successful in winning follow-on contracts from our existing key clients where our ability to execute on personalized print and digital communications at scale resulted in additional programs and volumes. We also successfully obtained new customers and continue to focus on obtaining additional new customers as well as deepening our existing relationships. 
We believe customers are coming to SBS because we provide value at a level much above a traditional printer. We are an integrated marketing partner and with the help of our large footprint of digital presses, we are building a scalable platform that 
6

enables our clients to optimize their integrated marketing campaigns. We believe our platform investments will further differentiate SBS and position us to capitalize on an important new market opportunity.
Strategy
The following principles are the foundation for our strategy going forward:
•Innovate on behalf of customers, delivering great experiences
•Focus on a small number of high-potential opportunities
•Optimize for the long-term
•Seek sustainable growth, balanced with profitability
With these principles firmly in mind, we plan to simplify our Consumer business in 2017 as the first step in our longer-term strategy. Our 2017 plan attempts to focus our resources on a small number of high-potential opportunities, reduce overhead costs, and move us towards a consolidated Consumer platform, with goals of delivering greater profitability and re-investing in the business for future growth.
Our vision is strongly motivated by the belief that sustainable growth comes from innovating on behalf of customers over the long term.  Hence, our strategy for the short to medium term has four components:

• | Make purchasing personalized products simple

Our goal is to improve and over time radically simplify every aspect of the creation and purchase process. We imagine a future in which customers are presented with beautiful, contextually relevant, personalized products, automatically created and ready to purchase with a single click, or to customize further. Our mobile app, Shutterfly Photos, and machine-learning-powered automated product creation are all enablers of that vision. At the same time as we work towards that long-term vision, we will seek to improve the customer experience we offer today to decrease friction, increase speed, and inspire our customers. 

• | Offer customers a broader range of products

Throughout Shutterfly’s history, category expansion and new product launches have been one of the most reliable drivers of growth. We envision a future where we offer the broadest possible selection of premium, personalized products. We expect to launch additional product types in the Home Décor and Personalized Gifts categories in 2017 and we also expect to explore launching additional new categories in 2018 and beyond.

• | Pivot towards mobile

Mobile is a core element of our growth strategy itself. App users can automatically upload all of their photos to Shutterfly Photos, enhancing our ability to present inspiring products to customers and supports the first two elements above. As we encourage our existing web customers to migrate to our app, they become more valuable to us. We expect to continue to acquire new customers to mobile whom we would not have acquired on the web. And over time, we expect to create mobile-first and mobile-only experiences as well.

• | Leverage our manufacturing platform

With SBS we’ve already demonstrated that we can leverage our existing capabilities to build an entirely new business to a new set of customers, providing variable and just-in-time printing needs and driving volume through our fixed-cost infrastructure. SBS historically has built dedicated systems to support each large customer and we intend to leverage this work to obtain additional SBS customers and also to expand our manufacturing platform beyond SBS. 
Technology and Production Systems
We use a combination of proprietary and third-party technology, including the following:
Customer relationship management or CRM system. Our integrated CRM system is composed of various tools designed to convert first-time customers into repeat buyers. We seek to increase average order sizes by expanding customer awareness, providing targeted, segmented offers to customers, and encouraging cross- and up-selling. The system uses a variety of data, including website usage patterns, order size, order frequency, products purchased, seasonality factors, image upload, and share usage, as 
7

well as customer satisfaction information. This data is continually updated and refreshed in a data warehouse, from which different customer segments are identified and monitored on a continuing basis for targeted marketing communications.
By using this deep customer intelligence and ongoing analysis, we are able to offer customers a more personalized website experience and to target them with specific website promotions, discounts, specialized e-mail, and direct mail offers. Our promotion engine generates special offers that are account specific and applied automatically at checkout.
We are also able to dynamically assign visitors to test and control groups who are shown different versions of our service. This form of A-B testing enables us to continuously optimize products, pricing, promotions, and user interaction with our websites.
Website system. We have designed our website systems to be secure and highly available within a data center, and not across geographically isolated data centers. We can scale to increasing numbers of customers cost-effectively by adding relatively inexpensive industry-standard computers and servers. We have a strong commitment to our privacy policy, and we utilize technologies such as firewalls, encryption technology for secure transmission of personal information between customers’ computers and our website system and intrusion detection systems.
Image archive. We store our customers’ images in our image archive. Once a customer uploads a photo to our website, it is copied to highly redundant systems. We continue to expand our storage capacity to meet increasing customer demand. Our innovative storage architecture provides low storage costs, facilitates the safe, secure archiving of customers’ images and delivers the speed and performance required to enable customers to access, enhance and edit their images in real-time.
Render farm. Once a customer orders a photo or any photo-based product, our render farm technology performs fully automated image processing on the image prior to production. Except for 4x6 prints, the customer’s original uploaded image is retrieved from the image archive, and automatic algorithms enhance the color, contrast and sharpness of the image. The render farm also performs customer-requested edits such as crop, borders, customized back-printing and red-eye removal.
To ensure that output is of consistent quality, we apply our proprietary ColorSure technology during this render stage. ColorSure creates an automated mapping of the image’s specific attributes to the printer’s specific print calibrations and attributes, prior to production. For example, this technology allows a 4x6 print to look the same as a photo printed on an enlargement or in a photo book, even if they are ordered at separate times.
Production system. We operate our own production facilities in Fort Mill, South Carolina; Tempe, Arizona; and Shakopee, Minnesota. Our automated production system controls our production processes, including order management and pick, pack and ship operations. Using proprietary algorithms, the production system analyzes tens of thousands of orders daily and automates the workflow into our state-of-the-art digital presses.
We continue to invest in our printing capabilities with a customer-centric focus on automation and reducing our reliance on temporary labor. To that end, in the summer of 2016, we installed a fleet of new HP10000 printers. These technology leading-printers are better quality, more efficient, and should help improve our cost structure. 
Shutterfly Photos. We also made progress toward our vision of creating a world-class memory management service connected to the smartest personalized e-commerce solutions, what we’re calling Shutterfly Photos. By modernizing our technology platform and introducing new customer-friendly features, we aim to address the friction points caused by multiple devices, fragmented storage options, and limited organization and search capabilities for interacting with photos and videos. This initiative also includes delivering a better overall user experience with more products and innovations to our customers. This experience will eventually be portable to partners, enabling us to offer third parties the ability to leverage our platform to better serve their customers. 
We intend to continue our efforts to make improvements in our platform and infrastructure including our big data strategy and analytics, e-commerce development, and manufacturing scale and automation. In particular, the scale and scope economies from our vertically integrated manufacturing and supply chain enable us to extend our competitive position and improve overall customer satisfaction, further strengthening the barriers to success in our industry. In 2017, we intend to consolidate our consumer technology platforms.
Competition
The market for digital photography products and services is large, evolving, and intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. We face intense competition from a wide range of companies, including the following:

● | Online digital photography services companies such as Snapfish, Vistaprint, and many others;

8


● | Social media companies that host and enable mobile access to and posting of images such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, Snapchat and Google+;


● | Photo hosting websites that allow users to upload and share images at no cost such as Apple iCloud, Google Photos, and Flickr;


● | “Big Box” retailers such as Wal-Mart, Costco, Sam’s Club, Target, and others that offer low cost digital photography products and services. In addition to providing low-cost competitive product offerings on their respective websites, these competitors provide in-store fulfillment and self-service kiosks for printing, and may, among other strategies, offer their customers heavily discounted in-store products and services that compete directly with our offerings;


● | Drug stores such as Walgreens, CVS/pharmacy, and others that offer low-cost photography products and services as well as in-store pick-up from their photo website Internet orders;


● | Traditional offline stationery companies such as PaperSource, Crane & Co., and Papyrus;


● | Cloud-based storage services and file-syncing services such as Dropbox, Box, Everalbum, Amazon Photos and iCloud;


● | Specialized companies in the photo book and stationery business such as Hallmark, Cardstore by American Greetings, Minted, Invitations by Dawn, Picaboo, Blurb, Mixbook, Postable, and Artifact Uprising;


● | Photo-related software companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Adobe;


● | Online and offline Companies specializing in photo merchandise and personalized home décor such as Zazzle, CafePress, Art.Com, Canvas On Demand, Personalization Mall, Personal Creations, Things Remebered, Mark & Graham, CustomInk, Teespring and Etsy.


● | Providers of digital alternatives to our products, such as Paperless Post, Evite, Animoto, and PicCollage.


● | Home printing service providers such as Hewlett-Packard and Epson that are seeking to expand their printer and ink businesses by gaining market share in the digital photography marketplace;


● | Enterprise digital and print communications companies such as RR Donnelley and Sons Company, O'Neil Data Systems, Inc., Quad/Graphics, Inc. and Viatech Publishing Solutions, Inc.;


● | Regional photography companies such as Ritz Camera that have established brands and customer bases in existing photography markets; and


● | Camera and photographic supply companies that rent equipment nationwide both online and in brick-and-mortar stores such as LensRentals.com, LensProToGo, Cameralends, AbelCine, and Adorama.

We believe the primary competitive factors in attracting and retaining customers are:

● | brand recognition and trust;


● | quality of products and services;


● | breadth of products and services;


● | user affinity and loyalty;


● | customer service;


● | ease of use;


● | convenience; and

9


● | price.

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to many of these factors, particularly customer trust and loyalty, quality and breadth of products and services, and customer service. Many of our competitors promote their products on the basis of low prices or the convenience of same-day availability for digital photos printed in drugstores or other retail outlets. Generally, we distinguish ourselves from such competitors principally on the basis of product quality and innovation, rather than price or same-day delivery.
Intellectual Property
Protecting our intellectual property rights is part of our strategy for continued growth and competitive differentiation. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark law. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and business partners, and control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.
As of December 31, 2016, we had 100 issued patents, which expire at various dates between 2019 and 2033, and more than 20 patent applications pending in the United States. Our issued patents and patent applications relate primarily to intelligent product creation; image uploading, sharing, and editing; ordering and sharing products; cloud image storage infrastructure; manufacturing optimization; mobile and social media technologies; and automated and personalized manufacturing. We intend to pursue corresponding patent coverage in additional countries to the extent we believe such coverage is appropriate and cost efficient. However, we cannot be certain that any of our pending or any future applications will be granted. In addition, third parties could bring invalidity, co-inventorship or similar claims with respect to any of our currently issued patents or any patents that may be issued to us in the future.
Our primary brands are “Shutterfly,” “Tiny Prints,” and “Wedding Paper Divas.” We hold applications and/or registrations for the Shutterfly, Tiny Prints, and Wedding Paper Divas trademarks in our major markets of the United States and Canada, as well as in the European Community. We also hold applications and registrations for the Shutterfly mark in Mexico, Japan and China, and for the Shutterfly and Tiny Prints marks in Australia and New Zealand. We own the domains Shutterfly.com, TinyPrints.com, WeddingPaperDivas.com, BorrowLenses.com and Groovebook.com among others.
Government Regulation
The legal environment of the Internet is constantly evolving in the United States and elsewhere. The manner in which existing laws and regulations will be applied to the Internet in general, and how they will relate to our business in particular, is unclear in many cases. Accordingly, we often cannot be certain how existing laws will apply in the online context, including with respect to such topics as privacy, defamation, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, sweepstakes, promotions, content regulation, net neutrality, quality of products, and services and intellectual property ownership and infringement. In particular, legal issues relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users are currently unsettled both within the United States and abroad.
Numerous laws have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States that could have an impact on our business. These laws include the following:

● | The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and similar laws adopted by a number of states. These laws are intended to regulate unsolicited commercial emails, create criminal penalties for unmarked sexually-oriented material and e-mails containing fraudulent headers and control other abusive online marketing practices.


● | The Communications Decency Act, which gives statutory protection to online service providers who distribute third-party content.


● | The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which is intended to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others.

10


● | The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003, which are intended to restrict the distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect user information from minors. In addition, the Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act of 1998 requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances.


● | Statutes adopted in the State of California and other states, require online services to report certain breaches of the security of personal data, and to report to consumers when their personal data might be disclosed to direct marketers.


● | The federal Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the "CARD Act") includes provisions governing the use of gift cards, including specific disclosure requirements and a prohibition or limitation on the use of expiration dates and fees. Each state regulates gift cards in its own manner, so long as in concert with the CARD Act. Several states are attempting to pass new laws regulating the use of gift cards and amending state escheatment laws to try to pass new laws regulating the use of gift cards and amending state escheatment laws to try and obtain unused gift card balances.


● | The Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act ("ROSCA") prohibits and prevents Internet-based post-transaction third party sales and imposes specific requirements on negative option features.


● | The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "Patient Act"), as well as other healthcare reform legislation being considered by Congress and state legislatures. Changes to our healthcare costs structure could increase our employee healthcare-related costs.

To resolve some of the remaining legal uncertainty, we expect new U.S. and foreign laws and regulations to be adopted over time that will be directly or indirectly applicable to the Internet and to our activities. In addition, government agencies may begin regulating previously unregulated Internet activities or applying existing laws in new ways to providers of online services. Moreover, the law relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and business partners is currently unsettled both within the United States and abroad. Any existing or new legislation applicable to us could expose us to government investigations or audits, prosecution for violations of applicable laws and/or substantial liability, including penalties, damages, significant attorneys’ fees and expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations or the need to modify our business practices. From time to time, claims may be threatened against us for aiding and abetting, defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of information to which we provide links or that we or others post online. On a more general level, government regulation of the Internet could dampen the growth in the use of the Internet, have the effect of discouraging innovation and investment in Internet-based enterprises or lead to unpredictable litigation.
We post on our websites our privacy policies and practices concerning the use and disclosure of user data. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, Federal Trade Commission requirements or other privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings that could potentially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In this regard, there are a large number of federal and state legislative proposals before the United States Congress and various state legislative bodies regarding privacy issues related to our business. It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted and certain proposals, such as required use of disclaimers, if adopted, could harm our business through a decrease in user registrations and revenues.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 2,084 full time employees. Below is a summary of employees by function as of December 31, for each of the last three years:

 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014
Cost of revenue | 1,018 | | 999 | | 905 
Technology and development | 585 | | 560 | | 477 
Sales and marketing | 290 | | 272 | | 259 
General and administrative | 191 | | 185 | | 171 
Total | 2,084 | | 2,016 | | 1,812

11

During the peak holiday season, we hire contract workers on a temporary basis from third-party outsourcing firms. For example, during our peak production period in the fourth quarter of 2016, we used approximately 3,800 temporary workers to assist in our production and fulfillment operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
