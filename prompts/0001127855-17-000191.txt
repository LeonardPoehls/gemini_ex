Item 1.  Business
 
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K Golden Eagle International, Inc. is referred to as "we," "our," "us," the "Company," or "Golden Eagle".
 
The Company was formed as a Colorado corporation on July 21, 1988 as Beneficial Capital Financial Services Corp.  On February 2, 1995, the Company changed its name to Golden Eagle International, Inc.
 
In 2004, the Company purchased the 3,500 to 4,500 ton-per-day Gold Bar mill which is located 25 miles northwest of Eureka, Nevada.  Initially, the Company's plan was to disassemble the mill and transport it to Bolivia to be reconstructed on mineral properties formally owned by the Company.  However, due to the costs associated with disassembling and transporting the mill to Bolivia, the Company determined that the best course of action was to leave the mill in place and explore other options, such as processing ore for third parties which had mines in the area, or selling the mill.
 
Having been unsuccessful in selling the mill, or processing ore for third parties, the Company concluded the mill would not provide any meaningful value to the Company's shareholders.  Accordingly, on October 30, 2015, the Company agreed to sell the mill to Gulf Coast Capital, LLC, an entity controlled by Mark Bogani, a former officer and director of the Company, in consideration for Gulf Coast assuming all of the Company's liabilities.  On July 20, 2016, the agreement relating to the sale of the Gold Bar Mill was terminated by the mutual consent of the Company and Gulf Coast Capital.
 
The mill was not in operation when the Company acquired it, and it has not been in operation since it was acquired by the Company.
 
On October 30, 2015, the Company issued 160,000 shares of its Series B Preferred stock to Gulf Coast Capital, LLC in satisfaction of related party debt in the amount of $1,000.  Gulf Coast Capital is controlled by Mark Bogani, who was the Company's Chief Executive Officer between October 1, 2015 and October 8, 2016.
 
During August and September 2016, the Company sold 4,000,000 shares of its common stock, as well as warrants to purchase an additional 6,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, to a group of private investors for $100,000.  The warrants are exercisable at prices between $0.05 and $0.20 per share at any time between June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2019.
 
On October 28, 2016, the Company acquired Advantego Technologies, Inc. in exchange for 127,915,000 shares of the Company's common stock.
 
In connection with this acquisition, the following management changes took place on October 28, 2016:
