(a) | General Development of Business
----+--------------------------------

      During November 2015, the board of directors of Liberty Interactive Corporation ("Liberty Interactive") authorized management to pursue a plan to distribute to holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock shares of a newly formed entity, Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc. ("Expedia Holdings," the "Company," “us,” “we,” or “our” as discussed below) (the "Expedia Holdings Split-Off"). Following the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, Expedia Holdings is comprised of, among other things, Liberty Interactive's former ownership interest in Expedia, Inc. ("Expedia"), as well as Liberty Interactive's former wholly-owned subsidiary Bodybuilding.com, LLC. As of December 31, 2016, Expedia Holdings beneficially owned approximately 15.7% of the outstanding Expedia common stock and 52.3% of the voting interest in Expedia. Bodybuilding.com, LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive in October 2015 when Liberty Interactive purchased the remaining ownership interest in Bodybuilding.com, LLC. In 2016, Bodybuilding.com, LLC underwent a corporate restructuring, which resulted in Bodybuilding.com, LLC becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitalize, LLC (“Vitalize”).
     The Expedia Holdings Split-Off was accomplished by the redemption by Liberty Interactive on a per share basis of, (i) 0.4 of each outstanding share of Liberty Interactive’s Series A Liberty Ventures common stock as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 4, 2016 (such date and time, the “Redemption Date”) for 0.4 of a share of Expedia Holdings’ Series A common stock, and (ii) 0.4 of each outstanding share of Liberty Interactive’s Series B Liberty Ventures common stock as of the Redemption Date for 0.4 of a share of Expedia Holdings’ Series B common stock, with cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Liberty Interactive’s Series A and Series B Liberty Ventures common stock and Expedia Holdings’ Series A and Series B common stock. Following the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, Expedia Holdings and Liberty Interactive operate as separate, publicly traded companies. The Expedia Holdings Split-Off was intended to be tax-free to Liberty Interactive and stockholders of Liberty Ventures. In February 2017, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) completed its review of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off and informed Liberty that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the transactions. Liberty Interactive received an Issue Resolution Agreement from the IRS documenting this conclusion.
 Historically, Liberty Interactive was (and, following the completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, the Company is) a party to a stockholders agreement (the “Stockholders Agreement”) with Mr. Barry Diller, Chairman of the Board and Senior Executive Officer of Expedia, pursuant to which Mr. Diller held an irrevocable proxy (the “Diller Proxy”) over all the shares of Expedia common stock ("EXPE") and Expedia class B common stock (the “Expedia class B common stock,” and together with EXPE, the “Expedia common stock”) then owned by Liberty Interactive. Liberty Interactive was also subject to a governance agreement (the “Governance Agreement”) with Expedia which provided for the right to nominate 20% of the members of Expedia's board of directors, which was comprised of 13 members (three of which were nominated by Liberty Interactive). The Governance Agreement also provided for registration and other rights and imposed certain restrictions on the ownership of shares of Expedia class B common stock. Pursuant to the Governance Agreement, Liberty Interactive had (and, following the completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, the Company has) preemptive rights that entitle it to purchase a number of shares of Expedia common stock (excluding certain issuances related to options, warrants or convertible securities) so that Liberty Interactive or the Company, as applicable, would or will maintain the identical ownership interest in Expedia (subject to certain adjustments) that it had immediately prior to such issuance or proposed issuance (but not in excess of 20.01%). Any purchase by Liberty Interactive or the Company, as applicable, would or will be allocated between EXPE and Expedia class B common stock in the same proportion as the issuance or issuances giving rise to the preemptive right, except to the extent that Liberty Interactive or the Company, as applicable, opted or opts to acquire shares of EXPE in lieu of shares of Expedia class B common stock. Based on the Stockholders Agreement and the Governance Agreement, the Company determined that, prior to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, it did not control Expedia but instead had significant influence with respect to Expedia and accordingly, accounted for its investment in Expedia as an equity method affiliate. 
 In connection with the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, (a), the Governance Agreement and Stockholders Agreement were assigned by Liberty Interactive to the Company and (b) Mr. Diller ceased to directly control a majority voting interest in Expedia by irrevocably assigning (the “Diller Assignment”) the Diller Proxy to the Company for a period of time up to 18 months following completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, subject to certain termination events as described in the Amended and Restated Transaction Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2016, among Mr. Diller, John C. Malone (“Malone”), Leslie Malone (“Mrs. Malone” and together with Malone, the “Malone Group”), Liberty Interactive and the Company (the “Amended and Restated Transaction Agreement” and the date on which such termination event occurs, the 

 
  I-1

 
“Proxy Arrangement Termination Date”). By virtue of (i) certain governance rights with respect to the Company as set forth in the Company’s restated certificate of incorporation (the “restated charter”), an amendment to the Stockholders Agreement and the Amended and Restated Transaction Agreement and (ii) the grant by the Malone Group to Mr. Diller of an irrevocable proxy to vote, subject to certain exceptions, shares of the Company’s common stock beneficially owned by the Malone Group upon the completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off or thereafter for a period of time ending upon termination of Mr. Diller's assignment of the Diller Proxy (the arrangements described in clauses (i) and (ii), together with the Diller Assignment, the “proxy arrangements”), Mr. Diller will be able to elect and replace the directors of the Company who will determine how the Company will exercise certain rights and vote the shares of EXPE and Expedia class B common stock owned by the Company in the election of Expedia directors, though Malone will retain the ability to remove such directors of the Company. The rights under the Governance Agreement and Stockholders Agreement, each as assigned and amended, will be maintained even upon termination of the proxy arrangements. As a result, Expedia Holdings began consolidating Expedia as of the completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, as Expedia Holdings then controlled a majority of the voting interest in Expedia.

     Expedia
     Expedia is an online travel company, empowering business and leisure travelers through technology with the tools and information they need to efficiently research, plan, book and experience travel. Expedia seeks to grow its business through a dynamic portfolio of travel brands, including its majority owned subsidiaries that feature a broad supply portfolio—including more than 350,000 properties and over 1.2 million online bookable vacation rental listings in approximately 200 countries, over 500 airlines, packages, rental cars, cruises, as well as destination services and activities. Travel suppliers distribute and market products via Expedia’s traditional desktop and mobile offerings, as well as through alternative distribution channels including social media, its private label business and its call centers in order to reach its extensive, global audience. In addition, Expedia’s advertising and media businesses help other businesses, primarily travel providers, reach a large audience of travelers around the globe.
     Expedia is focused on revolutionizing travel through the power of technology. Expedia believes the strength of its brand portfolio as well as its enhanced product offerings and new channel penetration drives customer demand, which when combined with its global scale and broad based supply, gives Expedia a unique advantage in addressing the ongoing migration of travel bookings from offline to online around the world. With Expedia's unmatched global audience of travelers, and its deep and broad selection of travel products, there is a rich interplay between supply and demand in Expedia's global marketplace that helps it provide value to both travelers planning trips and supply partners wanting to grow their business through a better understanding of travel retailing and consumer demand in addition to reaching consumers in markets beyond their reach. Expedia's primary growth drivers are technology and product innovation, global expansion, and new channel penetration.
     Portfolio of Brands
     Expedia operates a strong brand portfolio with global reach, targeting a broad range of travelers, travel suppliers and advertisers. Expedia knows that consumers typically visit multiple travel sites prior to booking travel, and having a multi-brand strategy increases the likelihood that those consumers will visit one or more of its sites. Expedia also markets to consumers through a variety of channels, including internet search and metasearch sites, and having multiple brands appear in search results also increases the likelihood of attracting visitors. Expedia's brands tailor their product offerings and websites to particular traveler demographics. For example, Hotwire finds deep discount deals for the budget-minded travel shopper while the Classic Vacations brand targets high-end, luxury travelers. Brand Expedia spans the widest swath of potential customers with travel options across a broad value spectrum, while the Hotels.com brand focuses specifically on a hotel only product offering.
     Expedia organizes its company around key platforms. The Brand Expedia Group consists of Expedia’s multi-product brands, including Brand Expedia, Orbitz, Travelocity, Wotif Group and Expedia Local Expert. In addition, Expedia’s Hotwire brand also offers consumers reservations for hotel, airline tickets and rental cars. 
     Brand Expedia. Brand Expedia is a leading full-service online travel brand with localized sites in 33 countries offering a wide selection of travel products and services. Through award-winning mobile apps and Expedia-branded websites, travelers have access to the latest technology that delivers airline tickets, lodging, car rentals, rail, cruises, insurance and many things to do — such as airport transfers, activities and tours — from hundreds of thousands of suppliers, on both a standalone and package basis. Across the more than 20 years that Expedia has been helping people travel with confidence and ease, the company has learned that travelers benefit when Expedia continually improves and optimizes its offering, to ensure that travelers the world over can book the trip they need, in the manner they choose, at any point and save. That commitment has propelled Expedia to a leadership position within travel, and ensures that Expedia can continue to help millions of travelers experience the world.

With CarRentals.com’s international expansion, it is able to provide Expedia’s customers more choices across the globe and help its supply partners expand their marketing reach.
     Growth Strategy
     Product Innovation.    Each of Expedia’s leading brands was a pioneer in online travel and has been responsible for driving key innovations in the space over the past two decades. Each Expedia technology platform is operated by a dedicated technology team, which drives innovations that make researching and shopping for travel increasingly easier and help customers find and book the best possible travel options. In the past several years, Expedia made key investments in technology, including significant development of its technical platforms that makes it possible for Expedia to deliver innovations at a faster pace. For example, Expedia launched new global platforms for Hotels.com and Brand Expedia, enabling it to significantly increase the innovation cycle, thereby improving conversion and driving faster growth rates for those brands. In 2013, Expedia signed an agreement to power the technology, supply and customer service platforms for Travelocity-branded sites in the United States and Canada, enabling Expedia to leverage its investments in each of these key areas. The shift of Travelocity-branded sites to the Expedia technology platform was successfully completed over the course of 2014. In November 2014, Expedia completed the acquisition of Wotif Group and subsequently converted the Wotif.com site to the Expedia platform. In January 2015, Expedia acquired the Travelocity brand and other associated assets from Sabre. The strategic marketing and other related agreements previously entered into were terminated. In September 2015, Expedia completed the acquisition of Orbitz Worldwide, including all of its brands. The migration of the Orbitz.com, CheapTickets.com and ebookers sites to the Expedia technology platform was completed in the first half of 2016, and Orbitz for Business customers were migrated to the Egencia technology platform as of July 2016. In December 2015, Expedia completed the acquisition of HomeAway, including all of its brands. Expedia intends to continue leveraging these investments when launching additional points of sale in new countries, introducing new website features, adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings, as well as proprietary and user-generated content for travelers.
     Global Expansion.    The Expedia, Hotels.com, Egencia, and EAN brands operate both domestically and through international points of sale, including in Europe, Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America. In addition, ebookers offers multi-product online reservation in Europe and Wotif Group includes a leading portfolio of travel brands, including Wotif.com, Wotif.co.nz, lastminute.com.au, lastminute.com.nz and travel.com.au. Egencia, Expedia’s corporate travel

business, operates in over 65 countries around the world and continues to expand, including its 2012 acquisition of VIA Travel. The HomeAway portfolio has over 50 vacation rental sites all around the world. Expedia owns a majority share of trivago, a leading hotel metasearch company. Officially launched in 2005, trivago is one of the best known travel brands in Europe and North America. trivago continues to operate independently and rapidly grow revenue through global expansion, including aggressive expansion in new countries. In December 2016, trivago successfully completed its IPO and trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “TRVG.” In addition, Expedia has commercial agreements in place with Ctrip International, Ltd. (“Ctrip”) and eLong, Inc. (“eLong”) in China, as well as Decolar.com, Inc. in Latin America. In 2016, approximately 36% of Expedia’s worldwide gross bookings and 43% of worldwide revenue were through international points of sale compared to just 21% for both worldwide gross bookings and revenue in 2005. Expedia has a goal of generating at least 65% of its revenue through businesses and points of sale outside of the United States.
     In expanding its global reach, Expedia leverages significant investments in technology, operations, brand building, supplier relationships and other initiatives that it has made since the launch of Expedia.com in 1996. Expedia’s scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations it introduces on behalf of its travelers and suppliers. Expedia believes that its size and scale afford the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with its supply partners, provide breadth of choice and travel deals to its traveling customers through an expanding supply portfolio and create opportunities for new value added offers for its customers such as its loyalty programs. The size of Expedia’s worldwide traveler base makes its sites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers. In addition, the sheer size of Expedia’s user base and search query volume allows Expedia to test new technologies very quickly in order to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process, and then roll those features out to its worldwide audience in order to drive improvements in conversion.
     New Channel Penetration.    Technological innovations and developments continue to create new opportunities for travel bookings made through mobile devices, in addition to more traditional methods like desktop and laptop computers. In the past few years, each of Expedia’s brands made significant progress creating new mobile websites and mobile applications that are receiving strong reviews and solid download trends, and some of Expedia’s brands now see more traffic via mobile devices than via traditional desktops. Mobile bookings via smartphones continue to present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are often completed within one or two days of the travel or stay, which is a much shorter booking window than Expedia had historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods. In addition, Expedia is seeing increasing cross-device usage among its customers, who connect to Expedia’s websites and apps across multiple devices and platforms throughout their travel planning process. Expedia also believes mobile represents an efficient marketing channel given the opportunity for direct traffic acquisition, increase in share of wallet and in repeat customers, particularly through mobile applications. During the year ended December 31, 2016, nearly one in three Expedia transactions were booked globally on a mobile device.
     Business Models
     Expedia makes travel products and services available both on a stand-alone and package basis, primarily through the following business models: the merchant model, the agency model and the advertising model. In addition, upon Expedia’s acquisition of HomeAway in December 2015, Expedia also earns revenue related to subscription-based vacation rental listing and other ancillary services provided to property owners and managers as well as from the traveler service fee that was rolled out in the United States and Europe in the first half of 2016.
     Under the merchant model, Expedia facilitates the booking of hotel rooms, airline seats, car rentals and destination services from its travel suppliers and Expedia is the merchant of record for such bookings. The majority of Expedia’s merchant transactions relate to hotel bookings. Under the agency model, Expedia facilitates travel bookings and acts as the agent in the transaction, passing reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel provider. Expedia receives commissions or ticketing fees from the travel supplier and/or traveler.
     Expedia continues to see closer integration of the agency hotel product with its core merchant product through its Expedia Traveler Preference (“ETP”) program by offering, for participating hotels, customers the choice of whether to pay Expedia in advance under Expedia’s merchant program (Expedia Collect) or pay at the hotel at the time of the stay (Hotel Collect). Growth in Expedia’s ETP program has generally resulted in reduced negotiated economics to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs, and as Expedia continues to expand the breadth and depth of its global hotel offering, it has made and expects to continue to make adjustments to 

 
  I-7

 
its economics in various geographies including changes based on local market conditions. Based on these dynamics, Expedia expects its revenue per room night to remain under pressure in the future.
     Through various of the Expedia-branded and other websites, travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages in a single transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately. Packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites primarily include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component. Travelers select packages based on the total package price, without being provided component pricing. The use of the merchant travel components in packages enables Expedia to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their other models. In addition, Expedia also offers third-party pre-assembled package offerings, primarily through its international points of sale, further broadening its scope of products and services to travelers. Expedia expects the package product to continue to be marketed primarily using the merchant model.
     Under the advertising model, Expedia offers travel and non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through its various media and advertising offerings on trivago and its transaction-based websites.
     With its acquisition of HomeAway and all of its brands in December 2015, Expedia has expanded into the fast growing $100 billion alternative accommodations market. HomeAway is a leader in this market and represents an attractive growth opportunity for Expedia. HomeAway has been undergoing a transition from a listings-based classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and property manager partners, with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology. In addition, HomeAway rolled out a traveler service fee in the United States and Europe during the first half of 2016, consistent with market practice. The fee is expected to continue to contribute to HomeAway’s revenue growth and help fund marketing investment, programs to better protect travelers and future growth initiatives. Furthermore, HomeAway moved to a single subscription option globally in July 2016.
     Relationships with Travel Partners
     Overview.    Expedia makes travel products and services available from a variety of hotel companies, large and small commercial airlines, car rental companies, cruise lines, destination service providers and HomeAway property owners and managers. Expedia seeks to build and maintain long-term, strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system (“GDS”) partners. An important component of the success of Expedia's business depends on its ability to maintain its existing, as well as build new, relationships with travel suppliers and GDS partners.
     Travel Suppliers.    Expedia strives to deliver value to its travel supply partners through a wide range of innovative, targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to generate consumer demand and increase their revenue, while simultaneously reducing their overall marketing transaction and customer service costs. Expedia's strategic account managers and local hotel market managers work directly with travel suppliers to optimize the exposure of their travel products and brands through Expedia's points of sale, including participation in need-based, seasonal and event-driven promotions and experimentation within the new channels Expedia is building.
     Expedia has developed proprietary, supplier-oriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of its websites and hotel central reservation systems, making it easier and more cost-effective for hotels to manage reservations made through Expedia's brands. Through this "direct connect" technology, hotels can upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into Expedia's websites, as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by Expedia's travelers. In the absence of direct connect technology, both of these processes are generally completed via a proprietary extranet.
     In addition, HomeAway's vacation rental listing services includes a set of tools for property owners or managers, which enables them to manage an availability calendar, reservations, inquiries and the content of the listing, as well as provide various other services for property owners or managers to manage reservations or drive incremental sales volume.
     Distribution Partners.    GDSs, also referred to as computer reservation services, provide a centralized, comprehensive repository of travel suppliers' 'content'—such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline point-to-point flights, or 'segments'. The GDSs act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies, allowing agents to reserve and book flights, rooms or other travel products. Expedia's relationships with GDSs primarily relate to 

 
  I-8

 
its air business. Expedia uses Sabre, Amadeus and Travelport as its GDS segment providers in order to ensure the widest possible supply of content for Expedia's travelers.
     Marketing and Promotions
     Expedia's marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of its various brands, drive traffic and ultimately bookings through its various brands and businesses, optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position its brands in relation to one another. Expedia's long-term success and profitability depends on its continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions flowing through its brand and shared global platforms in a cost-effective manner, as well as its ability to attract repeat customers to its sites.
     Expedia's marketing channels primarily include online advertising, including search engine marketing and optimization, as well as metasearch, social media sites, offline advertising, loyalty programs, mobile apps and direct and/or personalized traveler communications on its websites as well as through direct e-mail communication with its travelers. Expedia's marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from its travel suppliers based on its supplier relationships. Expedia's traveler loyalty programs include Hotels.com Rewards on Hotels.com global websites and Expedia® + rewards on over 30 Brand Expedia points of sale, as well as Orbitz Rewards on Orbitz.com. The cost of these loyalty programs is recorded as a reduction of revenue in Expedia's consolidated financial statements.
     Expedia also makes use of affiliate marketing. The Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Hotwire, Travelocity, HomeAway, Wotif and lastminute.com.au branded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clicked-through to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites. Affiliate partners can also make travel products and services available on their own websites through a Brand Expedia, Hotels.com or HomeAway co-branded offering or a private label website. Expedia's EAN business provides its affiliates with technology and access to a wide range of products and services. Expedia manages agreements with thousands of third-party affiliate partners, including a number of leading travel companies, pursuant to which it pays a commission for bookings originated from their websites.
     Operations and Technology
     Expedia operates several technology platforms that support its brands. The Brand Expedia technology platform supports Expedia’s full-service and multi-product brands, including Brand Expedia, Orbitz, Travelocity, Wotif Group and Expedia Local Expert, as well as certain parts of the Hotwire brand. The Hotels.com technology platform supports Expedia’s hotel-only offering, including Hotels.com Worldwide and EAN. In addition, Expedia operates Egencia, its corporate travel platform; HomeAway, Expedia’s vacation rentals platform; and trivago, the hotel-only metasearch platform.
     All of Expedia’s brands share and benefit from its corporate technology infrastructure, including customer support, data centers and transaction processing capabilities.
     Expedia provides 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week traveler sales and support by telephone or via e-mail. For purposes of operational flexibility, Expedia uses a combination of outsourced and in-house call centers. Expedia's call centers are located throughout the world, including outsourced operations in the Philippines, El Salvador, Egypt and India. Expedia invested significantly in its call center technologies, with the goal of improving customer experience and increasing the efficiency of its call center agents, and has plans to continue reaping the benefits of these investments going forward.
     Expedia's systems infrastructure and web and database servers are housed in various locations, mainly in the United States, which have 24-hour monitoring and engineering support, as well as in the public cloud. These data centers have their own generators and multiple back-up systems. Significant amounts of Expedia's owned computer hardware for operating the websites are located at these facilities. For some critical systems, Expedia has both production and disaster-recovery facilities. Expedia's technology systems are subject to certain risks, which are described in "Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors."
     Intellectual Property
     Expedia's intellectual property rights, including its patents, trademarks, copyright, domain names, trade dress, proprietary technology and trade secrets, are an important component of its business. For example, Expedia relies heavily upon its intellectual property and proprietary information in its content, brands, software code, proprietary technology, 

 
  I-9

 
ratings indexes, informational databases, images, graphics and other components that make up its services. Expedia has acquired some of its intellectual property rights and proprietary information through acquisitions, as well as licenses and content agreements with third parties.
     Expedia protects its intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on its terms of use, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, as well as international, national, state and common law rights. In addition, Expedia enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors, and license and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use Expedia's trade secrets or its intellectual property and proprietary information without authorization which, if discovered, might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties.
     Expedia maintains its trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with the appropriate international trademark offices, maintaining appropriate registrations, securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate, and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate. Expedia also registers copyrights and domain names as it deems appropriate. Expedia protects its trademarks, copyrights and domain names with an enforcement program and use of intellectual property licenses. Trademark and intellectual property protection may not be available or may not be sought, sufficient or effective in every jurisdiction where Expedia operates. Contractual disputes or limitations may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract.
     Expedia has considered, and will continue to consider, the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions, as circumstances may warrant. However, patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by Expedia.
     Seasonality
     Expedia generally experiences seasonal fluctuations in the demand for its travel products and services. For example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and winter holiday travel. The number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter. Because revenue for most of Expedia’s travel products, including merchant and agency hotel, is recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer. The seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of Expedia's variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs, which it typically realizes in closer alignment to booking volumes, and the more stable nature of its fixed costs. Furthermore, operating profits for Expedia's primary advertising business, trivago, are experienced in the second half of the year, as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as Expedia aggressively markets during the busy booking period for spring, summer and winter holiday travel. Additionally, trivago has historically earned a substantial portion of its operating profits in the fourth quarter. As a result on a consolidated basis, revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. The continued growth of Expedia's international operations, advertising business or a change in its product mix, including the assimilation and growth of HomeAway, may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future. Expedia expects that as HomeAway continues its shift to more of a transaction-based business model for vacation rental listings, its seasonal trends will generally trend similar to Expedia’s other traditional leisure businesses over time.
     Terms of Investment in Expedia
     Historically, Liberty Interactive was a party to a Stockholders Agreement with Mr. Diller, pursuant to which Mr. Diller held an irrevocable proxy over all the shares of Expedia common stock owned by Liberty Interactive. In connection with the Expedia Holdings Split-Off and the proxy arrangements, the Stockholders Agreement was assigned to us and amended to permit the assignment of the Diller Proxy to our company through the Proxy Arrangement Termination Date pursuant to the proxy arrangements. As a result, we began consolidating Expedia as of the completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, as Expedia Holdings then controlled a majority of the voting interest in Expedia for accounting purposes. Additionally, in conjunction with the application of acquisition accounting, we recorded a full step up in basis of Expedia along with a gain between our historical basis and the fair value of our interest in Expedia. Liberty Interactive was also subject to a Governance Agreement with Expedia, which was assigned to us in connection with the Expedia Holdings Split-Off and which provides us following the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, with certain director nomination and other rights and imposes certain restrictions on the ownership of shares of Expedia class B common stock. We will 

 
  I-10

 
maintain our rights under the Governance Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement, each as assigned and amended, even upon termination of the proxy arrangements.
     Bodybuilding Restructuring
     In 2016, Bodybuilding.com, LLC underwent a corporate restructuring, which resulted in Bodybuilding.com, LLC becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitalize. Effective November 17, 2016, Bodybuilding.com, LLC amended its Certificate of Formation in the State of Delaware to change its name to Vitalize, LLC, and a new Bodybuilding.com, LLC (“Bodybuilding”) was formed in the state of Delaware, effective November 1, 2016. In addition to the new Bodybuilding, which will continue to offer online retail sales of dietary supplements, Vitalize also formed Verity Nutrition, LLC (“Verity Nutrition”) on August 23, 2016 and WeMotivate, LLC (“WeMotivate”) on October 19, 2016, both of which are also wholly-owned subsidiaries of Vitalize. Financial results for Vitalize are all attributable to Bodybuilding, its wholly owned subsidiary, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.       Vitalize
     Vitalize, a Delaware limited liability company, is a holding company engaged in health, fitness, and media-related business segments. Vitalize currently has three wholly-owned operating subsidiaries: Bodybuilding, WeMotivate, and Verity Nutrition. Vitalize is focused on pursuing a value-oriented investment strategy, growing attractive businesses, and creating a diverse portfolio of health and fitness related companies.  Vitalize provides expertise to incubate new products and brands that address market opportunities and generate attractive returns. Vitalize provides support to its established and emerging businesses by providing strategic guidance, capital and shared operational and financial services to its subsidiaries.
     Vitalize is a wholly owned subsidiary of Expedia Holdings.
     WeMotivate and Verity Nutrition

 WeMotivate is a full-service media and advertising production and distribution company providing custom creative services, media solutions, and media planning and buying services. It delivers offline content, online content, and advertising for Vitalize subsidiaries and other third party partners and clients. 
     Verity Nutrition develops private label products and fitness accessories designed for a wide range of partners and channels, including websites and brick-and-mortar stores. It formulates, facilitates the manufacturing process for, and delivers high-quality supplements and accelerates the brand and product development cycle for Vitalize companies and other third party partners.  
     Bodybuilding
     Bodybuilding is primarily an Internet retailer of sports, fitness and dietary supplements and other health and wellness products. Bodybuilding markets approximately 550 globally recognized brands, including several brands exclusive to its retail channel. Through its website and mobile applications, Bodybuilding offers directly to its customers one of the largest varieties of supplements, vitamins, minerals, exercise products, and clothing and exercise equipment, with approximately 18,000 stock keeping units, and delivers its products primarily through its fulfillment centers.
     Bodybuilding is one of the largest e-retailers in the nutritional and dietary-supplement industry, based on data from the Nutritional Business Journal. It also publishes a significant amount of online health and fitness content, offering complimentary fitness content, workout programs, video trainers, articles, recipes, health advice and motivational stories. Bodybuilding's online model also includes a combination of detailed product information and real-time user reviews to help its visitors select products designed to aid in achieving their health and fitness goals. Bodybuilding's website, Bodybuilding.com, was launched in 1999 and currently includes more than 30,000 pages of editorial content, 10,000 videos and 16,000 pages of store content.
     Visitors to Bodybuilding's website typically include approximately 30 million monthly unique visitors that create an inclusive online fitness community that allows people of all health and fitness levels to track their progress and discuss goals, techniques, supplementation and achievements. Providing customers with the information, motivation and supplements necessary to reach and maintain their health and fitness goals perpetuates website traffic, continued 

 
  I-11

 
engagement and product purchases. Bodybuilding primarily generates revenue from the online sale of products, through Bodybuilding's website and mobile applications. In addition, a limited amount of revenue is generated through advertising.
     Bodybuilding's performance is affected by industry trends including, among others, demographic trends and health and lifestyle preferences, as well as other factors, such as competition, industry media coverage and governmental actions. For example, the dietary supplement industry is subject to potential regulatory activity and other legal matters that could affect the credibility of a given product or category of products. Consumer trends may be influenced by current economic conditions, and limited product innovation, and introductions in the vitamins, minerals and supplements (“VMS”) industry can dramatically affect purchasing patterns. Even though Bodybuilding's business model allows it to respond to changing industry trends by introducing new products and adjusting its product mix and offering sales incentives, such actions may not fully alleviate adverse trends.
     Product Offerings
     Vitalize's sports nutrition consumers look for products to help maintain or supplement a healthy lifestyle. These products are used in conjunction with cardiovascular conditioning, weight training, overall wellness, and sports activities. Sports nutrition supplements include protein and weight gain powders, meal replacements, weight management, energy production, recovery enhancement and pre- and post-workout supplements. Vitalize’s sports nutrition products are offered in many convenient forms, such as powders, tablets, capsules, soft gels and liquids. In 2016, these products generated approximately 82% of Vitalize's revenue, with protein, pre-workout and post-workout supplements representing 42%, 16% and 15% of revenue, respectively. Vitalize’s other products outside of the sports nutrition category include items such as multivitamins, herbs, minerals, botanicals, probiotics, apparel and accessories.      Suppliers 
     Vitalize partners with a large number of suppliers; however, approximately 58% of inventory purchases are concentrated with its top eight suppliers. Vitalize's largest supplier accounted for approximately 17% of its merchandise purchases in fiscal year 2016. Vitalize considers numerous factors in selecting its suppliers, including, among others, quality, price, credit terms and product offerings. Vitalize does not typically enter into fixed-term supply agreements with its vendors. Vitalize strives to maintain sufficient inventory to enable it to meet customer demand and provide a high level of service to its customers.     Seasonality
     Vitalize's business is slightly seasonal. The first quarter of a given calendar year, when consumers implement their New Year's resolutions related to health and fitness, accounts for the largest percentage of company sales by quarter. There are varying degrees of seasonality throughout the remainder of the year based on key promotional events such as, among others, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Bodybuilding's annual Birthday Sale, and the Bodybuilding supplement awards.     Intellectual Property
     Vitalize's intellectual property (including trademarks, service marks, trade dress, logos, copyrights, domain names, trade secrets and proprietary technologies) is a critical part of its business. To protect its intellectual property, Vitalize relies on a combination of laws and regulations, as well as contractual restrictions. Vitalize pursues the registration of trademarks and service marks, including "Bodybuilding.com" and certain variations thereon, copyrights and domain names in the United States and certain foreign locations. Vitalize also relies on the protection of laws regarding unregistered copyrights for its proprietary software and certain other content it creates. Vitalize continues to evaluate the merits of applying for future copyright registrations. Vitalize also evaluates technology and inventions for patentability and may consider filing patent applications for future technology inventions, and relies on trade secret laws to protect its proprietary technology and other intellectual property. To further protect its intellectual property, Vitalize enters into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements with certain employees and contractors, as well as confidentiality agreements with other third parties, such as suppliers. Vitalize's private label formulations are proprietary, protected by contractual confidentiality, and subject to statutory trade secret protection where applicable.

 Regulatory Matters
     Internet Services
     Our online commerce businesses are subject, both directly and indirectly, to various laws and governmental regulations. Certain of these businesses engaged in the provision of goods and services over the Internet must comply with federal and state laws and regulations applicable to online communications and commerce. For example, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) prohibits web sites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without parental consent and imposes a number of operational requirements. In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) adopted regulations implementing COPPA. Certain email activities are subject to the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, commonly known as the CAN-SPAM Act. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates the sending of unsolicited commercial email by requiring the email sender, among other things, to comply with specific disclosure requirements and to provide an "opt-out" mechanism for recipients. Both of these laws include statutory penalties for non-compliance. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act limits, but does not eliminate, liability for listing or linking to third party websites that may include content that infringes on copyrights or other rights so long as our Internet businesses comply with the statutory requirements. Various states also have adopted laws regulating certain aspects of Internet communications. On February 24, 2016, the President signed legislation that permanently extends the moratorium on state and local taxes on Internet access and commerce.
     Our online commerce businesses are subject to domestic and foreign laws governing the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally-identifiable information about their users. In particular, the collection and use of personal information by companies has received increased regulatory scrutiny on a global basis. The enactment, interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux, and the interpretation and application of such laws may vary from country to country. For example, in April 2016, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation which established new data laws that give customers additional rights and impose additional restrictions and penalties on companies for illegal collection and misuse of personal information. The new data laws take effect in May 2018. Further, on October 6, 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the "Safe Harbor Framework," which had allowed companies to collect and process personal data in European Union nations for use in the U.S. In early 2016, European Union and U.S. authorities reached agreement on a new data transfer framework, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which became fully operational on August 1, 2016, but which is the subject of litigation. Finally, on January 10, 2017, the European Commission proposed new regulations regarding privacy and electronic communications, including additional regulation of the Internet tracking tools known as "cookies." 
 In the U.S., the FTC has proposed a privacy policy framework, and the new Congress may impose legislation that would require organizations that suffer a breach of security related to personal information to notify owners of such information. Many states have adopted laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach affecting personal data, such as California's Information Practices Act. Complying with these different national and state privacy requirements may cause the Internet companies in which we have interests to incur substantial costs. In addition, such companies generally have and post on their websites privacy policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data. A failure to comply with such posted privacy policies or with the regulatory requirements of federal, state, or foreign privacy laws could result in proceedings or actions by governmental agencies or others (such as class action litigation) which could adversely affect our online commerce businesses. Technical violations of certain privacy laws can result in significant penalties, including statutory penalties. In 2012, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) amended its regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), which could subject our Internet businesses to increased liability for certain telephonic communications with customers, including but not limited to text messages to mobile phones. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble such damage awards for willful or knowing violations. Data collection, privacy and security are growing public concerns. If consumers were to decrease their use of our Internet businesses' websites to purchase products and services, the businesses could be harmed. Congress and individual states may consider additional online privacy legislation.
     Goods sold over the Internet also must comply with traditional regulatory requirements, such as the FTC requirements regarding truthful and accurate claims. Other Internet-related laws and regulations enacted in the future may cover issues such as defamatory speech, copyright infringement, pricing and characteristics and quality of products and services. The future adoption of such laws or regulations may slow the growth of commercial online services and the Internet, which could in turn cause a decline in the demand for the services and products of our online commerce businesses and increase their costs of doing business or otherwise have an adverse effect on their businesses, operating results and financial conditions. Moreover, the applicability to commercial online services and the Internet of existing laws governing issues 

 
  I-13

 
such as property ownership, libel, personal privacy and taxation is uncertain and could expose these companies to substantial liability.
     In 2015, the FCC adopted rules in its open Internet proceeding that could restrict the ability of broadband providers to block or otherwise disadvantage our business. Among other things, the open Internet rules prohibit Internet service providers from: (1) blocking access to, or impairing or degrading, legal content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; and (2) favoring selected Internet traffic. On June 14, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied petitions for review filed by several broadband providers challenging the new open Internet rules, but additional appeals remain pending. Congress or the FCC may modify or repeal the open Internet rules. 
     Proposed Changes in Regulation.    The regulation of Internet services, online sales and other forms of product marketing is subject to the political process and has been in constant flux over the past decade. Further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated and there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by future legislation, new regulation or deregulation.
     Expedia
     Expedia must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry, the vacation rental industry and the provision of travel services, including registration in various states as "sellers of travel" and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds. In addition, Expedia's businesses are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation, including those relating to advertising and accessibility.
     As Expedia continues to expand the reach of its brands into the European, Asia-Pacific and other international markets, it is increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents or tour operators in those markets, including, in some countries, pricing display requirements, licensing and registration requirements, mandatory bonding and travel indemnity fund contributions, industry specific value-added tax regimes and laws regulating the provision of travel packages. For example, the European Economic Community Council Directive on Package Travel, Package Holidays and Package Tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages, such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package, including supplier failure. New European Union regulations regarding package tours are scheduled to take effect in 2018. 
     Additionally, Expedia is subject to consumer protection, privacy and consumer data, labor, economic and trade sanction programs, tax, and anti-trust and competition laws and regulations around the world that are not specific to the travel industry. Some of these laws and regulations have not historically been applied in the context of online travel companies, so there can be uncertainty regarding how these requirements relate to Expedia's various business models.
     Vitalize
     The Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) is the regulatory agency with principal oversight authority for the products Vitalize offers, and the FTC regulates the advertising of those products. Vitalize's internal legal department reviews all aspects of its FDA and FTC regulatory processes for compliance with regulations. Vitalize has established processes to review the underlying safety and efficacy of its branded products, which include review of the ingredients' safety information, product formulation, product form, product labeling, the efficacy and claim support for the product and any marketing materials. All consumer communications that deal with product and health issues must be approved by Vitalize's compliance team prior to being disseminated to the public. Vitalize also has standard procedures whereby all potential contract manufacturers are reviewed and approved before they can supply any of Vitalize's branded products. In addition, all potential new products are evaluated and approved prior to being accepted into the branded product lines.
     Vitalize's relationships with manufacturers require that all of its branded products not be adulterated or misbranded under any provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, including, but not limited to, compliance with applicable Current Good Manufacturing Practices. This requires, among other things, that ingredients in Vitalize's products must be tested for identity, purity, quality, strength and composition before being incorporated into branded products, and that Vitalize's final branded products must again be tested for identity, purity, quality, strength and composition prior to being released. All of these products require a certificate of analysis, which includes certification to 100% of label claims. Vitalize has established a standard quality control operating procedure that calls for on-site audits of its contract manufacturers' facilities and processes. Vitalize also requires that its manufacturers 

 
  I-14

 
have certificates of analysis (such as for microbial testing and label testing). Third party vendors are also subject to a standard review, must comply with Vitalize's vendor partnership agreement and are required to carry adequate insurance policies to satisfy Vitalize's standards. Each new product proposed to be carried by Vitalize is reviewed by its legal department, which rejects those products that it believes may present undue risk or be unsafe.
     Competition
     Expedia
     Expedia's brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets. Expedia believes international markets represent especially large opportunities for Expedia and those of its competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad to achieve global scale. Expedia also believes that it is one of only a few companies that are focused on building a truly global, travel marketplace.
     Expedia's competition, which is strong and increasing, includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers, including travel agencies, tour operators, travel supplier direct websites and their call centers, consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services, large online portals and search websites, certain travel metasearch websites, mobile travel applications and social media websites, as well as traditional consumer eCommerce and group buying websites. Expedia faces these competitors in local, regional, national and/or international markets. In some cases, competitors are offering more favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult. Expedia also faces competition for customer traffic on internet search engines and metasearch websites, which impacts its customer acquisition and marketing costs.
     Expedia believes that maintaining and enhancing its brands is a critical component of its effort to compete. Expedia differentiates its brands from its competitors primarily based on the multiple channels it uses to generate demand, quality and breadth of travel products, channel features and usability, price or promotional offers, traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice, as well as offline brand efforts. The emphasis on one or more of these factors varies, depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic. Expedia's brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites. In some cases, supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers, such as long standing loyalty programs, complimentary services such as Wi-Fi, and better pricing. Expedia's websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers, and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction. Expedia faces competition from airlines, hotels, alternative accommodation sites, rental car companies, cruise operators and other travel service providers, whether working individually or collectively, some of which are suppliers to its websites. Expedia's business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape, including the emergence of new competitors or business models, and supplier consolidation.
     Vitalize
     Vitalize's performance is affected by competitive trends such as the entry of new competitors and competitors that have expanded their product selection to focus on sports nutrition. This includes many mass retailers as well as some of the largest online e-retailers. Additionally, changes in promotional strategies or expansion of product assortment by various competitors also impact competitive conditions. Vitalize believes the following are the principal competitive factors in its market:
· | pricing (including costs of shipping), selection and availability of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reliability and speed of delivery of products ordered online
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | the ability to offer relevant and engaging content;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | the accessibility and ease of use of website and mobile applications; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | customer service and support.
--+------------------------------

      Employees
     Expedia Holdings does not have any corporate employees. Subsequent to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty Media”) provides Expedia Holdings with certain transitional services pursuant to a services agreement, and certain of Liberty Interactive and/or Liberty Media's corporate employees and executive officers will provide services to Expedia Holdings. As of December 31, 2016, Expedia had approximately 20,075 full and part-time 

 
  I-15

 
employees. As of December 31, 2016, Vitalize had approximately 600 full time equivalent employees and 5 part-time employees. None of these employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Expedia Holdings believes that these employee relations are good.
