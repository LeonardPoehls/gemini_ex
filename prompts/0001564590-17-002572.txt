Item 1. Business.
General
 References to “MedEquities,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to MedEquities Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, including MedEquities Realty Operating Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (our “operating partnership”), of which we are the sole member of the sole general partner.
 We are a self-managed and self-administered company that invests in a diversified mix of healthcare properties and healthcare-related real estate debt investments. Our management team has extensive experience in acquiring, owning, developing, financing, operating, leasing and disposing of many types of healthcare properties, portfolios and operating companies. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio was comprised of 24 healthcare facilities that contain a total of 2,345 licensed beds, as well as a $10.0 million mortgage note receivable. Our properties are located in Texas, California, Nevada and South Carolina and include 17 skilled nursing facilities, two acute care hospitals, two long-term acute care hospitals, one assisted living facility, one inpatient rehabilitation facility and one medical office building. As of December 31, 2016, our triple-net leased portfolio was 100% leased and had lease expirations ranging from July 2026 to December 2031.
 On October 4, 2016, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock in which we issued 19,000,000 shares and, on October 28, 2016, issued an additional 1,434,567 shares upon the underwriters’ partial exercise of their over-allotment option. The public offering price of the shares sold in the initial public offering was $12.00 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately $245.2 million.
 Our strategy is to become an integral capital partner with high-quality, facility-based, growth-minded providers of healthcare services, primarily through net-leased real estate investments, and to continue to diversify over time based on our facility types, tenants and geographic locations. We invest primarily in real estate across the acute and post-acute spectrum of care, where our management team has extensive experience and relationships and which we believe differentiates us from other healthcare real estate investors. We believe acute and post-acute healthcare facilities have the potential to provide higher risk-adjusted returns compared to other forms of net-leased real estate assets due to the specialized expertise and insight necessary to own, finance and operate these properties, which are factors that tend to limit competition among owners, operators and finance companies. We target healthcare providers or operators that provide higher acuity services, are experienced, growth-minded and that we believe have shown an ability to successfully navigate a changing healthcare landscape. We believe that by investing in facilities that span the acute and post-acute spectrum of care, we will be able to adapt to, and capitalize on, changes in the healthcare industry and support, grow and develop long-term relationships with providers that serve the highest number of patients at the highest-yielding end of the healthcare real estate market. We expect to invest primarily in the following types of healthcare properties: acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, short-stay surgical and specialty hospitals (such as those focusing on orthopedic, heart, and other dedicated surgeries and specialty procedures), dedicated specialty hospitals (such as inpatient rehabilitation facilities, long-term acute care hospitals and facilities providing psychiatric care), large and prominent physician clinics, diagnostic facilities, outpatient surgery centers and facilities that support these services, such as medical office buildings. Over the long-term, we expect our portfolio to be balanced equally between acute and post-acute facilities, although the balance may fluctuate from time to time due to the impact of individual transactions.
 We intend to continue to capitalize on what we expect will be a need for significantly higher levels of capital investment in new and updated healthcare properties resulting from an aging U.S. population, increasing access to traditional healthcare services enabled by healthcare reform legislation, increasing regulatory oversight, rapidly changing technology and continuing focus on reducing healthcare costs. We believe these factors present opportunities for us to provide flexible capital solutions to healthcare providers as they seek the capital required to modernize their facilities, operate more efficiently and improve patient care.
 While our preferred form of investment is fee ownership of a facility with a long-term triple-net lease with the healthcare provider or operator, we also may provide debt financing to healthcare providers, typically in the form of mortgage or mezzanine loans. In addition, we may provide capital to finance the development of healthcare properties, which we may use as a pathway to the ultimate acquisition of pre-leased properties by including purchase options or rights of first offer in the loan agreements.
 We were incorporated in Maryland on April 23, 2014, and we are the sole member of the general partner of our operating partnership. All of our assets are held by, and our operations are conducted through, our operating partnership. As of December 31, 2016, we owned all of the outstanding units of limited partnership interest (“OP units”) of our operating partnership. We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2014.
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe that the following competitive strengths will support the accretive growth of our business and the continued execution of our business plan:

the acquisition of our current portfolio since July 2014. The team is led by John W. McRoberts, our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors, William C. Harlan, our president and chief operating officer and a member of our board of directors, and Jeffery C. Walraven, our chief financial officer. Each of Messrs. McRoberts and Harlan has over 30 years of experience investing in healthcare real estate and operating companies, having completed over 170 acquisitions of healthcare-related facilities through various investment vehicles. Mr. Walraven has 25 years of experience, including 22 years of public accounting experience, serving many public REIT clients since 1999, including with respect to numerous public and private REIT transactions and offerings. The majority of the Company’s current real estate portfolio is leased pursuant to triple-net lease structures, the Company’s primary leasing structure for direct property investments. We believe this focus on triple-net leases for properties, together with our existing property management systems and management personnel, enables the Company to support a significant increase in the size of our portfolio without a proportionate increase in administrative or management costs.

• | Access to Attractive Off-Market and Target-Marketed Investment Opportunities through Extensive Industry Connections. The Company’s executive management team has long-standing relationships with owners, operators and developers of healthcare properties, who we believe value their industry knowledge and commitment to working in a cooperative and supportive manner. In addition, the executive management team has extensive relationships with private equity groups, attorneys, contractors and commercial bankers who invest in or otherwise support healthcare services operators. Since our formation, each of the properties that we have acquired was sourced through the existing relationships of our management team, and going forward, we believe these relationships will provide us with off-market acquisition and investment opportunities, as well as target-marketed opportunities that are strategically presented to a limited number of capital providers. We believe such off-market and target-marketed transactions may not be available to many of our competitors and provide us with the opportunity to purchase assets outside the competitive bidding process.

• | Experience-Driven Investment Underwriting Process. We believe our management team’s depth of experience in healthcare real estate, operations and finance, including underwriting debt and equity investments in healthcare properties, provides us with unique perspective in underwriting potential investments. Our rigorous investment underwriting process focuses on both real estate and healthcare operations and includes a detailed analysis of the property, including historical and projected cash flow and capital needs, visibility of location, quality of construction and local economic, demographic and regulatory factors, as well as an analysis of the financial strength and experience of the healthcare operator and its management team. We believe our underwriting process supports our ability to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders.

• | Legacy-Free, High-Quality Portfolio with Well-Structured Net Leases, Generating Predictable, Sustainable and Growing Cash Flow. As of December 31, 2016, our property portfolio was comprised of 24 healthcare facilities with a total of 2,345 licensed beds located in Texas, California, Nevada and South Carolina, including 17 skilled nursing facilities, two acute care hospitals, two long-term acute care hospitals, one assisted living facility, one inpatient rehabilitation facility and one medical office building. The single-tenant properties in our portfolio were acquired through transactions originated by us and are subject to new leases negotiated by us. We did not inherit a portfolio of assets or leases negotiated by third parties, which has allowed us to selectively acquire high-quality assets that meet our underwriting standards. The properties in our portfolio primarily are located in attractive markets with favorable demographic trends and, as of December 31, 2016, were approximately 99.0% leased and had a weighted-average remaining lease term of approximately 13.4 years. The properties in our portfolio have an average age of less than 10 years since they were built or underwent a major renovation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The single-tenant properties in our portfolio primarily are leased to high-quality, experienced providers covering the acute and post-acute spectrum of care, are subject to long-term non-cancellable triple-net leases and are supported by parent guarantees, cross-default provisions and/or cross-collateralization provisions. In addition, leases for our single-tenant properties contain rent escalators, which protect us against inflation and potential increases in interest rates. All of the single-tenant facilities in our portfolio also benefit from parent guarantees. As a result, 97% of our total annualized rental income benefits from an additional layer of credit protection by requiring the guarantors to make our tenants’ rental payments to us in the event that a facility on a stand-alone basis cannot generate sufficient cash flow to meet its rental obligations to us. One key advantage of this credit enhancement is that it minimizes our risk associated with the performance of one facility because our rental income is reinforced by the financial performance across a more diversified pool of facilities.
 Our Business and Growth Strategies
 Our primary business objective is to provide our stockholders with stable cash distributions and an opportunity for value enhancement over time through investments in a diversified mix of healthcare properties, coupled with proactive management and prudent financing of our healthcare property investments. Key elements of our strategy include:

Employ a Differentiated Investment Strategy Focused on Multiple Types of Acute and Post-Acute Healthcare Properties
 The market for healthcare real estate is extensive and includes real estate owned by a variety of healthcare operators. We focus on acquiring, financing and otherwise investing in multiple types of acute and post-acute healthcare properties that reflect long-term trends in healthcare delivery methods, which we believe differentiates us from other healthcare real estate investors. We believe that the healthcare industry will continue to evolve and trend towards value- and outcome-based payment models, Managed Medicare, changing patient criteria definitions and shortening length of stays, which we believe will result in an increasing interdependence of acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities and other post-acute facilities. Our investment strategy is tailored to take advantage of the market opportunities created by these changes. We believe that by investing in facilities that span the entire acute and post-acute spectrum of care, we will be able to adapt to, and capitalize on, such changes in the healthcare industry and support, grow and develop long-term relationships with providers that serve the highest number of patients at the highest-yielding end of the healthcare real estate market. Our investment focus is primarily on the following types of healthcare properties:

• | Acute Care Hospitals. Acute care hospitals are general medical and surgical hospitals providing both inpatient and outpatient medical services and are owned and/or operated either by a non-profit or for-profit hospital or hospital system. These facilities often act as feeder hospitals to dedicated specialty facilities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Skilled Nursing Facilities. Skilled nursing facilities provide restorative, rehabilitative and nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at acute care hospitals or long-term acute care hospitals but require higher levels of care than provided in assisted living facilities. Many provide ancillary services that include occupational, speech, physical, respiratory and IV therapies, as well as sub-acute care services.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Dedicated Specialty Acute Care Hospitals. Other dedicated specialty acute care hospitals are medical and surgical hospitals dedicated to specialized services, such as orthopedic hospitals, cardiac hospitals, hospitals and psychiatric hospitals. These hospitals typically are located in urban and suburban areas, and offer their specialized services in a lower cost setting than in a general acute care hospital.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities. Inpatient rehabilitation facilities are hospitals that provide inpatient rehabilitation services for patients recovering from injuries, organ transplants, amputations, cardiovascular surgery, strokes, and complex neurological, orthopedic and other conditions. These hospitals are often the best medical alternative to traditional acute care hospitals, which receive reimbursements based upon diagnostic-related groups and, thus are pressured to discharge patients to lower-cost, post-acute care settings after patients become medically stable.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals. Long-term acute care hospitals are hospitals that focus on extended hospital care for the medically complex patient in lower-cost, more focused settings.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Medical Office Buildings. Medical office buildings are buildings occupied by physician practices located near or adjacent to acute care hospitals or other facilities where healthcare services are rendered. Medical office buildings can be leased by physicians, physician practice groups, hospitals, hospital systems or other healthcare providers and can include outpatient surgical centers, diagnostic labs, physical therapy providers and physician office space in a single building.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ambulatory Surgery Centers. Ambulatory surgery centers are freestanding facilities designed to allow patients to have surgery, spend a short time recovering at the center and then return home to complete their recovery. Ambulatory surgery centers offer a lower cost alternative to general acute care hospitals for many surgical procedures in an environment that is more convenient for both patients and physicians. Procedures commonly performed include those related to dermatology, ear, nose and throat/audiology, pain, ophthalmology, orthopedics and sports health, and urology.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Over the long term, we expect our portfolio to be balanced equally between acute and post-acute facilities, although the balance may fluctuate from time to time due to the impact of individual transactions.
 Utilize Multiple Investment Structures to Maximize Investment Returns
 We intend to continue to utilize multiple investment structures to maximize investment returns, including: healthcare property purchases with triple-net leases back to the operators, first mortgage loans secured by healthcare properties, mezzanine loans secured by ownership interests in entities that own healthcare properties, leasehold mortgages, loans to healthcare operators and equity investments in healthcare operators. In addition, we may provide capital to finance the development of healthcare properties, which may lead to the ultimate acquisition of pre-leased properties. We believe that providing operators and developers with a variety of financing options enhances yield, provides a pathway to additional investments and positions us as a favorable capital partner that can accommodate creative and flexible capital structures.  
Negotiate Well-Structured Net Leases with Strong Coverage
 Our primary ownership structure is a facility purchase with a long-term triple-net lease with the healthcare provider. We intend to continue to negotiate leases that generally have minimum lease coverage ratio requirements (the ratio of the tenant’s earnings 
 5


before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rent (“EBITDAR”) to its annualized base rent) and fixed charge coverage ratio requirements (the ratio of the tenant’s EBITDAR to its annualized fixed charges (rent, interest and current maturities of long-term debt). We believe our coverage ratios achieve the proper balance between maintaining our profitability and providing comfort that our tenants will be able to pay the rent due under our leases. Under our net leases, our tenants will be responsible for all operating costs and expenses related to the property, including maintenance and repair obligations and other required capital expenditures. For single-tenant properties, we also seek to structure our leases with lease terms ranging from 10 to 25 years and rent escalators that provide a steadily growing cash rental stream. We also may enter into lease extensions during the term of the lease in connection with additional acquisitions, reinvestment projects and other opportunities that arise from our close tenant relationships. Our lease structures also are designed to provide us with key credit support for our rents, including, in certain cases, lease deposits, covenants regarding liquidity, minimum working capital and net worth, liens on accounts receivable and other operating assets, and various provisions for cross-default, cross-collateralization and corporate or parent guarantees, when appropriate. We believe these features help insulate us from variability in operator cash flows and enable us to minimize our expenses while we continue to build our portfolio.
 Leverage Existing and Develop New Operator Relationships
 Our management team has long-standing relationships in the healthcare industry through which we have sourced our existing portfolio and properties under evaluation, and we intend to continue to expand our portfolio by leveraging these existing relationships. Many of our operators have demonstrated a desire, as well as the resources, to grow, and we expect our strong relationships with these operators to lead to other acquisition and investment opportunities going forward. In addition, we intend to develop new relationships with healthcare providers and operators in order to diversify our tenant base and reduce our dependence on any single tenant or operator.
Adhere to Rigorous Investment Underwriting Criteria
 We have adopted a rigorous investment underwriting process based on extensive analysis and due diligence with respect to both the healthcare real estate and the healthcare service operations. We seek to make investments in healthcare properties that have the following attributes: well-located, visible to traffic, in good physical condition with predictable future capital improvement needs and with a profitable operating history or, if a new or non-stabilized facility, a viable and supportable projection of profitability, a well-qualified and experienced operator or guarantor with a good credit history, and located in a market with economic, demographic and regulatory trends that we believe support increasing facility revenues. 
Actively Monitor the Performance of Our Facilities and Industry Trends
 We actively monitor the financial and operational performance of our tenants and lease guarantors and of the specific facilities in which we invest through a variety of methods, such as reviews of periodic financial statements, operating data and clinical outcomes data, regular meetings with the facility management teams and joint strategic planning with the facility operators. Integral to our asset management philosophy is our desire to continue our existing, and develop new, long-term relationships with our tenants so that they view us as a valuable partner and member of their teams. The value of our investments depends, in part, on our tenants’ ability to prosper. Therefore, pursuant to the terms of our leases, our tenants are required to provide us with certain periodic financial statements and operating data, and, during the terms of such leases, we conduct joint evaluations of local facility operations and participate in discussions about strategic plans that may ultimately require our approval pursuant to the terms of our lease agreements. Our management team also communicates regularly with their counterparts at our tenants, and others who closely follow the healthcare industry, in order to maintain knowledge about changing regulatory and business conditions. We believe this knowledge, combined with our management team’s experience in the healthcare industry, allows us to anticipate changes in our tenants’ operations in sufficient time to strategically and financially plan for changing economic, market and regulatory conditions.
 Our ability to effectively implement our business and growth strategies is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Growth Strategy.”
 Our Portfolio
 As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio was comprised of 24 healthcare facilities that contain a total of 2,345 licensed beds. Our properties, which we acquired for an aggregate gross purchase price of $498.9 million, are located in Texas, California, Nevada and South Carolina. We own 100% of all of our properties, other than Lakeway Regional Medical Center (“Lakeway Hospital”), in which we own a 51% interest through our consolidated partnership that owns Lakeway Hospital (the “Lakeway Partnership”). Our single-tenant properties are leased to five operators with experienced management teams, with no single tenant/guarantor representing more than 28.8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, we had a $10.0 million mortgage note receivable as of December 31, 2016.
 Overall payor mix for the single-tenant operating properties in our portfolio, excluding Lakeway Hospital, was composed of approximately 39% Medicare, 27% Medicaid, 24% commercial payors and 10% other payors for the year ended December 31, 2015

2017 Investment
 On January 30, 2017, we invested $12.5 million in an acute care surgical hospital in Houston, Texas in a newly originated interest-only loan with an interest rate of 9.6% and secured by a first mortgage on Advanced Diagnostics Hospital East a licensed general acute care hospital that consists of 23,300 square feet with four operating rooms, two special procedure rooms, four inpatient rooms and four full-size extended recovery rooms. Beginning on October 1, 2017, we will have the exclusive option to purchase the hospital for $12.5 million. The interest-only loan matures on February 1, 2018, with automatic extension until September 30, 2019 if we do not exercise our purchase option prior to maturity.
Property Under Evaluation
 On February 1, 2016, we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of GruenePointe Holdings, LLC (“GruenePointe”) to acquire, at our option and upon completion, a facility located in Dallas, Texas that is currently under development, for a gross purchase price not to exceed approximately $28.0 million, plus an earn-out that we may pay to GruenePointe based on the facility’s EBITDAR during the three years following the closing date of the acquisition. The facility, which is being developed by GruenePointe, is expected to be comprised of an 80-bed skilled nursing facility and 29-bed assisted living facility and is expected to be completed and operational in the third quarter of 2017. If we exercise our right to acquire the facility, we will lease the facility to an affiliate of GruenePointe pursuant to a long-term triple-net lease. The closing of this acquisition is subject to, among other things, GruenePointe’s successful completion of the facility and our ability to obtain equity or debt financing for the acquisition in such amounts and on such terms as are satisfactory to us, in our sole discretion. There can be no assurance that we will ultimately complete the acquisition on the terms currently anticipated, or at all.
Description of Significant Properties
 Texas SNF Portfolio
 On July 30, 2015, we acquired nine skilled nursing facilities for an aggregate gross purchase price of $133.4 million, and on October 2, 2015, we acquired Graham Oaks for a gross purchase price of $11.6 million, which we refer to collectively as the Texas SNF Portfolio. The Texas SNF Portfolio contains an aggregate of approximately 339,733 square feet and 1,145 licensed beds.
 Upon the closing of the acquisitions, we leased 100% of the Texas SNF Portfolio to wholly owned subsidiaries of GruenePointe, pursuant to a triple-net master lease with the tenant responsible for all costs of the facilities, including taxes, utilities, insurance, maintenance and capital improvements. The master lease has a non-cancelable 15-year term, with two five-year extension options. The initial annual base rent under the master lease was approximately $12.3 million, or 8.5% of the $145.0 million aggregate gross purchase price. The annual base rent increases each year by 2.0% of the prior year’s base rent. In addition to the base rent, commencing in the second year of the lease, the master lease provides for additional rent equal to 20% of the amount by which the aggregate gross patient care revenues (i.e., gross revenues less supplemental management fees) of four facilities (Songbird Lodge, Graham Oaks, River City Care Center and Kerens Care Center) exceed the aggregate gross patient care revenues of such facilities in the first year of the lease, until the aggregate rent under the master lease for these four facilities equals 10.0% of the gross purchase 
 11


price allocated to these facilities, subject to increases pursuant to the annual rent escalator. An affiliate of OnPointe Health, which is one of the owners of GruenePointe, manages the operations of the facilities in the Texas SNF Portfolio. 
 The master lease is unconditionally guaranteed by GruenePointe and is guaranteed by an affiliate of OnPointe Health in an amount up to one year’s management fee from the Texas SNF Portfolio and by certain members of GruenePointe up to $6.0 million. The GruenePointe guaranty is cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with all other obligations of GruenePointe to us. In addition, the master lease is secured by (i) a first priority pledge of and security interest in the equity interests in each of the single-asset holding subsidiaries of GruenePointe subject to the master lease and (ii) an assignment and pledge of substantially all of the assets of the single-asset holding subsidiaries of GruenePointe subject to the master lease. 
 Life Generations Portfolio 
 On March 31, 2015, we acquired a portfolio of four skilled nursing facilities and one connected assisted living facility from Life Generations for $80.0 million, and on October 1, 2015, we acquired Kearny Mesa for $15.0 million. We refer to these six facilities collectively as the Life Generations Portfolio. The Life Generations Portfolio is located in the southern California markets and has approximately 559 licensed beds as of December 31, 2016.
 Upon the closing of the acquisitions, we leased 100% of the Life Generations Portfolio to wholly owned subsidiaries of Life Generations pursuant to a triple-net master lease agreement, with the tenants responsible for all costs of the facilities, including taxes, insurance, maintenance and capital improvements. The lease has a non-cancelable 15-year term, with two five-year extension options. The initial annual base rent under the lease was approximately $8.3 million, or 8.75% of the $95.0 million aggregate gross purchase price. On the fifth anniversary of the initial lease term, the annual base rent will increase by the lesser 2.0% and the percentage increase in the consumer price index over the first five years of the lease. On the sixth through the ninth anniversaries of the initial lease term, the annual base rent will increase each year by the lesser of 2.0% and the percentage increase in the consumer price index over the prior 12 months. On each anniversary thereafter, the annual base rent will increase by 2.5% of the prior year’s base rent. 
 The master lease agreement is unconditionally guaranteed by Life Generations. The master lease is also cross-defaulted with (i) any material uncured default by Life Generations under its credit facility that results in the actual acceleration of any amounts outstanding under its credit facility and (ii) any material uncured default under any material obligations related to the Life Generations Portfolio. 
 Lakeway Hospital 
 Lakeway Hospital is a 270,512 square-foot acute care hospital located in Lakeway, Texas. The hospital opened in April 2012 and is licensed for 106 beds and has six operating rooms. 
 We own the facility through the Lakeway Partnership, which, based on a total equity contribution of $2.0 million, is owned 51% by us and 49% by an entity that is owned indirectly by physicians who have relocated their practices to Lakeway Hospital and a non-physician investor. Our equity contribution to the Lakeway Partnership was $1.0 million, and our transfer of the original $50.0 million note and $23.0 million of cash to the Lakeway Partnership is structured as the Lakeway Intercompany Mortgage Loan to the Lakeway Partnership that is secured by a first mortgage lien on Lakeway Hospital. The Lakeway Intercompany Mortgage Loan has a ten-year term and requires payments of principal and interest at a rate of 8.0% per annum based on a 25-year amortization schedule. The interest rate on the Lakeway Intercompany Mortgage Loan will reset after five years based upon then-current market rates. The Lakeway Intercompany Mortgage Loan, the related interest income to us and the related interest expense to the Lakeway Partnership are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. 
 In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Lakeway Hospital, we assumed the seller’s rights as lessor under the ground lease for the medical office building that is part of Lakeway Hospital. The ground lease expires on October 1, 2061, subject to two ten-year extension options, and provides for annual base rent to the Lakeway Partnership of approximately $0.2 million, which will increase each year by 3.0% of the prior year’s base rent. 
 Prior to September 1, 2016 we leased Lakeway Hospital to LRMC pursuant to a triple-net lease, with the tenant responsible for all costs of the facility, including taxes, utilities, insurance, maintenance and capital improvements. The lease had a non-cancelable 25-year term, with two ten-year extension options. The stabilized annualized base rent payable to the Lakeway Partnership under the lease was approximately $12.8 million payable in equal monthly installments. The contractual base rent increased ratably during the first six months of 2016 by an aggregate of $3.5 million (representing the difference between the reduced monthly base rent of $0.5 million due for the second and third quarters of 2015 and the stabilized monthly rent of $1.1 million, plus interest on the deferred rent), which we refer to as the Deferred Lakeway Payment. In connection with the Lakeway Hospital operator change to BSW Health, we agreed to receive $1.5 million in satisfaction of the $1.7 million in the Deferred Lakeway Payment due as of March 31, 2016 and to waive the remaining $1.8 million of the Deferred Lakeway Payment. 
 On September 1, 2016, BSW Health acquired the operations of LRMC. In connection with the closing of this transaction, we simultaneously terminated the lease with LRMC and entered into a new triple-net lease with the Baylor Lessee, which has an initial term of 15 years with two ten-year extension options. The initial annual base rent under the lease is approximately $12.8 million, 
 12


payable in equal monthly installments, which is the same as the stabilized annual base rent under the prior lease. The base rent will increase by 1.75% on the second anniversary of the lease, 2.0% on the third anniversary and 2.5% on each anniversary thereafter. Under the lease, we agreed to provide the Baylor Lessee an approximately $2.3 million tenant allowance for the transition of the hospital within 30 days of executing the lease. 
 The lease provides that, commencing after completion of the third year of the lease and subject to certain conditions, the Baylor Lessee has the option to purchase Lakeway Hospital at a price equal to the aggregate base rent payable under the lease for the 12-month period following the date of the written notice from the Baylor Lessee divided by (i) 6.5% if written notice is provided after completion of the third lease year and before completion of the tenth lease year (which would result in a purchase price of not less than approximately $203.6 million) or (ii) 7.0% if written notice is provided any time thereafter. In addition, the Baylor Lessee has a right of first refusal and a right of first offer in the event that we intend to sell or otherwise transfer Lakeway Hospital. The lease is unconditionally guaranteed by BUMC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the nonprofit parent corporation Baylor Scott & White Holdings. 
 Kentfield Rehabilitation & Specialty Hospital 
 Kentfield Rehabilitation & Specialty Hospital (“Kentfield Hospital”), is a 40,091 square-foot long-term acute care hospital located in Kentfield, California that consists of approximately 29,000 square-feet with 60 licensed long-term acute care hospital beds and an approximately 11,000 square-foot adjoining medical office building. Kentfield Hospital is leased to a subsidiary of Vibra Healthcare pursuant to a triple-net lease effective August 1, 2014, with the tenant responsible for all costs of the facility, including taxes, utilities, insurance, maintenance and capital improvements. The lease has a 15-year term with two five-year extension options. The lease was amended on October 27, 2016 to extend the term to December 31, 2031 and increase the annual base rent to approximately $5.3 million effective December 1, 2016. The annual base rent will increase each year by the percentage by which the consumer price index has increased over the prior 12 months, subject to an annual cap of 2.0% of the prior year’s base rent beginning in August 2017. 
 The lease is unconditionally guaranteed by each of Vibra Healthcare and Vibra Healthcare II, LLC, or Vibra Healthcare II. In addition, the lease is secured by an assignment and pledge of substantially all of the assets, other than accounts receivable, of Kentfield Hospital, subject to the terms of an intercreditor agreement between us and the tenants existing lender. The obligations of the tenant and of Vibra Healthcare and Vibra Healthcare II as guarantors is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the obligations and all collateral, if any, securing any existing and future obligations of the tenant, Vibra Healthcare, Vibra Healthcare II and their respective affiliates to us, including the Vibra Mortgage Loan. 
 Our Tax Status 
 We elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. Our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT will depend upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our stock. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and that our intended manner of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Under the Code, REITs are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that they distribute on an annual basis at least 90% of their REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains. If we fail to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates, and we would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Even if we maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to state and local taxes on our income and assets and to U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. Additionally, any income earned by MedEquities Realty TRS, LLC our taxable REIT subsidiary, and any other taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”) that we form or acquire in the future will be fully subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income tax.
 Competition
 The market for making investments in healthcare properties is highly competitive and fragmented, and increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our investment objectives. In acquiring and leasing healthcare properties and providing financing to healthcare operators, we compete with financial institutions, institutional pension funds, private equity funds, real estate developers, other REITs, other public and private real estate companies and private real estate investors, many of whom have greater financial and operational resources and lower costs of capital than we 
 13


have. We also face competition in leasing or subleasing available facilities to prospective tenants and entering into operating agreements with prospective operators.
 Our tenants/operators compete on a local and regional basis with operators of facilities that provide comparable services. The basis of competition for our operators includes the quality of care provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility, price, the range of services offered, family preference, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral sources, location and the size and demographics of the population and surrounding areas.
 Regulation 
 Healthcare Regulatory Matters
 The following discussion describes certain material healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our operations and those of our tenants/operators. The ownership and operation of hospitals, other healthcare properties and other healthcare providers are subject to extensive federal, state and local government healthcare laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include requirements related to licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition or expansion of facilities and services, prices for services, billing for services and the confidentiality and security of health-related information. Different properties within our portfolio may be more or less subject to certain types of regulation, some of which are specific to the type of facility or provider. These laws and regulations are wide-ranging and complex, may vary or overlap from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject frequently to change. Compliance with these regulatory requirements can increase operating costs and, thereby, adversely affect the financial viability of our tenants/operators’ businesses. Our tenants/operators’ failure to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect their ability to successfully operate our properties, which could negatively impact their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations to us. Our leases will require the tenants/operators to comply with all applicable laws, including healthcare laws.
 We may be subject directly to healthcare laws and regulations, because of the broad nature of some of these restrictions, such as the Anti-kickback Statute, among others. In some cases, especially in the event we own properties managed by third parties, regulatory authorities could classify us or our subsidiaries as an operating entity or license holder. Such a designation would significantly increase the regulatory requirements directly applicable to us and subject us to increased regulatory risk. We intend for all of our business activities and operations to conform in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, including healthcare laws and regulations. We expect that the healthcare industry will continue to face increased regulations and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, healthcare management and provision of services.
 Healthcare Reform Measures. The Affordable Care Act has changed how healthcare services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of uninsured individuals, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (“DSH”) payments, and expanding efforts to tie reimbursement to quality and efficiency. In addition, the law reforms certain aspects of health insurance, contains provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement, and encourages the development of new payment models, including the creation of Accountable Care Organizations (“ACOs”). On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court struck down the portion of the Affordable Care Act that would have allowed HHS to penalize states that do not implement the law’s Medicaid expansion provisions with the loss of existing federal Medicaid funding. As a result, some states may choose not to implement the Medicaid expansion.
 The expansion of health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act may result in a material increase in the number of patients using our tenants/operator’s facilities who have either private or public program coverage. In addition, the creation of ACOs and related initiatives may create possible sources of additional revenue. However, our tenants/operators may be negatively impacted by the law’s payment reductions, and it is uncertain what reimbursement rates will apply to coverage purchased through the exchanges. It is difficult to predict the full impact of the Affordable Care Act due to the law’s complexity, limited implementing regulations or interpretive guidance, gradual and potentially delayed implementation, court challenges and possible amendment or repeal, as well as our inability to foresee how individuals, states and businesses will respond to the choices afforded them by the law.
 Sources of Revenue and Reimbursement. Our tenants and operators will receive payments for patient services from the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans, private insurers and directly from patients. Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons, persons with end-stage renal disease and persons with Lou Gehrig’s Disease. Medicaid is a federal-state program, administered by the states, which provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford healthcare. Generally, revenues for services rendered to Medicare patients are determined under a prospective payment system (“PPS”). CMS annually establishes payment rates for the PPS for each applicable facility type.
 Amounts received under Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than established facility gross charges for the services provided and may not reflect the provider’s costs. Healthcare providers generally offer discounts from established charges to certain group purchasers of healthcare services, including private insurance companies, employers, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”) and other managed care plans. These discount programs generally limit a provider’s ability to increase revenues in response to increasing costs. Patients are generally not responsible for the 
 14


total difference between established provider gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles or coinsurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and coinsurance continues to increase. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or third-party payers.
 Payments to providers are being increasingly tied to quality and efficiency. These initiatives include requirements to report clinical data and patient satisfaction scores, reduced Medicare payments to hospitals based on “excess” readmission rates as determined by CMS, denial of payments under Medicare, Medicaid and some private payors for services resulting from a hospital or facility-acquired condition (“HAC”), and reduced Medicare payments to hospitals with high risk-adjusted HAC rates. Certain provider types, including, but not limited to, inpatient rehabilitation facilities and long-term acute care hospitals, are subject to specific limits and restrictions on admissions which, in turn, affect reimbursement at these facilities.
 The amounts of program payments received by our tenants/operators can be changed from time to time by legislative or regulatory actions and by determinations by agents for the programs. The Medicare and Medicaid statutory framework is subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and discretion that affect the amount and timing of reimbursement made under Medicare and Medicaid. Federal healthcare program reimbursement changes may be applied retroactively under certain circumstances. In recent years, the federal government has enacted various measures to reduce spending under federal healthcare programs including required cuts under the Affordable Care Act and “sequestration” reductions as required by the Budget Control Act of 2011. In addition, many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, measures designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures and change private healthcare insurance, and states continue to face significant challenges in maintaining appropriate levels of Medicaid funding due to state budget shortfalls. Further, non-government payers may reduce their reimbursement rates in accordance with payment reductions by government programs or for other reasons. Healthcare provider operating margins may continue to be under significant pressure due to the deterioration in pricing flexibility and payor mix, as well as increases in operating expenses that exceed increases in payments under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 Anti-Kickback Statute. A section of the Social Security Act known as the “Anti-kickback Statute” prohibits, among other things, the offer, payment, solicitation or acceptance of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for referring an individual to a provider of services for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program, including the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and held that the Anti-kickback Statute is violated if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. The Affordable Care Act provides that knowledge of the Anti-kickback Statute or specific intent to violate the statute is not required in order to violate the Anti-kickback Statute. Violation of the Anti-kickback Statute is a crime, punishable by fines of up to $25,000 per violation, five years imprisonment, or both. Violations may also result in civil and administrative liability and sanctions, including civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation, liability under the False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and additional monetary penalties in amounts treble to the underlying remuneration.
 There are a limited number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors for categories of activities deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. Currently, there are statutory exceptions and safe harbors for various activities, including the following: certain investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, managed care arrangements, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, ambulance replenishing and referral agreements for specialty services. The safe harbor for space rental arrangements requires, among other things, that the aggregate rental payments be set in advance, be consistent with fair market value and not be determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals. The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor does not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the Anti-kickback Statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.
 Many states have laws similar to the Anti-kickback Statute that regulate the exchange of remuneration in connection with the provision of healthcare services, including prohibiting payments to physicians for patient referrals. The scope of these state laws is broad because they can often apply regardless of the source of payment for care. Little precedent exists for their interpretation or enforcement. These statutes typically provide for criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of facility licensure.
 We intend to use commercially reasonable efforts to structure our arrangements, including any lease/operating arrangements involving facilities in which local physicians are investors, so as to satisfy, or meet as closely as possible, safe harbor requirements. The safe harbors are narrowly structured, and there are not safe harbors available for every type of financial arrangement that we or our tenants/operators may enter. Although it is our intention to fully comply with the Anti-kickback Statue, as well as all other applicable state and federal laws, we cannot assure you that all of our arrangements or the arrangements of our tenants/operators will meet all the conditions for a safe harbor. There can be no assurance regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine our financial arrangements or the financial relationships of our tenants/operators comply with the Anti-kickback Statute or other similar laws.
 Stark Law. The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” The Stark Law prohibits a physician from making a referral to an entity furnishing “designated health services” paid by Medicare or Medicaid if the physician or 
 15


a member of the physician’s immediate family has a financial relationship with that entity. Designated health services include, among other services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, clinical laboratory services, physical therapy services and radiology services. The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated health services from billing the Medicare and Medicaid programs for any items or services that result from a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the prohibited referral. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per prohibited service provided for failure to return amounts received in a timely manner, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The statute also provides for a penalty of up to $100,000 for a circumvention scheme. Failure to refund amounts received pursuant to a prohibited referral may also constitute a false claim and result in additional penalties under the False Claims Act, which is discussed in greater detail below.
 There are exceptions to the self-referral prohibition for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. There is also an exception for a physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital, as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute, an arrangement must comply with every requirement of a Stark Law exception, or the arrangement will be in violation of the Stark Law. Through a series of rulemakings, CMS has issued final regulations implementing the Stark Law. While these regulations were intended to clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, it is unclear how the government will interpret many of these exceptions for enforcement purposes.
 Although there is an exception for a physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital, the Affordable Care Act prohibits newly created physician-owned hospitals from billing for Medicare patients referred by their physician owners. As a result, the law effectively prevents the formation after December 31, 2010 of new physician-owned hospitals that participate in Medicare and Medicaid. While the Affordable Care Act grandfathers existing physician-owned hospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of physician ownership and significantly restricts their ability to expand services.
 Many states also have laws similar to the Stark Law that prohibit certain self-referrals. The scope of these state laws is broad because they can often apply regardless of the source of payment for care, and little precedent exists for their interpretation or enforcement. These statutes typically provide for criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of facility licensure.
 Although our lease agreements will require lessees to comply with the Stark Law, we cannot offer assurance that the arrangements entered into by us or by our tenants/operators will be found to be in compliance with the Stark Law or similar state laws.
 The False Claims Act. The federal False Claims Act prohibits knowingly making or presenting any false claim for payment to the federal government. The government may use the False Claims Act to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud in areas such as coding errors, billing for services not provided, submitting false cost reports and failing to report and repay an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later. The False Claims Act defines the term “knowingly” broadly. Though simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the False Claims Act, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity constitutes a “knowing” submission.
 The False Claims Act contains qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions that allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. Whistleblowers under the False Claims Act may collect a portion of the government’s recovery. Every entity that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for all employees, contractors or agents, providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including the False Claims Act, and similar state laws.
 In some cases, whistleblowers and the federal government have taken the position, and some courts have held, that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Anti-kickback Statute and the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the False Claims Act. The Affordable Care Act clarifies this issue with respect to the Anti-kickback Statute by providing that submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the False Claims Act. If a defendant is found liable under the False Claims Act, the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, additional civil penalties of up to $21,562.80 per false claim, plus reimbursement of the fees of counsel for the whistleblower.
 Many states have enacted similar statutes preventing the presentation of a false claim to a state government, and we expect more to do so because the Social Security Act provides a financial incentive for states to enact statutes establishing state level liability.

Other Fraud & Abuse Laws. There are various other fraud and abuse laws at both the federal and state levels that cover false claims and false statements and these may impact our business. For example, the Civil Monetary Penalties law authorizes the imposition of monetary penalties against an entity that engages in a number of prohibited activities. The penalties vary by the prohibited conduct, but include penalties of $10,000 for each item or service, $15,000 for each individual with respect to whom false or misleading information was given, and treble damages for the total amount of remuneration claimed. The prohibited actions include, but are not limited to, the following:
  
• | knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, a claim for services not provided as claimed or which is otherwise false or fraudulent in any way;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | knowingly giving or causing to be giving false or misleading information reasonably expected to influence the decision to discharge a patient;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | offering or giving remuneration to any beneficiary of a federal healthcare program likely to influence the receipt of reimbursable items or services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | arranging for reimbursable services with an entity which is excluded from participation from a federal healthcare program; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | knowingly or willfully soliciting or receiving remuneration for a referral of a federal healthcare program beneficiary.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Any violations of the Civil Monetary Penalties Law by management or our tenants/operators could result in substantial fines and penalties, and could have an adverse effect on our business.
 HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements. HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations create a national standard for protecting the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information (called “protected health information”). Compliance with HIPAA is mandatory for covered entities, which include healthcare providers such as tenants/operators of our facilities. Compliance is also required for entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information on behalf of covered entities, such as healthcare providers or that perform services for such covered entities that involve the disclosure of protected health information, called “business associates.” In January, 2013, HHS issued a final rule to implement regulations pursuant to the HITECH Act and also imposed certain additional obligations for covered entities and their business associates. The final rule became effective March 26, 2013, and covered entities and business associates have until September 23, 2013 to comply with most of these provisions. On September 19, 2013, HHS’s Office for Civil Rights announced a delay in the enforcement, until further notice, of the requirement that certain HIPAA—covered laboratories revise their notices of privacy practices to comply with certain provisions of HIPAA and the HITECH Act. In announcing the enforcement delay, HHS indicated that the Office for Civil Rights will issue a public notice at least 30 days in advance of the end of this enforcement delay. HHS previously had announced other enforcement delays under HIPAA and may, in the future, announce additional guidance that could affect the business of our tenants/operators subject to these laws.
 Covered entities must report a breach of protected health information that has not been secured through encryption or rendered unusable, unreadable or indecipherable to unauthorized third parties to all affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but in any case no more than 60 days after the breach is discovered. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in the case of a breach involving more than 500 individuals, to the media. In the final rule issued in January, 2013, HHS modified the standard for determining whether a breach has occurred by creating a presumption that any non-permitted acquisition, access, use or disclosure of protected health information is a breach unless the covered entity or business associate can demonstrate that there is a low probability that the information has been compromised, based on a risk assessment.
 Covered entities and business associates are subject to civil penalties for violations of HIPAA of up to $1.5 million per year for violations of the same requirement. In addition, criminal penalties can be imposed not only against covered entities and business associates, but also against individual employees who obtain or disclose protected health information without authorization. The criminal penalties range up to $250,000 and up to 10 years imprisonment. In addition, state Attorneys General may bring civil actions predicated on HIPAA violations, HHS must conduct periodic HIPAA compliance audits of covered entities and business associates. If any of our tenants/operators are subject to an investigation or audit and found to be in violation of HIPAA, such tenants/operators could incur substantial penalties, which could have a negative impact on their financial condition. Our tenants/operators may also be subject to more stringent state law privacy, security and breach notification obligations.
 Licensure, Certification and Accreditation. Healthcare property construction and operation are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations relating to the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate records, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for our tenants/operators to make changes in their facilities, equipment, personnel and services.
 Facilities in our portfolio will be subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for licensing and accreditation. We will require our healthcare properties to be properly licensed under applicable state laws. Except for provider types not eligible for participation in Medicare and Medicaid, we 
 17


expect our operators/facilities to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and, where applicable, to be accredited by an approved accrediting organization. The loss of Medicare or Medicaid certification would result in our tenants/operators that operate Medicare/Medicaid-eligible providers from receiving reimbursement from federal healthcare programs. The loss of accreditation, where applicable, would result in increased scrutiny by CMS and likely the loss of payment from non-government payers.
 In some states, the construction or expansion of healthcare properties, the acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer or change of ownership and the addition of new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior approval of, or notifications to, state regulatory agencies under a Certificate of Need (“CON”) program. Such laws generally require the reviewing state agency to determine the public need for additional or expanded healthcare properties and services. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation also include notification or approval in the event of the transfer or change of ownership or certain other changes. Further, federal programs, including Medicare, must be notified in the event of a change of ownership or change of information at a participating provider. Failure by our tenants/operators to provide required federal and state notifications, obtain necessary state licensure and CON approvals could result in significant penalties as well as prevent the completion of an acquisition or effort to expand services or facilities. We may be required to provide ownership information or otherwise participate in certain of these approvals and notifications.
 EMTALA. The EMTALA is a federal law that requires any hospital participating in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every individual who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. The government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which individuals do not actually present to a hospital’s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions.
 Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program. In addition, an injured individual, the individual’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of a hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital. Our leases will require any hospitals in our portfolio operate in compliance with EMTALA, but failure to comply could result in substantial fines and penalties.
 Antitrust Laws. The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, concerted refusal to deal, market allocation, monopolization, attempts to monopolize, price discrimination, tying arrangements, exclusive dealing, acquisitions of competitors and other practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the healthcare industry is currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. We intend to operate so that we and our tenants/operators are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but future review by courts or regulatory authorities could result in a determination that could adversely affect the operations of our tenants/operators and, consequently, our operations.
 Healthcare Industry Investigations. Significant media and public attention has focused in recent years on the healthcare industry. The federal government is dedicated to funding additional federal enforcement activities related to healthcare providers and preventing fraud and abuse. Our tenants/operators will engage in many of routine healthcare operations and other activities that could be the subject of governmental investigations or inquiries. For example, our tenants/operators will likely have significant Medicare and Medicaid billings, numerous financial arrangements with physicians who are referral sources, and joint venture arrangements involving physician investors. In recent years, Congress has increased the level of funding for fraud and abuse enforcement activities. It is possible that governmental entities could initiate investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant costs and penalties, as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible that our executives could be included in governmental investigations or litigation or named as defendants in private litigation.
 Governmental agencies and their agents, such as the Medicare Administrative Contractors, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, as well as the HHS-OIG and HHS-OCR, CMS and state Medicaid programs, may conduct audits of our tenants/operator’s operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and our tenants/operators may also perform internal audits and monitoring. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have a material, adverse effect on our portfolio’s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
 Under the Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) program, CMS contracts with RACs on a contingency basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the fee-for-service Medicare program, to managed Medicare plans and in the Medicaid program. CMS has also initiated a RAC prepayment demonstration program in 11 states. CMS also employs Medicaid Integrity Contractors (“MICs”) to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. In addition to RACs and MICs, the state Medicaid agencies and other contractors have increased their review activities. Should any of our tenants/operators be found out of compliance with any of these laws, regulations or programs, our business, our financial position and our results of operations could be negatively impacted.

Environmental Matters 
 A wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare property operations. These complex federal and state statutes, and their enforcement, involve a myriad of regulations, many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender. Some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property or a secured lender, such as us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s or secured lender’s liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property, and/or the assets of the owner or secured lender. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, could reduce our revenues. For a description of the risks associated with environmental matters, see the risk factors described in Item 1A herein. 
Insurance 
 We have general liability insurance (lessor’s risk) that provides coverage for bodily injury and property damage to third parties resulting from our ownership of the healthcare properties that are leased to and occupied by our tenants. For our single-tenant properties, our leases with tenants also require the tenants to carry general liability, professional liability, all risks, loss of earnings and other insurance coverages and to name us as an additional insured under these policies. We believe that the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. 
Employees
 At December 31, 2016, we had 11 employees.
