Item 1. Business 
Company Overview 
Our mission is to help people navigate and truly enjoy life’s biggest moments together. Our multi-platform brands guide couples through transformative life stages - from getting married with The Knot, to having a baby with The Bump, and helping bring important celebrations to life with entertainment vendors from GigMasters.
The Knot. The Knot is the nation’s leading wedding resource and marketplace that seamlessly engages, matches, and connects couples with the right products, services, and local wedding professionals they need to plan their wedding. We believe that The Knot, as the flagship brand of XO Group, reaches a majority of couples getting married in the U.S. through the #1 wedding website, TheKnot.com, its mobile apps, national and local wedding magazines, and nationally published books. Based on ComScore data, The Knot generates more unique visitors than the next six largest wedding websites combined. In 2017, The Knot Wedding Planner app for Apple and Android devices was downloaded more than 1 million times, and at times has been ranked in the top 50 lifestyle apps in the Apple app store. 
The Bump. The Bump is a leading pregnancy and parenting brand, providing personalized information, content, and tools for navigating the journey from fertility to pregnancy and parenting through the toddler years. The Bump reaches millions of expectant and new parents across its seamless app and web experience. 
GigMasters. GigMasters.com (“GigMasters”) is a leading event marketplace for finding and booking the perfect entertainment and vendors for birthday parties, weddings, anniversaries, corporate events and more. Combining the efficiency of the web with the personal touch of a private event planner, GigMasters features approximately 40,000 of the best, client-reviewed entertainers and event vendors in the U.S. and Canada. 
Our Largest Market Opportunity 
The U.S. wedding market is large and highly fragmented. We estimate there are hundreds of thousands of local wedding professionals serving couples in the U.S. who generate over $50 billion of total annual spend. Additionally, based on our research, wedding guests give approximately 150 million gifts valued at more than $10 billion to marrying couples each year. 
Despite the size of this market, there has been no proven and efficient way for couples and guests to connect with relevant partners. As leaders in the weddings space, we believe we are uniquely positioned to help couples better connect with local wedding vendors and guests find and purchase the right gift. If we are able to capitalize on this opportunity, we will be able to capture more of the marketing spend by local wedding vendors and more of the commission payments paid by our retail and commerce partners.
Services 
We offer multiplatform media and marketplace services that enable our advertising and transaction partners to connect with our highly engaged audience in the wedding, pregnancy and parenting, and local entertainment markets. We reach our audience through several platforms, including websites, mobile apps, magazines and books, television, and video.
We create value for our audience, advertisers, and partners by delivering relevant and personalized solutions at key decision making moments for some of life’s proudest and happiest events. We generate revenue through four distinct and diversified products:
Local Online Advertising. Our local programs include, but are not limited to, (i) online listings, (ii) digital advertisements, and (iii) direct e-mail marketing. At December 31, 2017, TheKnot.com hosted over 264,500 free local storefront listings in more than 83 local markets highlighting offerings for over 44 categories of wedding planning services. On a trailing twelve month basis, TheKnot.com ended 2017 with more than 27,200 paying vendors, spending an average of $2,995 per year. In addition to TheKnot.com paid storefront listings, local online advertising revenue includes listings revenue generated via

GigMasters.com, an entertainment marketplace, and TwoBrightLights.com, a wedding photography syndication marketplace. In 2017, local online advertising represented 49% of our consolidated revenue.
National Online Advertising. Online programs include, but are not limited to, (i) display advertisements, (ii) custom and brand-integrated content, and (iii) lead generation marketing, including direct e-mails. In 2017, national online advertising represented 23% of our consolidated revenue.
Transactions. Our transaction offerings include a registry service that enables users to create, manage, and share multiple retail store registries from a single source, and retailer and other vendor offerings such as invitations, stationery, reception decor, and personalized gifts. Through our GigMasters.com website, our audience has the opportunity to find, research, and book the right entertainment vendor for them. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, or some combination thereof with respect to these transactions. In 2017, transaction revenue represented 17% of our consolidated revenue and was our fastest growing revenue stream.
Publishing and Other. We publish traditional magazines for our flagship brand, The Knot. The Knot publishes a national magazine four times a year, and a regional magazine semi-annually in 16 U.S. markets. Each magazine provides original, expert-driven content in our signature voice, driving readers back to our digital assets for an interactive experience and additional connections and services. In 2017, publishing and other represented 11% of our consolidated revenue.
Strategy 
At XO, we help people navigate and enjoy life's biggest moments together. We create value for our audience, partners, and stockholders by building and scaling two-sided marketplaces that bring together people who are planning their most important life events and the business partners who serve them, making it easy for them to connect and transact.
We attract our audience, which is largely women, by providing them with an indispensable and personalized planning experience.
We attract business partners, ranging from local wedding professionals to large-cap, publicly traded companies, by connecting them to a highly qualified customer base and helping them transact.
We believe our position as a market leader in the wedding space, our best-in-class products, our talented team, and an unwavering commitment to continue to improve, puts us in an advantaged position to continue to create more value for our users, partners, and stockholders.
In order to capitalize on our opportunity, we are pursuing the following strategy, which has been approved by our Board of Directors.

• | Focus on our customers' individual planning experiences: Our 20 year history of serving couples has positioned us well to understand the needs of a large variety of users. From that, we have created a platform that can provide a unique planning experience for every user. By focusing on each couple's special journey, we will continue to increase engagement between our couples and business partners, providing both with increasing value.


• | Deliver the world's best local wedding marketplace: Our marketplace products provide our local wedding professionals with marketing services that help them build and grow their businesses. We plan to launch more features that unlock more sales inventory, increase quality leads, and provide our pros with improved marketing opportunities.


• | Increase transaction revenue: We will continue the growth of our transaction revenue by offering industry-leading wedding websites and registry creation and aggregation tools for couples, while making it easy for guests to purchase gifts for the couple. We will also continue to integrate revenue-generating third-party products and services to facilitate our couples' wedding planning, including invitations, reception decor, hotel room blocks, and more.


• | Manage national online advertising and publishing for profit: We will profitably manage our national online and print businesses through the challenges of industry declines while continuing to look for creative new products to offer our advertising partners.

• | Invest for the future while pursuing a measured capital allocation strategy: We operate in an ever-evolving industry. In order to ensure we are even more relevant and competitive, we will continue to invest in initiatives that complement our existing business and enhance the experience of our couples, guests, local professionals and partners, which we believe will drive significant results in future years. Our capital allocation strategy is to balance internal investments, strategic investments, mergers and acquisitions, and stock repurchases.


• | Live our values: Our values define how we manage our business and make decisions. Our core values are Loving our Users, Doing the Right Thing, Debating It, Owning Our Outcomes, Making Fast Decisions, and Getting Better. We believe these values are essential to our ability to build a high-performing company that makes us proud and creates shareholder value.


• | Field the best team in the game: We are as good as our people, and we have some of the best in the world. We will continue to hire, coach, develop, and support the most talented and effective team in the industry.

We believe our strategy will best serve our users and business partners and drive significant long-term shareholder value. 
Competition
We compete with companies that seek the attention of our audience and/or the advertising and marketing budgets of our business partners, including, but not limited to, local marketplaces, general market media and internet companies, wedding and baby media and internet companies, social networks, and search engines. We expect ongoing competition because of the size of the markets we serve and business opportunities presented by the growth of the internet and transactional marketplaces. Competition may also intensify as a result of industry consolidation and a lack of substantial barriers to entry in our market. For information regarding competition-related risks, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the caption “We face intense competition in our markets. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected.”
Infrastructure and Technology
Our technology infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. We strive to continually improve our technology to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency, scalability, and security.
There are four major components to our online services comprised of our application, domain name service (“DNS”), network infrastructure, and database servers. Our application, DNS servers, and network infrastructure allow for the failure of multiple components with minimal or no effect expected on site operations. We have multiple database servers along with data caching serving various parts of our sites, allowing us to segregate parts of the sites for maintenance and upgrades.
Our operations are dependent on the ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications system in effective working order and to protect our systems against damage from fire, theft, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, or similar events. A portion of our systems hardware is located at a Level 1 third-party facility in Austin, Texas, and a second failover site with restoration capabilities in Omaha, Nebraska. The data centers are network-connected and application data is replicated from Austin to Omaha on a continuous basis. We have similar capacity in China for our software development operations there. Additionally, the majority of our production applications are on the Amazon Web Services Cloud (AWS). Our operations depend, in part, on the ability of these third parties to protect their own systems and our systems from similar unexpected adverse events. These third parties provide us with auxiliary power through the use of battery and diesel generators in the event of an unexpected power outage. We maintain multiple backups of our important data, allowing us to recover from a disaster. 
Regular capacity planning allows us to upgrade existing hardware and integrate new hardware to react quickly to a rapidly expanding member base and increased traffic to our sites. Our systems generally operate at 99% uptime. We employ several layers of security to protect data transmission and prevent unauthorized access. We are certified PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliant with Bank of America and American Express. Credit card processing is outsourced to secure Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms such as CyberSource and Braintree. We keep all of our production servers behind firewalls. We do not permit direct outside access, and we enforce strict password management with two-factor authentication for remote access and physical security measures. We monitor all critical systems continuously, and incident response teams respond to alerts as warranted by their risk level. We have also contracted the services of an outside company to independently monitor our site to help ensure that the site is available.

Government Regulation 
We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that apply to transactions, online services, and the internet generally. Such laws address a range of issues, such as user privacy, freedom of expression, unsolicited commercial e-mail (spam), other forms of customer outreach, pricing, payments, content and quality of services and products, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights, net neutrality, information and cybersecurity, and restrictions or technological requirements regarding the collection, use, storage, protection or transfer of consumer data. We monitor applicable domestic and foreign legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments.
Regulators and industry groups have also released self-regulatory principles and guidelines for various data privacy and security practices. Interpretation of these laws and guidelines and their application to online services in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions is ongoing, and cannot be fully determined at this time. 
For more information regarding the risks associated with government regulation, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the captions: “Fraudulent or unlawful activities on our marketplace could harm our business, and could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our marketplace,” “We may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content,” “Privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services” and “We could face additional regulatory requirements, tax liabilities and other risks related to our continuing operations in China and Hong Kong, and other markets outside the United States where we may commence operations.”
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 
We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names and patents to protect our intellectual property. We own a portfolio of patents and patent applications in the United States and file patent applications to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business, including intellectual property related to gift registry systems and methods. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products and services. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and trade names in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. Our portfolio of trademarks and trade names include “The Knot”, “The Bump”, and “GigMasters”, as well as others. We also own copyrights, including certain content in our websites, publications and designs on certain of our products. These intellectual property rights are important to our business and marketing efforts. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, including registration, in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as contractual restrictions. The duration of property rights in trademarks, service marks and trade names in the United States, whether registered or not, is predicated on our continued use. We are currently using all of our material marks. We have renewed the registrations (or applied for variant forms of the registration, where appropriate, to assure continued protection) of our material registered trademarks. We plan to continue to use all of our material brand names and marks and to renew the registrations of all of our material registered trademarks so long as we continue to use them. We enforce and protect our intellectual property rights through litigation from time to time, and by controlling access to our intellectual property and proprietary technology, in part, by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties.
We have granted licenses to other parties to sell specified products under trademarks in specified distribution channels and geographic areas. Some of these license agreements contain advertising commitments. Some are for a short term and may not contain specific renewal options. We do not license from third parties any trademarks that are material to our business.
Seasonality
We believe the impact of the frequency of weddings varying from quarter-to-quarter results in lower transactions revenue in the first and fourth quarters. Our publishing business experiences fluctuations resulting in quarter-to-quarter declines in the first and third quarters due to the cyclical publishing schedule of our regional publications. As our business continues to change, we could experience new and potentially different seasonal patterns in the future.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 741 full-time employees, of whom 378 were involved in product and content development, 297 were involved in sales and marketing and 66 were involved in general and administrative functions. Of these totals, 149 employees were located in China. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work-stoppages, and we consider relations with our employees to be good.

Segments and Geographic Areas
We operate in one reportable segment, as we are organized around our online and offline media. Our Chief Executive Officer is our Chief Operating Decision Maker, and he receives financial results every other week, which contain revenues, cost of revenues and gross margin of the three components of our business: (i) Local Marketplace (ii) National and (iii) Transactions. We incur a substantial amount of product, content, technology, sales and marketing, and general and administrative costs that directly benefit all service lines, but are not allocated to the components. Revenue information at the product or service level is not captured in our financial reporting systems and is not included in internal management reporting.
Information about geographic revenue is set forth in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Segments and Geographic Areas.” For a discussion of the risks related to foreign operations, see the information in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” under the caption “We could face additional regulatory requirements, tax liabilities and other risks related to our continuing operations in China and Hong Kong, and other markets outside the United States where we may commence operations.” For a discussion of revenue, net income and total assets, see Part II, Items 7 and 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We were incorporated in the state of Delaware and commenced operations in 1996. In 1999, we listed on the NASDAQ National Market. We transferred our listing from the NASDAQ Global Market to the New York Stock Exchange in June 2011. At the same time, we changed our corporate name to XO Group Inc. (from The Knot, Inc.), and our stock symbol to XOXO (from KNOT), in order to highlight our expanded footprint across multiple life stages.
