Corporate Overview
 
Our company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 25, 2012 under the name Cold Cam, Inc. and originally intended to develop a camera system to be placed on the inside of refrigerator doors.
 
On January 31, 2015, Yonekatsu Kato, formerly our company's sole officer and director, entered into a stock purchase agreement, pursuant to which he sold all of his 10,000,000 shares of our company's common stock (98% of our company's total outstanding common shares) to Magicstem Development Limited, a Seychelles corporation ("Magicstem Development") ultimately owned by Chi Man Ng, in a private transaction, for an aggregate purchase price of $50,000. The funds used for this share purchase were Magicstem Development's funds. Magicstem Development owned 98% of our company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The closing of the share purchase agreement created a change of control of our company. As a result of the change of control, and the change in our management as noted herein, our company now intends to investigate additional opportunities in an effort to enhance shareholder value. Those efforts are initially anticipated to focus on the development of stem cell cryo-preserved banking in Asia, with the expectation that primary customers would come from China.
 
On January 31, 2015, our board of directors accepted the resignation of Yonekatsu Kato as our president, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, treasurer, secretary and director.
 
The resignation of Yonekatsu Kato was not the result of any disagreements with our company regarding our operations, policies, practices or otherwise.
 
On January 31, 2015, we appointed Chi Man Ng as president, chief executive officer and director; Ka Sing Edmund Yeung as chief financial officer, treasurer, secretary and director; and Guosheng Hu as chief technology officer and director of our company. Furthermore, on July 21, 2015, our company appointed Chun-han (Peter) Lin as a director and Chun-heng (Kevin) Lin as Group Senior Manager of our company.

On April 1, 2015, our company's board of directors approved an agreement and plan of merger to merge with our wholly-owned subsidiary Magicstem Group Corp., a Nevada corporation, to effect a name change from Cold Cam, Inc. to Magicstem Group Corp. Our company remained as the surviving company. Magicstem Group Corp. was formed on October 25, 2012.
 
The name change was approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for filing with an effective date of May 4, 2015 and became effective with the OTC Markets at the opening of trading on May 4, 2015 under the symbol "MGGI".
 
On April 1, 2016 Mr. Chun-heng Lin resigned as group senior manager of our company. On April 1, 2016, we appointed Ms. Kit U Tang as group senior manager of our company.
 
Following the closing of the acquisition of 100% equity interest of Info-Nice Limited, on October 11, 2016 we appointed Mr. Fong Sze Hung as director of our company.  
 
Our Current Business
 
At this time, we have not developed our product or contacted any potential clients or developers. Our company has not yet implemented its business model and to date, has generated no revenues.
 
During fiscal 2016 we sought to identify and evaluate business opportunities in an effort to enhance shareholder value. In this regards, our efforts focused on the development of stem cell cryo-preserved banking in Asia, with the expectation that primary customers would come from China. Following these efforts, effective September 20, 2016, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Info-Nice Limited (“Info-Nice”), a Hong Kong company, and its sole shareholder, Mr. Fong-Sze Hung. Info-Nice is a start-up company mainly focused on the agency and distribution of stem cell cryo preserved banking services in the Asia Pacific region. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, on October 11, 2016, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Info-Nice Limited in exchange for 5,664,200 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001, which constituted 36% of our issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully-diluted basis. As result of the transaction, Info-Nice became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and we have adopted its business.
 
Overview of Info-Nice
 
As of the closing date of the Share Exchange Agreement on October 11, 2016 we decided it is in the best interest of the company to replace the prior business of refrigerator doors camera development with a distribution and agency business of mesenchymal stem cells cryopreservation services and stem cell banking facilities that is located in Shanghai City, PRC, and as a result have concluded the acquisition of Info-Nice.
 
We plan to solicit customers from APAC Region who are willing to cryo-preserve, on a long-term basis, their own mesenchymal stem cells that could be harvested from one of the following 6 types of the customer’s human body tissue:
 
 
· | umbilical cord matrix;
--+-----------------------
· | placenta; 
· | dental pulp; 
· | menstrual blood; 
· | adipose tissue; and 
· | amnion tissue. 

  
 Stem cells are unspecialized cells in human body that are characteristically of the same family type. They retain the ability to divide throughout life and give rise to cells that can become highly specialized and take the place of cells in human body that die or are lost, a unique property known as plasticity. Stem cells contribute to human body's ability to renew and repair its tissues. Unlike mature cells, which are permanently committed to their fate, stem cells can both renew themselves and create new cells of whatever tissue they belong to (and other tissues).

According to National Institute of Health of the United States, there are 2 types of adult stem cells in the human body:
 
 
· | Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Mesenchymal stem cells are found in the bone marrow of adults, among other non-bone marrow sources including but not limited to dental pulp, human amnion, adipose tissue and menstrual blood. They are multipotent stromal cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell types, including bone cells, cartilage cells, muscle cells and fat cells. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Haematopoietic stem cells are found in the bone marrow of adults, human blood from an infant’s placenta and umbilical cord, and mobilized peripheral blood. They are the early precursor cells capable of differentiating into blood cells and immune system cells in the body, namely red blood cells, B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and macrophages.

  
 Cryopreservation and banking of mesenchymal stem cells from human body tissue allows pooling of these adult stem cells via long-term storage to maintain the aforesaid functional properties of such cells, and capture the opportunities made available by evolving medical treatments and technologies such as stem cell transplants, cell-based therapies on certain diseases in the future. 
Distribution Agreements
 
The mesenchymal stem cells cryopreservation services and cell banking facilities that Info-Nice Limited distributes is operating under the brand name “Asia Stem Cell Bank” and is physically located in Shanghai International Medical Zone, Shanghai City, PRC. Asia Stem Cell Bank is jointly operated by Shanghai Kun Ai Biotechnology Co., Ltd., (“Kun Ai”) a PRC incorporated company, and Asia Stem Cell BK. Limited, a Hong Kong incorporated company. 
 
On December 19, 2015, Info-Nice entered into an agreement with Kun Ai and Guangzhou Bai Ming Biotech Limited, a PRC incorporated company ("Bai Ming"), pursuant to which Info-Nice and Bai Ming were both appointed as non-exclusive distributors to sell, market and distribute Asia Stem Cell Bank service packages (“Said Agreement”) until October 21, 2019. The Said Agreement did not specify territories of distribution, and called for a separate consent between Info-Nice and Bai Ming with respect to the pricing structure of stem cell storage packages, payment method, and mode of distribution. 
 
On January 1, 2016 Info-Nice Limited subsequently entered into an agreement with Bai Ming, pursuant to which: (a) on the basis of the Said Agreement, Info-Nice identified its distribution right to cover APAC region including but not limited to China, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea during the period January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018, and such term shall subject to auto-renewal unless otherwise agreed by both parties; and (b) Bai Ming shall be responsible for harvesting stem cells from the customers and the logistic fulfillment and delivery of cryo-preserved mesenchymal stem cells to the premises of Kun Ai in Shanghai.
 
Bai Ming is wholly-owned by Mr. Guosheng Hu, chief technology officer and director of our company. The business relationship between Bai Ming and Kun Ai dated back to October 22, 2014 when Mr. Hu and Ms. Chi Man Ng, the president, chief executive officer and director of our company intended to establish distribution business of Asia Stem Cell Bank by entering into a distribution agreement between Kun Ai and Bai Ming, on 5 years term expiring on October 21, 2019, pursuant to which Bai Ming was authorized to distribute Asia Stem Cell Bank, subject to the condition that Bai Ming shall make available a pre-payment in the amount of RMB 500,000 (or approximately USD 79,400) and payable to Kun Ai. Furthermore, Bai Ming is obliged to provide to Kun Ai another RMB 500,000 (or approximately USD 79,400) as refundable guarantee. On Nov 4, 2014 the distribution right under this agreement was temporarily outsourced and assigned to Magicstem Enterprises Hong Kong Limited, a Hong Kong company wholly owned by Ms. Ng. Owing to limited financial resources, Magicstem Enterprise was not successful in implementing its distribution network, and it eventually abandoned the business before contract expiry.

Overview of "APAC" and China Economy
 
APAC has remained to be the engine of the global economy to meet the challenges of a still weak global recovery and slow global trade. According to World Bank’s statistics, the GDP of East Asia and Pacific was USD 21,281,190 million, representing approximately 29% of the world’s GDP in 2015. Growth in the Asia-Pacific economies is expected to decelerate slightly to about 5.3% during year 2016-17, according to the latest Regional Economic Outlook for Asia and Pacific, published on May 3, 2016, which is the result of sluggish global recovery and slowing global trade. Among East Asia and Pacific region, China remains to be the leading country in terms of GDP and contributed USD 10,866,444 million or 14.80% to the world’s economy in 2015.

Overview of Stem Cells Industry in APAC and China
 
APAC is expected to be the fastest growing market of cord stem cell banking. According to a 2016 report provided by Data Bridge Market Research, global cord stem cell banking market has accounted value of USD 1.5 billion in 2015 and is expected to reach USD 6.3 billion by 2022, growing at a CAGR of 22.4% in the forecast period 2016 to 2022. In 2016, an estimated 940.3 thousand cord cells and tissues were banked globally, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.7% in the forecast period 2016 to 2022 reaching 2,141.1 thousand by 2022. Based on product type, mesenchymal stem cell banking is ranked next to cord blood banking, the latter of which is having 63.7% market share in terms of value.
 
The report further anticipated that APAC is expected to be the fastest growing market in the forecasted years owing to this population size, China alone can have a significant impact on the stem cell banking market. Based on geography the global cord stem cell banking market is segmented into 5 geographical regions, namely North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, South America and rest of the world. The geographical regions are further segmented into 24 major countries such as U.S. Canada, Mexico, Germany, France, U.K., Belgium, Switzerland, Belgium, Turkey, Japan, China, Singapore, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa and many others. North America is expected to dominate the global market with 43.7% market share in 2016. 
 
Cord stem cell banking is one of the segments among China’s highly diversified and fragmented stem cells industry, which also includes other segments like stem cells expansion and sub-culture, stem cell acquisition, and stem cell production. According to Stem Cell Research Market to 2017 published by GBI Research, the sales of stem cell industry in China will maintain at a CAGR of 170% between 2012 and 2017, reaching RMB 30 billion (or $4.88 billion) in 2017.
 
Mesenchymal stem cells banking industry in China
 
Our management believe Info-Nice’s distribution business of Asia Stem Cell Bank services shall largely come from customers in China. Compared to the industrial statistics that 8 to 10 in every hundred delivering US families opt to reserve their stem cells, only Beijing City of China comes close with a proportion of 14%, while on average the current number of Chinese families that have chosen to preserve is 0.7%. The management believes mesenchymal stem cells banking is a new and emerging market.
 
At the moment mesenchymal stem cells cryopreservation and banking services as an industry itself is unregulated in China, except it is only regulated from the perspective of Company Law of China. With respect to industry specific laws and regulations, most of them are confined on banking of haematopoietic stem cells harvested from umbilical cord blood of Chinese.

According to Administrative Measure of Umbilical Cord Blood Haematopoietic Stem Cell Banks, which was promulgated by Ministry of Health of People’s Republic of China (“MOH”) on May 26, 1999 and became effective on Oct 1, 1999, all the umbilical cord blood haematopoietic stem cell banks in PRC shall subject to the approval of related health administrative offices under the State Council of China. The measure further ruled out the possibility of purely commercial umbilical cord blood haematopoietic stem cell banks. All of these haematopoietic stem cell banks are allowed to provide commercial services on a subscription basis under the condition that they concurrently provide free services to store stem cells obtained by blood donation of the general public.
 
China’s government intended to establish umbilical cord blood haematopoietic stem cell banks in 10 provinces and major cities, namely Beijing City, Tianjin City, Shanghai City, Chongqing City, Guangdong Province, Sichuan Province, Shandong Province, Zhejiang Province, Liaoning Province and Gansu Province. Official government support, authorization, and permits would be required. Only one license will be granted to an operator in each designated province or city. As of end of year 2014, 7 provinces and cities except Chongqing City, Liaoning Province and Gansu Province have established umbilical cord blood haematopoietic stem cell blood banks. China Cord Blood Corporation has since earned permits for three of the seven Chinese provinces (holding majority share of the Chinese HSCs banking market) and is now competing as one of the fastest growing cord blood banks in the world, running in parallel to a number of private umbilical cord blood haematopoietic stem cell banks. In October 2011, the general office of MOH announced in Circular of Strengthening the Administration of Umbilical Cord Blood Haematopoietic Stem Cell that unauthorized harvest of haematopoietic stem cells from umbilical cord blood is prohibited, and called for cleaning up industrial players without license.
 
At the moment mesenchymal stem cells cryopreservation and banking is unregulated in China. The management believes this creates a flexible business environment for the development of our company. There can be no assurance that mesenchymal stem cells banking will be regulated in the future in the same manner as that of umbilical cord blood haematopoietic stem cell banking.
 
Drivers for Future Growth
 
Future demand for the mesenchymal stem cells banking industry in China and APAC is expected to be driven mainly by the following factors:
 
 
· | Large number of newborns. According to the estimate of United Nation and statistics of National Statistics Bureau of China, PRC had a population of 1.38 billion persons by June 30, 2016 and 16.6 million newborns as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. In November 2013, Chinese government decided to ease its “one-child” policy, allowing more than 11 million eligible Chinese couples in the country to have two children under the condition that either parent was an only child. The large number of newborns in China provides substantial potential for mesenchymal stem cells bank operators in China to grow their subscriber base. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The Coming of Aging Society. After more than three decades of the one-child policy, China is now becoming a rapidly aging society. A quarter of its population will be over 60 by year 2050, which in turn could place an enormous strain on the healthcare system, as the number of people with degenerative diseases grows. China already has more people with dementia than any other country, while a new study suggests two out of every 1000,000 in the nation have Parkinson’s. Mesenchymal stem cells banking could prepare Chinese people to stave off a healthcare crisis by offering much-needed treatments for these chronic illnesses. 
· | Growth in GDP in China. According to data from Trading Economics, GDP in China being the engine of APAC economy grew by 7.15%, 6.73%, and 6.36% in 2013 and 2014, and 2015 respectively. Amidst the tightening of global financial conditions, domestic demand and internal consumption is expected to be a major driver of activity across APAC and China. As average disposable income rises, families are likely to spend an increased proportion of their disposable income on healthcare, including subscriptions for mesenchymal stem cells banking services. 
· | Stem cell therapy as national strategic needs. Stem cell research and therapy in general had received a lot of emphasis at Chinese policy level. A large number of stem cell researches received government grants up to$5 million under National Hi-Tech R&D Plan (or known as Plan 863) announced in March 1986, and National Key Fundamental R&D Plan (or known as Plan 973) announced in March 1997. The National Natural Science Foundation of China has also contributed grants, boosting funding from just over RMB 100 million in 2008 to more than RMB 450 million in 2012. Stem cell researches were further regarded as the fundamental research addressing the needs of China national strategies during the thirteenth Five Year Plan covering the period from 2016 to 2020.


8


· | Increasing clinical application of mesenchymal stem cells. According to Nayoun Kim and Seok-Goo Cho, results of multiple clinical trials using mesenchymal stem cells on various disorders of human body has been promising, including orthopedic injuries, graft versus host disease following bone marrow transplantation, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, and liver diseases, but also highlight the critical challenges that must be addressed in the future. More research is needed to determine the mechanisms and biological properties of MSCs to enhance their therapeutic efficacy in various diseases. As stem cell therapy continues to develop in China and elsewhere in the world, more people are likely to store their mesenchymal stem cells therapy to capture the future technological improvement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Increasing public awareness of the benefits associated with cord blood banking services. Operators of mesenchymal stem cells banks in China focus their sales and marketing efforts in hospitals, prenatal clinics and wedding registries to increase the public awareness of the benefits associated with mesenchymal stem cells banking by providing potential customers education on mesenchymal stem cells banking procedure and potential benefits. Continuous customer education and expanded sales and marketing networks enable the operators to tap into a potential sizeable market with increased penetration rates and enlarged subscriber base. 

Distribution Methods and Customers
 
The management believes that the distribution business of Info-Nice shall rely heavily on the extensive network to be developed in APAC countries, and an effective customer referral program. Leveraging on the brand awareness of Asia Stem Cell Bank in APAC, we have a marketing strategy mainly based on referrals from our existing customers, medical professionals and industry experts.
 
Recruitment of Sub-distributors in APAC countries
 
Mr. Fong Sze Hung, the director of Info-Nice Limited, has an extensive business network and connections, which we will reply upon to recruit high quality sub-distributors in APAC, which enables us to effectively identify and target our potential customers.
 
Competition and Market Position
 
Competition in the mesenchymal stem cells cryopreservation and banking industries is global in nature. Cord blood banks targeting MSCs as well as HSCs exist in every developed country, as well as within most developing nations. With approximately 500 cord blood banks operating worldwide, pursuant to an industrial report provided by bioinformant.com, from maturation of the global cord blood market means that each cord blood bank is now fighting harder for market share. In 2008, a Taiwanese company, HealthBanks Biotech Company Ltd. became the first company to offer cord tissue storage, but it was not until July 2010 that the first private U.S. cord blood bank began offering the service (Cord Blood Registry). Since then, the trend of cord tissue storage has had a significant impact on the cord blood banking industry, with a large percentage of cord blood banks worldwide offering the service. 
 
In China, competitors of Asia Stem Cell Bank consist of mainly the following companies, which are local and foreign-invested enterprises in China and may have financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources greater than the mesenchymal stem cells cryopreservation and banking facilities that Info-Nice distribute: 
 


(i) | VCANBIO Stem Cell Bank and Beike Biotechnology Co. Ltd., with respect to cryopreservation and banking of both mesenchymal stem cells and haematopoietic stem cells; 
------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | China Cord Blood Corporation, with respect to cryopreservation and banking of haematopoietic stem cells harvested from umbilical cord blood (iii) SINOPEC Baling Company;
(iii) | Shanghai Cord Blood Bank; 
(iv) | Zhongyuan Union Stem Cell Bio-engineering 


9

 
Our competitive position will depend on our ability to secure a stable and long term contractual relationship between Info-Nice and Kun Ai, achieve economies of scale by developing more sub-distributors across APAC, develop and implement effective sales and marketing strategies and plans, and secure adequate capital resources. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of quality of cell banking services in Shanghai, reliability, economies of scale, experienced and stable management and sales team and customer value. We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. However, there can be no assurance that even if we perform as expected we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry.
 
Government Regulations
 
Overview
 
We operate our business in China under a legal regime consisting of the State Council, which is the highest authority of the executive branch of the PRC central government, and several ministries and agencies under its authority including but not limited Ministry of Health and State Food and Drug Administration,
 
China is transitioning from a planned economy to a market economy. While the Chinese government has pursued economic reforms since its adoption of the open-door policy in 1978, a large portion of the Chinese economy is still operating under five-year plans and annual state plans. Through these plans and other economic measures, such as control on foreign exchange, taxation and legal restrictions on foreign participation in the domestic market of various industries, the Chinese government exerts considerable direct and indirect influence on the economy. Many of the economic reforms carried out by the Chinese government are unprecedented or experimental, and are expected to be refined and improved. Other political, economic and social factors can also lead to further readjustment of such reforms. This refining and readjustment process may not necessarily have a positive effect on our operations or future business development. Our operating revenue may be reduced by changes in China's economic and social conditions as well as by changes in the policies of the Chinese government, such as changes in laws and regulations (or the official interpretation thereof), measures which may be introduced to control inflation, changes in the interest rate or method of taxation, and the imposition of additional restrictions on currency conversion.
 
China’s legal system is a civil law system. Unlike the common law system, the civil law system is based on written statutes in which decided legal cases have little value as precedents. In 1979, China began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and has since introduced many laws and regulations to provide general guidance on economic and business practices in China and to regulate foreign investment. Progress has been made in the promulgation of laws and regulations dealing with economic matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. The promulgation of new laws, changes of existing laws and the abrogation of local regulations by national laws could have a negative impact on our business and business prospects. In addition, as these laws, regulations and legal requirements are relatively recent, their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainty.
 
Regulation on mesenchymal stem cell banking
 
We operate our business in the absence of a defined legal context directly related to mesenchymal stem cell banking. Mesenchymal stem cell banking is an emerging industry in China. Therefore, the regulatory framework of mesenchymal stem cell banking has yet to develop as that in other countries. Current PRC laws and regulations fail to provide a clear, consistent and well-developed regulatory framework for the provision of fee-based commercial mesenchymal stem cell banking. This presents uncertainty and risks regarding fee-based commercial mesenchymal stem cell banking services in China, including our business of marketing such stem cell banking services, as described in the following paragraphs:
 


10


· | Lack of Clear Regulation. Instead of developing a clear legal framework of mesenchymal stem cell banking, in the past 16 years, the laws of PRC only regulate stem cells banking with respect to a single source of one member of the stem cell family. In May 26, 1999 MOH promulgated “Administrative Measure for Umbilical Cord Haematopoietic Stem Cells Bank (for Trial Implementation)”, which imposed regulations solely on the incorporation and business license requirement of haematopoietic stem cell banks that harvest stem cells from umbilical cord blood . In 2001, China further adopted the “Trial Umbilical Cord Haematopoietic Stem Cells Establishment Guidelines” as a means to implement the aforesaid 1999 Administrative Measure. In 2002, China adopted the “Provisional Umbilical Cord Haematopoietic Stem Cells Banks Technical Guideline”, which regulates the way and activities of processing and storing of umbilical cord blood. The MOH later refined the harvest method of haematopoietic stem cell in “Notice Relating to Enhanced Management of Umbilical Cord Haematopoietic Stem Cell Harvest which was announced and became immediately effective on October 24, 2011. None of the above laws and regulations are directly related to mesenchymal stem cell banking. Furthermore, the stem cell banking service we market does not harvest from umbilical cord blood, therefore our operation is not regulated by the current legal framework on umbilical cord blood haematopoietic stem cell banking. There could be no assurance that the mesenchymal stem cell banking services would be regulated in the same manner of haematopoietic stem cells banking services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Undefined Service For-Profit. In the current legal framework of stem cell banking, MOH declined the incorporation of fee-based commercial umbilical cord haematopoietic stem cell banks that do not concurrently perform a public blood bank role in accordance with “Administrative Measures of Blood Banks”, which was promulgated on November 17, 2005 and became effective on March 1, 2006. The Measure, however, did not define or interpret the term “non-profit”, “for-profit”, or “for the purpose of making a profit”. Our operations do not involve umbilical cord haematopoietic stem cell bank, therefore the current laws do not regulate our business with respect to the fee-based commercial practice. There could be no assurance that the mesenchymal stem cell banking services that we market would be regulated in the same manner of haematopoietic stem cells banking services. If PRC government orders mesenchymal stem cells banking operators in China to cease their fee-based commercial operations in the near future, we will not be able to market the stem cell banking services, and in turn our results of operations and liquidity would be materially adversely affected. 
· | Absence of Price Control. Currently there are no price controls on the entire stem cell banking industry in China. Therefore, Chinese operators have the flexibility to set their prices for stem cell banking services they provide. However, such price-setting flexibility will be reduced, if, as part of the implementation of medical and healthcare reforms in China, the PRC government decides to introduce price controls into the stem cell banking industry. If the PRC government were to introduce price controls or otherwise impose a price cap on stem cell services in the near future, we will not be able to continue to set a margin on top of the stem cell banking services that we market, in which case our financial condition and results of operation may be materially adversely affected. 
· | Acknowledged Business Practice. Kun Ai, which is the operator of the mesenchymal stem cell banking services that we are currently marketing, clearly stated to the competent health authorities in Shanghai, China as part of their license application that their business involves fee-based commercial stem cell banking. Furthermore, both during the application process and after the applications were approved, the competent health authorities have been conducting annual review of Kun Ai’s business and incorporation licence each year. All such evidence indicates that the MOH and its regional DOHs are aware of current business practices of a fee-based, for-profit mesenchymal stem cell banking services, conducted by a PRC incorporation. Currently there is no evidence that the applicable health authorities have any intention of prohibiting the provision of fee-based, for-profit mesenchymal stem cell banking, or any intention of revoking the licenses of Kun Ai, ordering them to terminate their business or canceling their qualifications based on the fact that they provide for-profit mesenchymal stem cell banking services. We as a marketer of for-profit mesenchymal stem cell banking services in China are not aware of any material violations of permits, licenses or approvals that have been issued with respect to our operations.
