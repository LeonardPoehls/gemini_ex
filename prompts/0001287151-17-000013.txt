Company Overview
Our machine clothing and roll cover products are primarily installed on pulp and paper-making machines and play key roles in the process by which raw materials are converted into finished paper. A fundamental characteristic of our products is that they are consumed in the paper production process and must be regularly replaced. This positions us to make recurring sales to our customers, and accordingly, the number of paper machines in operation throughout the world and the amount of paper, pulp and board produced globally each year are primary drivers of the demand for our products. In addition, our products are also installed in other industrial applications such as nonwoven and fiber cement machines.
Paper-making machines utilize different processes and have different requirements depending on the design of the machine, the raw materials used, the type of paper being made and the preferences of individual production managers. We employ our broad portfolio of patented and proprietary product and manufacturing technologies, as well as our extensive industry experience, to provide our customers with tailored solutions designed to optimize the performance of their equipment and significantly reduce the costs of their operations. We systematically track and report the impact of these customized solutions to our customers through our ValueResults™ program which quantifies the optimization process on their machines.
Our machine clothing products are highly engineered synthetic textile belts that transport and filter paper as it is processed in a paper-making machine. Machine clothing plays a significant role in the forming, pressing and drying stages of paper production. Our machine clothing segment represented 61% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, 63% in 2015 and 64% in 2014.
Roll cover products cover the rolls on a paper-making machine, which are the large steel cylinders over which machine clothing is mounted and between which the paper travels as it is processed. Our roll covers provide a surface with the mechanical properties necessary to process the paper in a cost-effective manner that delivers the sheet qualities desired by the paper producer. We currently use several hundred chemical compounds in our roll cover manufacturing process. Our roll cover segment represented 39% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, 37% in 2015 and 36% in 2014.
Our products are in constant contact with the paper during the manufacturing process. As a result, our products have a significant effect on paper quality and the ability of a paper producer to differentiate its products, two factors that we believe 
4

are increasingly important to paper producers. In addition, while machine clothing and roll covers represent only approximately 3%, on average, of a typical paper producer’s production costs, they can help a paper producer improve productivity and reduce overall costs. Our machine clothing and roll covers facilitate the paper producers' use of less expensive raw materials (including recycled fiber), their ability to run paper-making machines faster and with fewer interruptions and their ability to decrease the amount of energy required in the expensive drying portion of the paper-making process. We have found that, in certain cases, our products and services provide paper producers with cost savings that substantially offset the costs of such products and services.
We estimate that there are approximately 7,995 paper-making machines worldwide, all of which require a regular supply of machine clothing and roll covers. Machine clothing and roll covers must be replaced regularly to sustain high quality paper output and operate efficiently. Roll covers also require regular refurbishment, a service that we provide to our customers. Paper producers typically replace machine clothing multiple times per year, replace roll covers every two to five years and refurbish roll covers several times between each replacement.
We have a reputation for technological innovation in the paper-making industry. In our machine clothing segment, in recent years we have focused our research and development efforts on higher value-added, technologically advanced products, such as forming fabrics and press felts, which offer paper producers greater potential for differentiating their products through quality improvements and increasing their operating efficiency. Historically, we have pioneered a number of technologies that have become industry standards, including in our machine clothing business, synthetic forming fabrics (which replaced bronze wire technology), double-layer forming fabrics, laminated press felts and, most recently, triple-layer forming fabrics.
In our roll covers segment, we have introduced a number of innovations to our roll cover and spreader roll products in recent years, including (1) SMART™ Technology, the first continuous pressure sensing paper machine roll that enables the papermaker to maximize performance by knowing the pressure of the paper machine while the machine is running; (2) composite calendar roll covers that use nanoparticle technology to improve roll cover durability and paper gloss; (3) covers that use an improved polyurethane to increase abrasion and moisture resistance as well as responsiveness and stability; and (4) uniquely designed and proprietary grooving patterns that improve machine performance and reduce energy consumption.
Our portfolio of patented and proprietary product and manufacturing technologies differentiates our product offerings from others in the market and allows us to deliver high value products and services to our customers. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 444 issued patents and over 67 pending patent applications. Our patents and patent applications cover approximately 62 different inventions. We currently license certain of our patents and technologies to some of our competitors, which we believe helps further demonstrate our technological leadership in the industry. We believe that the technological sophistication of the products needed in our business and the capital-intensive nature of our business present significant challenges to any potential new competitors in our field.
We organized our business in 1999 in connection with the acquisition of the paper technology group of Invensys plc. We completed our initial public offering on May 19, 2005.
Recent Developments
New Technology
In December 2016, the Company introduced TransForm, a new generation of forming fabrics designed specifically for paperboard and packaging machines that lowers energy consumption and extends fabric life, among other considerable benefits. The TransForm technology is applicable for machines producing: paperboard, containerboard, fluting/corrugating, linerboard, kraft bag, liquid packaging board, food and beverage containers, bleach board, white top paperboard, boxboard, and other related subgrades. We believe that Transform helps our customers reduce energy consumption by more than 15 percent while extending fabric life between 15 and 25 percent.
 Asian Expansion
In the fourth quarter of 2016, we surpassed 1,000 shipments of press felt from our new state-of-the-art machine clothing plant located in Kunshan, China. As a result of our new Kunshan facility, we are now routinely producing press felt solutions locally for customers in China and the Asia-Pacific region. Our Kunshan plant is located in the heart of the Yangtze River paper-making region in China, at the center of the largest papermaking region in the world. Prior to building the Kunshan plant, we served the Asia region as an exporter of products made in Europe. With the Kunshan facility, we have significantly increased our competitive position and is now closely partnering with customers in China and the rest of Asia. Xerium has a multi-year plan to continue expanding the scope of machine clothing production in Kunshan. We are underway right now with an expansion to make forming fabrics in Kunshan.

Global Trends in Paper Demand
The Company's markets have gone through a tough business cycle. Demand for the Company’s products are tied to our customer’s production rates and our product’s useful lives. While the majority of the Company’s end markets are growing, certain graphical grade paper production market segments have been in decline. Non-declining markets make up greater than 75% of the Company’s business model. Production of these grades of paper and board (tissue, paper towels, napkins, cardboard, consumer packaging, consumer durable packaging, e-commerce packaging) is steady and/or increasing globally. Declining grades of paper production are newsprint globally, and printing/writing papers in mature economies with full access to wireless/digital media. These market corrections have been very strong in the last few years and many paper machines dedicated to graphical paper production have been closed. At the same time, new machines have been installed to make the growing grades of paper and board. Both of these trends are continuing. In order to optimize outcomes in this changing environment, the Company has been implementing a repositioning program to re-map its plant locations, people, products, equipment tooling, and machine services offered to more naturally align with growing markets both geographically and by type of paper machine serviced. 
Business Strategy

• | Correct footprint in order to deliver market competitive lead-times and cost structures, and outfit equipment to pursue new growth business - in the last four years, we closed and relocated equipment from declining market areas and into growing areas. Specifically, the Company closed 8 manufacturing locations as the source of new capacity, retooled and relocated that equipment to 9 other locations, and has 1 additional new plant under construction. That new plant will also receive equipment from the other locations.


Closed/Provide Equipment to Others | Installed Equipment/Repositioned for Growth
1. Argentina MC plant | 1. Canada MC plant 
2. Brazil MC plant | 2. Austria MC plant 
3. Charlotte, NC rolls plant | 3. Brazil MC plant 
4. Canada MC plant | 4. Chile rolls plant (new, underway) 
5. France rolls plant | 5. China MC plant (new) 
6. Germany rolls plant | 6. China rolls plant

• | Renovate products & services to leadership levels in order to secure New Business Wins on targeted machines - 90 new products in the last four years, several core mechanical service offerings were added into certain roll repair centers, patent portfolio expanded to 444 total patents with 67 pending applications. Company has added new sales personnel and is marketing to new market segments including: pulp, tissue, fiber cement, non-paper industries, paper and tissue converting, Turkey and Middle East markets, China and Asian markets, Mexico and Central American markets, Chile and South American markets. 


• | Create a unified, low-cost business model with one set of value-added processes - eliminate redundancy between regions and amongst product groups, supplement and top-grade team in certain areas, unify ERP and business systems, connect data streams into cohesive value-added processes using Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) methodologies, and implement Lean Six Sigma in every plant globally.


• | Pay down debt and deleverage the Company - after the majority of repositioning activities have been accomplished to install a go-forward business model, use excess free cash flow to pay down debt over a multi-year period in order to deleverage the company.

Products
We operate through two principal business segments, machine clothing and roll covers. Our machine clothing segment products include various types of industrial textiles used on paper-making machines and other industrial applications. Through our roll covers segment, we manufacture various types of roll covers, refurbish previously installed roll covers, provide 
6

mechanical services for the internal mechanisms of rolls used on paper-making machines and manufacture spreader rolls. For additional financial information about our machine clothing and roll covers segments, please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 12 "Business Segment Information" to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements.
Machine Clothing Products
Our machine clothing segment products are large, highly engineered synthetic textile belts that transport paper as it is processed in a paper-making machine from paper stock into finished paper. Machine clothing products must be tailored to each machine because all paper-making machines have different physical configurations and operating parameters. Machine clothing generally ranges in size from approximately 7 feet to over 30 feet wide and 24 feet to more than 460 feet long and operates on paper-making machines that run at speeds up to 7,500 feet per minute. 
We manufacture three general types of machine clothing products used on paper-making machines—forming fabrics, press felts and dryer fabrics—each of which is located in a different section of a paper machine. Forming fabrics and press felts are typically replaced multiple times a year, but replacement frequency varies significantly by the grade of paper being produced, the manner in which the paper-making machine is operated and the quality of raw materials used in the paper stock. Dryer fabrics are replaced less frequently, with replacement typically taking place approximately once per year.
Forming fabrics. Forming fabrics are used at the beginning of paper-making machines, where highly diluted paper stock is deposited on the forming fabric while the fabric is traveling at a very high speed. Forming fabrics allow water to drain from the paper stock, creating an initial wet sheet. Forming fabrics must be sufficiently porous to allow water to drain evenly and quickly, yet tight enough to retain and align the fiber and other materials that form the sheet of paper. They must also be strong enough to withstand high mechanical stresses. Forming fabrics are custom-manufactured in single, double and triple layer designs in a variety of meshes to suit particular machines and paper grades. Customers are increasingly demanding the higher-priced triple layer designs that remove more moisture and produce higher quality paper. In 2016, forming fabrics accounted for approximately 34% of net sales in our machine clothing segment.
Press felts. Press felts are used to carry the paper sheet through a series of press rolls that mechanically press water from the sheet under high pressure. Press felts are designed to maximize water removal, which reduces the amount of water that must be removed during the expensive energy-intensive drying section of the production process. Press felts must maximize water removal while maintaining the orientation of the fibers and the consistency of the thickness of the paper, without removing chemicals or fillers from the paper.
Press felts differ from forming fabrics and dryer fabrics due to the addition of several layers of staple fiber that are needled into the fabric base. The staple fiber provides a smooth surface to meet the wet sheet of paper and creates a wicking effect to remove water from the paper sheet as it is pressed under high pressure between press rolls. Press felts are manufactured in a variety of designs, including lightweight single layer felts, multi-layer laminated endless felts and seamed felts that allow for reduced installation times. In 2016, press felts accounted for approximately 47% of net sales in our machine clothing segment.
Dryer fabrics. Dryer fabrics are used to transport the paper sheet through the drying section of paper-making machines, where high temperatures from large, steam-heated dryer cylinders evaporate the remaining moisture from the paper sheet. Dryer fabrics, which are less technically advanced than forming fabrics or press felts, are woven from heat-resistant yarns with a coarser mesh than forming fabrics. In 2016, dryer fabrics accounted for approximately 5% of net sales in our machine clothing segment.
Industrials and Other. We manufacture other fabrics used in other industrial applications, such as pulp, non-woven textiles, fiber cement, tannery sludge de-watering and textiles manufacturing. In 2016, net sales for such industrial applications accounted for 14% of net sales in our machine clothing segment.
 New Machine Clothing Products. The major goal of research and development is to create customer value and solutions by combining latest technologies with excellent quality and unique product characteristics. This commitment will improve our competitive position and ensures a continuously optimized product portfolio. In recent years, we have focused our research and development efforts on higher performance, value-added, sustainable product solutions throughout our entire machine clothing offering. Our efforts have resulted in several innovative and revolutionary new forming fabric and press felt product solutions, which prove their performance benefits globally every day.

Roll Covers and Services
In our roll covers segment (or "rolls segment"), the majority of our sales are generated through the replacement and refurbishment of roll covers and spreader rolls, the manufacturing of new spreader rolls and general mechanical maintenance and repair services for the internal mechanisms of rolls.
Roll covers. We manufacture, refurbish and replace covers of all types of roll applications used in paper-making machines, such as press section rolls including suction rolls, lump breaker rolls, coater rolls, sizing rolls, calendar rolls and all purpose conveying rolls. There can be up to 200 such rolls in a typical paper-making machine. These metal rolls, which can be up to 39 feet long, 6 feet in diameter and weigh 500 to 140,000 pounds, are covered with an exterior layer of rubber, polyurethane, composite or ceramic, each of which is designed for use in a particular phase of the paper-making process. Roll covers operate in temperatures up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, under pressures up to 12,000 pounds per square inch and at speeds up to 10,000 feet per minute. Roll covers are typically replaced every two to five years.
Roll cover replacement is performed at the manufacturing facility of the supplier, such as Xerium, which necessitates removing the roll from the paper-making machine, transporting it to the supplier’s site and using a spare roll in the interim. In general, each roll on a paper-making machine is unique due to its dimensions, specific design and cover material, and generally not interchangeable with other rolls. Because of their large size, paper producers generally maintain only one spare roll for each position on a paper-making machine. It is important that the roll cover replacement be completed quickly, because damage or a malfunction of the spare roll could render the paper-making machine inoperable.
Due to the large size and weight of a roll, transportation to and from a supplier’s site can be costly and is occasionally subject to regulations on road use that restrict available routes and times of travel, and that may require safety escorts. Round-trip transcontinental travel can take several weeks and intercontinental travel is rare. We offer an extensive network of manufacturing facilities worldwide, often in close proximity to our customers, which we believe is a significant competitive advantage.
Roll covers accounted for approximately 55% of our total net sales in our roll covers segment in 2016.
Services. Roll covers are typically refurbished several times over the two to five years they are in service before needing to be replaced. Refurbishment typically includes the regrinding of the roll cover to standard specifications and inspecting the bearings and other mechanical components of the roll. As with roll cover replacement, refurbishment is performed at the supplier’s manufacturing facility. Similar to the paper producer’s selection of a roll cover supplier, the selection of a refurbishment provider is influenced by the time and expense of transporting a roll cover.
We offer a wide range of mechanical maintenance and repair services for the internal mechanisms of rolls. Paper producers are increasingly finding it economical to have the company that refurbishes or replaces a roll cover also perform work on the internal roll mechanisms at the same time, which avoids having multiple suppliers and incurring additional time and transportation charges. We have begun performing such services to meet the demands of our customers and gain a competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2016, we provide major mechanical services at ten locations around the world. Roll cover refurbishment services and mechanical services accounted for approximately 25% of our total net sales in our roll covers segment in 2016.
Spreader rolls. We manufacture and repair spreader rolls, which are small-diameter curved rolls used throughout a paper-making machine to stretch, smooth and remove wrinkles from the paper and machine clothing. There are approximately five to seven spreader rolls in a typical paper-making machine. Spreader rolls and related services accounted for approximately 18% of our total net sales in our roll covers segment in 2016.
New Roll Products. We have introduced a number of innovations to our roll cover and spreader roll products in recent years, including composite calendar roll covers that use nanoparticle technology to improve roll cover durability and paper gloss, as well as covers that use an improved polyurethane to increase abrasion and moisture resistance as well as responsiveness and stability. We are evaluating new products, which will use different materials and utilize different sales channels and provide enhancements to our existing product line. The acquisition of Spencer Johnston in May of 2016 broadened the Company's capabilities with respect to spreader rolls, dandy rolls, and tissue embossing rolls. Sales generated by these new and other roll products account for approximately 2% of our total net sales in our roll covers segment in 2016.
Customers
We supply leading paper producers worldwide. Our top ten customers accounted for 26.6% of net sales in 2016 and individually, no customer accounted for more than 6% of 2016 net sales. In 2016, we generated 39% of our net sales in North America, 32% in Europe, 10% in Latin America and 19% in Asia-Pacific. See Note 12 "Business Segment Information" to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for geographic information related to net sales and long-lived assets.

Due to competitive market forces, we offer our customers payment terms similar to those offered by our competitors. Also, agreements with certain customers require us to maintain modest amounts of finished machine clothing inventory to assure those customers of supply continuity. We do not maintain finished rolls inventories.
Competition
 Our largest competitors are the two leading manufacturers of paper-making machines and one independent machine clothing producer. In addition, we also face competition from smaller regional suppliers.
We compete primarily based on the value, price and production lead times of our products. Competition with respect to both machine clothing and roll covers, particularly as it relates to our technologically advanced forming fabrics, press felts and roll covers, is based primarily on the value that the products deliver to the paper producer through the ability of such products to reduce production costs and improve paper quality. Also, because our customers operate continuously, we aim to offer competitive delivery schedules from customer order to placement in their machines. 
Competition in the machine clothing and roll covers market is also based on a supplier’s ability to deliver engineering and technical services. Many paper producers have been reducing their in-house engineering and technical staff and increasingly expect their suppliers to provide such services. While smaller suppliers often lack the resources necessary to invest in and provide this level of engineering and technical service, we have made investments in order to provide the following services to the paper producers: specialist advice and resident engineers, installation support, on-call “trouble-shooting” and performance monitoring and analysis of paper-making machines.
In the roll covers market, competition is also based on a supplier’s proximity to the paper producer’s facilities, which affects the transportation time and expense associated with refurbishing or replacing a roll cover, and on the supplier’s ability to provide mechanical services to a roll’s internal mechanisms while the roll cover is being refurbished or replaced. We offer an extensive network of facilities throughout the world and provide mechanical services at the majority of our locations.
Research and Development
Our continuing ability to deliver value depends on developing product innovations. As we create new and improved products, we are often able to obtain patent protection for our innovations, which is indicative of our technical capabilities and creativity. Although we do not consider any single patent to be material to our business, we believe that, in the aggregate, our patents and other intellectual property provide us with a competitive advantage. At December 31, 2016, we have approximately 444 domestic and foreign patents outstanding and approximately 67 pending patent applications. Our patents and patent applications cover approximately 62 different inventions. Some of our competitors license our technology in exchange for royalty payments, although such licensing does not represent a material amount of our business. Research and development expenses totaled $7.1 million in 2016, $7.4 million in 2015 and $7.9 million 2014, and were approximately 1.5%, 1.6% and 1.5% of our net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Production
Machine Clothing Production Process
The following diagram represents the machine clothing production process.

 The machine clothing production process begins with the spinning of synthetic fiber threads to produce yarn, which is then twisted in preparation for the manufacturing of machine clothing. Yarn, which companies sometimes purchase as a raw material, is then wound on large spools prior to installation on the loom. The yarn is drawn through needles in preparation for weaving.
9

With the yarn prepared for weaving, a weave pattern can be installed in the loom controller. The nature of the weave pattern is critical to how the machine clothing performs in the paper-making process. The yarn is then woven to the desired length.
Technological advancements have resulted in weaving becoming an almost entirely automated process. Following weaving of a forming or dryer fabric, the two ends are permanently joined to form a continuous loop of machine clothing. Although significant automation has occurred in the joining process, it remains the most labor intensive element of the machine clothing production process.
Press felts are woven in a continuous loop and undergo a process that is not necessary for forming and dryer fabrics. An additional layer of fibers is added to the outside surface with the use of an advanced needling machine, such that a very smooth felt surface is created.
All machine clothing then undergoes heat setting and chemical treating. Heat setting tightens the machine clothing giving it the necessary mechanical properties for the paper-making process. Finally, the machine clothing is meticulously inspected prior to being shipped to the customer.
The machine clothing production process is capital intensive and requires a variety of equipment, including warping equipment, weaving looms, heat set equipment, joining equipment, needle looms and finishing machines.
Roll Cover Production Process
The following diagram represents the roll covering production process.
The covering on the rolls used in the paper-making process wear over time and must be periodically replaced for the roll to function properly. Rolls are removed from the paper-making machine and delivered to one of our facilities for re-covering. During this time, a spare roll is placed in the paper machine to enable continuous operations.
The roll covering process begins with the removal of the old cover. A lathe and belt grinder are used to remove the old cover, exposing the roll shell. The shell is cleaned with a pressure washer and blasted with solid particles to increase the shell’s surface area for bonding of the new cover. Following the blasting process, the shell is ready to be re-covered.
The shell is then coated with proprietary bonding agents that affix the new roll cover to the shell. Each type of cover material is applied with a different process. Rubber and composite covers are extruded in a slow spinning lathe. Polyurethane covers are typically cast on the core using a mold, and ceramic covering is expelled onto the shell at high pressure.
Following application of the core material, the cover undergoes a curing process. Rubber covers are cured for 12 to 28 hours in vulcanizers under high temperature and pressure, whereas polyurethane and composite materials are cured in a hot air oven. After curing, the roll cover is ground with belts and grinding stones. Depending on the type of roll, a proprietary pattern of holes and grooves is then drilled into the cover to aid in water removal. Finally, the roll is balanced for proper spinning motion and meticulously checked for quality before being returned to the customer.
The roll cover production process is capital intensive and requires a variety of equipment, including lathes, belt grinders, polyurethane casting molds (for polyurethane roll covers), extruders, mix stations, vulcanizers, ovens and balancing equipment.
Raw Materials
The primary raw materials used in our machine clothing production are synthetic yarns and fibers. The primary raw materials used in our roll cover products are synthetic and natural rubber, monomers, epoxy resins and polyurethane. A number of suppliers provide the materials used in our product lines, so availability has not posed a significant concern. Since both the machine clothing and primary roll cover materials are based on petroleum and natural gas derivatives, their prices are subject to changes in supply/demand and the price of petroleum and natural gas and their derivatives. The global average price for petroleum bottomed out one year ago and has almost doubled to $53/barrel since then. The U.S. Energy Information 
10

Administration’s latest forecast is for pricing to remain at this level throughout 2017. We have recently seen the impact of this rise in energy prices, coupled with supply/demand issues of certain raw materials, causing an increase in certain synthetic yarn materials, as well as synthetic rubber. It is expected that these increases will abate as we head towards Q3 2017. Natural Rubber prices tend to be influenced directly by the weather in the Asian crop regions and by demand in China. This winter has been especially difficult in Asia with long-lasting rains, causing a temporary price increase in Natural Rubber. Pricing is expected to rescind towards mid-year. Xerium mitigates these impacts by placing blanket orders ahead of the winter while prices are lower. 

Environmental
Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of national, state and local laws and regulations protecting the environment and human health in the United States and foreign countries that govern, among other things, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, discharges of pollutants into the air and water and workplace safety. Because of our operations, the history of industrial uses at some of our facilities, the operations of predecessor owners or operators of some of the businesses, and the use and release of hazardous substances at these sites, the liability provisions of environmental laws may affect us.
We believe that any liability in excess of amounts provided in Note 9 "Commitments and Contingencies" to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements which may result from the resolution of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or cash flow.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2016 we had approximately 2,950 employees worldwide, of which approximately 67% were manufacturing employees. As of December 31, 2016, 2,010, or 68%, of our employees are members of labor unions, trade unions, employee associations or workers councils. We believe that we have good relations with our employees and the various groups that represent our employees.
