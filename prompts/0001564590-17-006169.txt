ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Company Overview
 We are a pure play wood fibre processing company with three core businesses: contract wood handling and chipping services, the manufacture and sale of wood pellets for the U.S. heating market and the manufacture, aggregation and sale of wood pellets for the utility and industrial power generation market.
 Our wood handling and chipping services business includes Fulghum, which operates 31 wood chipping mills in the United States and South America. Fulghum provides wood yard operations services and wood fibre processing services, and sells wood chips to the pulp, paper and packaging industry. Fulghum’s South American subsidiaries own and manage forestland and sell bark to industrial consumers. 
 Our U.S. wood pellet business consists of NEWP, which is one of the largest producers of wood pellets for the United States residential and commercial heating markets. NEWP operates four wood pellet facilities in the Northeast. The facilities are located in Jaffrey, New Hampshire; Deposit, New York; Schuyler, New York; and Youngsville, Pennsylvania.
 Our Canadian wood pellet business consists of our wood pellet production facilities located in Atikokan, Ontario, or the Atikokan Facility, and in Wawa, Ontario, or the Wawa Facility, the latter of which we idled in 2017. Wood pellets produced at the Atikokan Facility are being used primarily for utility power generation in Canada and wood pellets produced at the Wawa Facility were used primarily for utility power generation in the United Kingdom. 
 Idling of Wawa Facility; Exploration of Strategic Alternatives
 In February 2017, we announced that we have (i) decided to idle the Wawa Facility and (ii) reduced production at the Atikokan Facility, to levels necessary to only fulfill the delivery requirements under the ten-year take-or-pay contract, or the OPG Contract, with Ontario Power Generation, or OPG. These decisions result from many factors, including without limitation, continued difficulty with ramping up production and additional capital required to increase production to levels near the Wawa Facility’s design capacity, projected operating costs that exceed our original expectations and uncertainty around future profitability. Due to the challenges, we recorded net asset impairment charges for the Wawa Facility and the Atikokan Facility totaling $116.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 In addition, we initiated a formal process to explore a variety of strategic alternatives for the Wawa Facility and the Company as a whole. In conjunction with this process and to address potential future liquidity needs, we are considering strategic alternatives that may include, but are not limited to, a sale of us, a merger or other business combination, a sale of all or a material portion of our assets or a recapitalization. 
 We have retained Wells Fargo Securities, LLC to assist in the strategic alternatives review process. There is no assurance that the strategic review process will result in a transaction. If an appropriate strategic alternative is not achieved on a timely basis, and if we were otherwise unable to secure additional sources of funds to address potential future liquidity needs, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.   
 Wood Fibre Business Cost Savings Plan and Other Corporate Activities
 Over the past 18 months, we have been reorganizing our businesses to lower our cost structure. We now expect to achieve total consolidated annual selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expense savings of approximately $20 million, up from the $12 to $15 million we previously expected. We have completed restructuring actions that have resulted in approximately $13.6 million of consolidated SG&A expense savings in 2016, excluding approximately $2.6 million of reorganization and transaction costs. We expect to achieve the additional savings of approximately $6.5 million in 2017, excluding reorganization and transaction costs. 
 These savings were achieved primarily by reducing corporate staff by approximately 30%, reducing compensation, and moving corporate headquarters and several back office positions from Los Angeles, California to lower-cost locations on the East Coast. We are continuing to identify further actions to reduce SG&A expenses in response to our financial position or changes to our corporate structure resulting from the strategic alternatives review process.
 Results at NEWP this year were negatively impacted by relatively warmer weather than in previous years, continuing depressed prices for competitor heating fuels such as heating oil and propane, and changes in consumer buying patterns. As a result, NEWP’s sales volumes were significantly lower than historical levels. NEWP’s revenue decreased from $54.3 million for the year ended 
 
4

December 31, 2015 to $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. NEWP’s gross profit decreased from $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. In response to market conditions, NEWP began scaling back production in February 2016. NEWP produced at approximately 65% of capacity during 2016 and is currently monitoring market demand and inventory levels and will adjust production accordingly. 
 Fulghum’s revenue was $97.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $94.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Fulghum’s gross profit was $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In February 2017, Fulghum was notified by a customer of its intent to exercise its purchase option on two of Fulghum’s mills. Fulghum expects the loss of these mills to negatively impact operating income and cash flow in the second half of 2017 and going forward. In 2016, these mills contributed approximately $3 million of operating income. Fulghum incurred capital expenditures of approximately $0.5 million for these two mills in 2016. If the sale of the mills is consummated, we expect to receive a one-time cash payment of approximately $5.5 million. While this was a subsequent event, the delays and extended negotiations during the three months ended December 31, 2016 and leading up to the customer’s final decision were considered a triggering event to perform a two-step goodwill impairment test for Fulghum U.S. as of December 31, 2016. The analysis of goodwill indicated an impairment to goodwill of $11.7 million, which was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016.  
 Sales of Pasadena Holdings and RNP
 On March 14, 2016, RNP, a majority owned subsidiary of which we previously owned approximately 60%, completed the sale of Rentech Nitrogen Pasadena Holdings, LLC, or Pasadena Holdings, the owner of a fertilizer facility in Pasadena, Texas, or the Pasadena Facility, to Interoceanic Corporation, or IOC. The transaction, referred to herein as the Pasadena Sale, included an initial cash payment of $5.0 million and a post-closing cash working capital adjustment of $5.4 million. The total of these payments along with insurance refunds put the total distribution to RNP unitholders at approximately $10.7 million of which we received $6.0 million. The Pasadena Sale also includes a milestone payment which would be paid to former RNP unitholders equal to 50% of the facility’s EBITDA, as defined in the purchase agreement, in excess of $8.0 million cumulatively earned over two years.
 On April 1, 2016, RNP completed the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 9, 2015, or the Merger Agreement, under which RNP and the General Partner merged with affiliates of CVR, and RNP ceased to be a publicly traded company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CVR, or the Merger. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding unit of RNP was exchanged for 1.04 common units of CVR, or CVR Common Units, and $2.57 of cash. We received merger consideration of $59.8 million of cash and 24.2 million CVR Common Units. We used 17.0 million CVR Common Units received in the Merger and $10.0 million of cash to: (i) repurchase and retire all $100 million of our Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $10.00 per share, or the Preferred Stock, held by certain funds managed by or affiliated with GSO Capital Partners LP, or the GSO Funds, and (ii) repay approximately $41.7 million of debt under our credit agreement with the GSO Funds (such agreement as amended and amended and restated from time to time, the “GSO Credit Agreement”). 
 Our Businesses
 Our Wood Fibre Processing Business
 Our wood fibre processing business primarily consists of wood chipping services to the pulp, paper and packaging industry and wood pellet production for the utility and industrial power generation market and the residential and commercial heating markets.
Our Wood Chipping Business — Fulghum Fibres
 Fulghum provides wood yard operations services and high-quality wood chipping services, and produces and sells wood chips to the pulp, paper and packaging industry. In South America, Fulghum manufactures and sells wood chips, processes and sells biomass fuel to industrial heat and utility customers, owns and manages forestland, and buys and trades wood chips. Fulghum provides services and sells to customers in the United States, South America and Asia. Fulghum and its subsidiaries operate 31 wood chipping mills, of which 26 are located in the United States, four are located in Chile and one is located in Uruguay. Fulghum owns 86% of the equity interest in the subsidiaries located in Chile and Uruguay.
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, our mills in the United States processed 11.4 million green metric tons, or GMT, of logs into wood chips and residual fuels; our mills in South America processed 2.8 million GMT of logs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our mills in the United States processed 12.5 million GMT of logs into wood chips and residual fuels; our mills in South America processed 2.6 million GMT of logs.
 In February 2017, Fulghum received notice from one of its customers that it intends to exercise its contractual right, under their processing agreement, to purchase two of Fulghum’s mills. We expect the loss of the Fulghum contract to negatively impact Fulghum’s operating income in the second half of 2017 and going forward. If the purchase option is indeed exercised, Fulghum 
 
5

expects to receive a one-time cash payment of approximately $5.5 million in connection with the purchase. Fulghum continues to focus on efficiently operating its remaining 24 mills in the U.S. and 5 mills in South America and explore opportunities to generate additional cash flow. 
 Expansion Projects
 From time to time, we evaluate and pursue opportunities to increase our profitability by expanding our chip mills’ production capacities and product offerings. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we had no such expansion projects.
 Services/Products
 Service revenues represent revenues earned under agreements for wood fibre processing services and wood yard operations. Product revenues represent revenues earned by our Chilean operations from the sale of wood chips and bark. Our operations include: managing industrial scale wood yards; debarking and chipping of logs; and screening and storing of chips and bark.
 Customers
 The majority of Fulghum’s customers are large pulp, paper and packaging manufacturers who use wood chips from our mills to manufacture products such as: boxboard, containerboard, fluff, kraftliner, dissolving pulp, paper and medium density fiberboard for building products.
 Fulghum generates revenue primarily from fees under exclusive processing agreements. Each of our United States mills typically operates under an exclusive processing agreement with a single customer. At these mills, Fulghum is paid a processing fee based on tons processed, with minimum volume base rates and a reduced fee rate for higher volumes. In most cases, if the customer fails to deliver the minimum contracted log volume for processing, it must pay a shortage fee to Fulghum, which is typically lower than the base rate. Under our processing agreements, the customer generally has the opportunity to make up for any shortfall below minimum volume requirements with additional volumes in subsequent months before it is required to pay a shortfall fee. Shortfall fees are typically settled quarterly. Fulghum’s Chilean operations include chipping services that earn fees based on a per ton processing fee structure similar to that described above. Fulghum’s Chilean operations also involve the sale of wood chips for export and the local sale of bark for industrial heat and utility applications. In Chile, we purchase raw material and sell products through two subsidiaries. Forestal Los Andes S.A., or FLA, purchases logs from the market to fulfill an order from a customer that is typically for a specific vessel of wood chips. Forestal Pacifico S.A., or FP, provides de-barking services for FLA and several of our customers. FP processes bark into a biomass fuel that is sold to local power utilities and industrial customers for heat and electricity applications. We also operate one mill in Uruguay under a chipping services-for-fee contract.
 Most of our mills operate under multi-year contracts with the majority of total processing volume contracted through 2018 with some continuing beyond 2018 until 2028. Six mills in the United States representing over 40% of our United States volume and three mills in Chile representing over 70% of our South American volume are under contract through 2018 and beyond. Seven of our mills located in the United States and two of our mills located in South America have contracts that are currently renegotiated annually. One of our mills located in the United States provides wood chips to its customer on an as-needed basis on the spot market. We own 19 of the 31 mills we operate in the United States and South America. For certain of the mills that we own, the customer has an option to purchase the mill for a pre-determined price. In each scenario, the purchase price for the mill exceeds any debt remaining on the facility. For each of the mills that we do not own but operate under an agreement with the customer, the customer can terminate the agreement with prior written notice (in most cases, the processing agreements require 90 days’ prior written notice). 
 During 2016, approximately 71% of the log volume we processed in the United States was for four customers at 19 mills, as listed below.
 
 
Customer | Number of Mills | | % of United States Volume
---------------------------+-----------------+---+--------------------------
WestRock | | 8 | | 20 | %
Graphic Packaging | | 2 | | 19 | %
International Paper | | 8 | | 17 | %
Packaging Corp. of America | | 1 | | 15 | %

Seasonality and Volatility
 Our wood chipping mills typically operate throughout the year; however, there may be quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in processing revenue at individual mills. These fluctuations are usually due to variations in customer-controlled deliveries of logs, 
 
6

production levels at customers’ mills, maintenance requirements, and/or weather-related events. Our customer contracts typically stipulate minimum volume requirements and shortfall fees. Such fees partially mitigate volatility in revenues of our United States mills. When seasonal precipitation is expected to prevent deliveries or make deliveries of logs to the mills difficult, our customers frequently coordinate delivery schedules to build log inventories in advance of such conditions. Building sufficient inventory of logs at our mills enables Fulghum to process logs with few interruptions during the rainy season. Based on our customers’ expected relatively continuous wood chip requirements, the terms of our processing agreements and our customers’ focus on maintaining proper log inventories, we do not expect to experience material seasonality in Fulghum’s United States or Uruguayan operations. However, one of our mills in Chile typically ceases wood chip processing operations for one to two months during its winter season due to the customer’s inability to harvest and deliver logs to the facility. Since a significant portion of the revenue in Fulghum’s South American operations is derived from the sale of wood chips, primarily for export from Chile, an interruption in the supply of logs could adversely affect revenue and profitability. The export portion of Fulghum’s revenues, and the associated profits, may be more variable than the revenue and profits derived from processing fees pursuant to long-term contracts.
 Raw Materials
 The customers of our 26 mills located in the United States and the customers of most of our five mills in Chile and Uruguay are responsible for the procurement and delivery of wood to our mills. As a result, these mills are not directly exposed to logistics or delivery risks or to market risk associated with potential changes in wood supply or pricing, although they may be indirectly impacted if a customer is adversely impacted by these risks. For service revenue generated under our processing contracts where the customer is responsible for providing the logs, title to the wood remains with the customer throughout our receipt and processing of the wood fibre. In Chile, in addition to providing wood processing services, we sell wood chips primarily for export to Asian markets. We primarily purchase logs only to fulfill obligations under contracts with established prices for the delivery of wood chips, thereby minimizing our exposure to market fluctuations in prices for wood chips and logs. We also own approximately 1,400 acres of forestland in South America that can be harvested in cases of high log prices, which can help reduce market exposure in the short-term. However, if prices of wood remain at high levels for a prolonged period of time, revenue and profitability of our Chilean operations, which sell wood chips, could be adversely affected.
Transportation
 In the United States, Fulghum’s customers are responsible for delivering logs to the respective Fulghum chipping facility and arranging transportation of the processed wood chips from the mill to the final destination, except at those mills which are within or adjacent to customers’ premises, where wood chips are delivered by conveyor. Our Uruguayan and certain of our Chilean operations are similar to the United States business model in that the customer is responsible for delivering logs to the wood chipping facility and either takes receipt of the wood chips from the mill (domestic customers) or requires Fulghum to load the wood chips into a ship for export at the customer’s expense (foreign customers).
Competition
 While a significant portion of the wood chipping mills in the United States are integrated facilities (i.e. owned and operated by pulp and paper companies that produce wood chips for internal consumption), the number of contract wood chipping mills in the United States has grown over the last decade. We estimate that Fulghum has a significant market share of the contract wood chipping market in the United States. We continue to explore opportunities to expand our business. We believe that most of the other contract wood chip processors in the United States that compete with Fulghum are smaller and less experienced and recognized than Fulghum. We believe that Fulghum’s 27 years of operating experience in the wood handling and chip processing industry, level of expertise and efficiency, scale, brand recognition and quality of services have enabled us, and will continue to enable us, to favorably distinguish ourselves from these competitors.
Our Wood Pellet Business — Industrial
 Our board of directors, or Board, decided to idle the Wawa Facility in February 2017 due to equipment and operational issues that would require additional unbudgeted capital investment. Its decision is also the consequence of the continued uncertainty around the profitability on pellets produced at the facility and sold under the ten-year take-or-pay contract, or the Drax Contract, with Drax Power Limited, or Drax, making any additional investment in the facility uneconomic for us. Idling the facility will allow us to conserve cash to preserve our liquidity as we formally explore strategic alternatives for the Wawa Facility, including ongoing discussions with third parties.
 Our Wawa Facility had experienced equipment and operating challenges subsequent to the replacement of problematic conveyors that was completed last fall. These issues have persisted. Our Board’s decision was based in part on our review of the work by a third-party engineering firm to identify additional necessary capital improvements. While we believe that the issues we have been 
 
7

experiencing at the facility can be resolved with additional capital investments, we have concluded that it is not economical for Rentech to pursue those investments or to continue to operate the facility at this time given the Drax Contract.  
 As a result of this decision, the Wawa Facility operations team completed a safe and orderly idling of the facility. While the facility is idled, a small workforce remains in place to maintain the facility so that it can resume operations with minimal cost and time if there is interest from a third party to invest in or purchase the facility. The remainder of the workforce has been placed on a temporary layoff while options for the facility are explored.
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, we shipped four vessels to Drax containing approximately 134,000 metric tons of wood pellets. During 2017, we shipped one vessel to Drax containing approximately 45,800 metric tons of wood pellets. At the time the Wawa Facility was idled, there were approximately 12,000 metric tons of wood pellets in storage. We are currently looking at various options for this inventory. 
 Our Atikokan Facility was designed to produce approximately 110,000 metric tons of wood pellets annually at full capacity, and has successfully operated at rates of approximately 90% of production capacity. We plan to reduce production at the Atikokan Facility to a rate of approximately 45,000 metric tons of wood pellets on an annualized basis to fulfill the delivery requirements under the OPG Contract. The Atikokan Facility shipped approximately 50,000 metric tons of wood pellets to OPG, during the year ended December 31, 2016. At this time, we no longer expect to produce additional pellets to send to the Port of Quebec to fulfill the Drax Contract. We continue to explore additional opportunities to increase sales volumes at the Atikokan Facility that would enable the facility to increase both production and profitability. We are currently holding back approximately $3.5 million of capital expenditures budgeted for conveyance modifications at the Atikokan Facility. These expenditures along with any additional investments deemed necessary to help the facility reach full capacity will continue to be considered and evaluated for economic justification.
 Products
 Our industrial wood pellets are used in larger scale power generation facilities. Our wood pellets are subject to specific product quality standards, which include energy density, ash content, durability index, fines content, chemical content and grindability as both electric utilities and government regulators have established standards for wood pellets used in renewable energy. Proof of biomass sustainability and independent verification of feedstock supply are also requirements to sell wood pellets to European utilities.
Customers
 In 2013, our subsidiary that owns the Wawa Facility (the “Wawa Company”) entered into the Drax Contract, which originally called for annual wood pellet deliveries of 400,000 metric tons from the Wawa Facility beginning in 2016. Due to the issues we experienced in ramp-up and commissioning of the facility, the Wawa Company amended the Drax Contract to adjust the required delivery quantities to reflect expected delays in production at the Wawa Facility. The amendments resulted in contract adjustments for reduced volumes in 2014 through 2017, including penalty payments from the Wawa Company to Drax for delivery shortfalls in 2014 and 2015. 
 The Wawa Company delivered approximately 134,000 metric tons of pellets to Drax in 2016. The Wawa Facility did not incur penalties in 2016 for the shortfall in delivered pellets from the originally contracted volumes because the spot market prices for wood pellets were less than the contracted price with Drax. The Wawa Facility has not made any additional shipments to Drax since January 2017, and its remaining inventory of approximately 12,000 metric tons of pellets is not sufficient to fill a vessel to ship to Drax in the near term. 
 Prior to our decision to idle the facility, the Wawa Company agreed to deliver approximately 336,000 metric tons to Drax in 2017. In January 2017 we shipped 48,000 metric tons of pellets to Drax and in March 2017, Drax and the Wawa Company agreed to cancel the next two shipments of 2017 without any penalties, leaving the Wawa Company with an obligation to deliver approximately 193,000 metric tons to Drax later in the year. Further amendments to the delivery schedule under the Drax Contract may occur based on the Wawa Company’s determination to idle the facility. At this time we cannot make a determination if any penalties will be associated with future changes to the contract; under the Drax Contract, any potential penalties would depend upon whether Drax incurs additional fees and expenses in connection with finding replacement pellets. Such penalties could include, without limit, an inability of Drax to fulfill its replacement pellet needs at an equal or lesser price than the Drax Contract price. Rentech, Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of the Wawa Company under the terms of the Drax Contract up to a maximum amount of CAD$20 million, including potential penalty payments.
 Our subsidiary that owns the Atikokan Facility (the “Atikokan Company”) entered into the OPG Contract in June 2013 under which it is required to deliver 45,000 metric tons of wood pellets annually. OPG has the option to increase required delivery of wood 
 
8

pellets from the Atikokan Facility up to 90,000 metric tons annually. During 2016, we delivered an additional 5,000 metric tons at OPG’s request for a total of 50,000 metric tons of wood pellets.
Seasonality and Volatility
 We do not expect significant seasonality in our revenue from our Atikokan Facility. We have entered into a long-term off-take contract with OPG, which is a power utility company that operates throughout the year subject to maintenance shutdowns. We have been producing wood pellets from this facility year-round to meet the contractual requirements. Ground conditions during the wet season referred to as “spring break-up” or “snow melt”, may prevent or curtail the harvesting of wood limiting the supply of fibre for wood pellet production. We expect that our wood pellet mills will build sufficient wood inventory on site through the autumn and winter months to mitigate this potential interruption of wood supply. This inventory build-up may increase our working capital requirements.
Raw Materials and Supply
 We intend to utilize Crown Fibre as the primary feedstock at our industrial wood pellet facilities. We believe that using Crown Fibre is desirable due to Ontario’s long-term forest management regime, which supports the availability and supply of wood fibre, and its industry-leading sustainability practices. In addition, we believe that the mixed hardwood trees in Northern Ontario, which have a long maturity period before they can be harvested, have a natural chemical composition that allows for the production of high quality wood pellets for thermal applications. We also use sawmill wood residuals and other sources of biomass, from time to time, as part of the feedstock for the Atikokan Facility.
Transportation
 We have a contract with Canadian National Railway Company, or the Canadian National Contract, for all rail transportation of wood pellets from the Atikokan Facility to the Port of Quebec. The Atikokan Facility is located 1,300 track miles from the Port of Quebec. The contract requires we transport a minimum of 3,600 rail carloads each year. If these minimums are not met, the Wawa Company could be subject to penalties in the amount of CAD$1,000 per rail car. Under the Canadian National Contract, Rentech, Inc. has provided a parent guarantee which is capped at CAD$1.5 million. During 2015 and 2016 we incurred and either paid or accrued for penalties of $3.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively.  
 The Wawa Company has entered into a contract with Quebec Stevedoring Company Limited, or QSL, for our exclusive use of railcar unloading services, pellet storage domes and ship loading services at the Port of Quebec. The contract has a capital lease section which stipulates a fixed monthly payment to cover QSL for a portion of their cost to build the facility and a service section which includes rates for services and a pass-through of some cost actually incurred at the port. Under the contract, Rentech, Inc. has provided a parent guarantee for the monthly capital lease payments under the agreement. The remaining amount due under the capital lease is approximately $13.5 million at December 31, 2016.
 Joint Venture with Graanul 
 In connection with our acquisition of Fulghum, or the Fulghum Acquisition, we entered into a joint venture with Graanul Invest AS, or Graanul, a European producer of wood pellets, for the potential development and construction of, and investment in, wood pellet plants in the United States and Canada. We and Graanul each own 50% equity interests in the joint venture, or the Rentech/Graanul JV, which is accounted for under the equity method. The Rentech/Graanul JV owns neither our Atikokan Facility nor our Wawa Facility. The joint venture has the right to develop certain wood pellet-related projects and has certain rights as exercised by either member to participate in future wood pellet projects or acquisitions in North America sourced by the other member. The joint venture currently does not own any tangible assets and its impact on our financial statements is immaterial. 
Our Wood Pellet Business — NEWP
 NEWP operates four wood pellet processing facilities with a combined annual production capacity of approximately 300,000 short tons. The facilities are located in Jaffrey, New Hampshire; Deposit, New York; Schuyler, New York; and Youngsville, Pennsylvania.
Products
 NEWP’s wood pellets, which are designed to have low moisture and ash content, are used in commercial and residential heating applications.
 
9

Customers
 NEWP’s facilities and customers are located in the Northeastern United States. NEWP sells its wood pellets to big-box retailers and specialty retailers, including lawn and garden centers, heating supply stores, hardware stores, markets and convenience stores. It also sells pellets in bulk to large institutions, including schools, universities and governmental agencies to heat buildings. In the aggregate, NEWP’s top two big-box retailers, Lowe’s Home Improvement and Tractor Supply Company, represented approximately 25% of NEWP’s total sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. As is typical in the retail wood pellet industry, NEWP’s sales to its customers are primarily made on a purchase order basis, and NEWP generally does not have long-term orders or commitments.
Seasonality and Volatility
 Since NEWP’s wood pellets are used for heating, its sales are seasonal. We typically ship the highest volume of wood pellets from our NEWP facilities during the third and fourth quarters of each year. During fiscal years 2015 and 2016, approximately 56% and 75%, respectively, of NEWP’s total annual volumes were shipped in the second half of the year. As a result of the seasonality of shipments and sales, we expect to experience significant fluctuations in NEWP’s revenues, income and net working capital levels from quarter to quarter. Weather conditions can significantly impact quarterly results by affecting the timing and amount of product demand and deliveries. To accommodate NEWP’s seasonal sales, we build up NEWP’s finished goods inventory from March through August of each year. This inventory build-up typically increases our working capital requirements.
 The abnormally warm temperatures during the winter a year ago have disrupted seasonal buying patterns of the last couple of years resulting in unusually low sales volumes during the year ended December 31, 2016. Customers who have historically bought wood pellets earlier in the spring, summer and fall in preparation for the upcoming winter season are now waiting to make their purchases on an as-needed basis. As a result, we expect incremental seasonality in our revenue. While the consumer buying patterns may continue in 2017, we believe that these patterns are temporary, and we expect consumer buying patterns and sales to return to historical trends and levels, respectively. In response to market conditions, NEWP began scaling back production in February 2016. NEWP produced at approximately 65% of capacity during 2016 and is currently monitoring market demand and inventory levels and will adjust production accordingly.
 Raw Materials
 Wood feedstock (wood chips and sawdust) represents the largest component of NEWP’s wood pellet product cost. Competition for wood feedstock supply from pulp, paper and packaging manufacturing, and commercial and institutional wood boiler heating systems may affect our cost of wood feedstock. Our Jaffrey, New Hampshire production facility is affected the most by this competition, followed by our Schuyler, New York production facility, with our Deposit, New York production facility and our wood pellet processing facility located in Youngsville, Pennsylvania, or the Allegheny Facility, least affected. We have approximately 184 wood suppliers, of which approximately 74 provide 80% of our wood feedstock needs. We have developed relationships with our suppliers such that our wood costs have remained relatively flat with minimal variability over the last several years.
Transportation
 NEWP’s customers take delivery of the wood pellets at the applicable facility.
 Environmental Matters
 Our business is subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, provincial, state and local, environmental, health and safety regulations governing a wide range of matters, including the emission of air pollutants, the release of hazardous substances into the environment, occupational health and safety, handling, use and transportation of our products, wood fibre feedstock, and other substances that are part of our operations. These laws, their underlying regulatory requirements and the enforcement thereof may impact us by imposing:

• | restrictions on operations or the need to install enhanced or additional controls, including to address air emissions, discharges to water, or new or changed permit requirements or, to mitigate or remediate releases of hazardous or other substances from our operations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the need to obtain, maintain and comply with permits and authorizations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | liability for releases, emissions or discharges at current and former facilities and off-site waste disposal locations, including releases that have or had the potential to contaminate soil or groundwater.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

10

These laws also affect our operating activities as well as the level of our operating costs and capital expenditures. Failure to comply with environmental laws, including the permits issued to us thereunder, generally could result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions, court orders to install pollution-control equipment, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. 
Our operations require numerous permits and authorizations. A decision by a governmental regulator to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or authorization could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the impacted facility.
 In addition, environmental, health and safety laws may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup of a contaminated site on current owners and operators of the site, former owners and operators of the site at the time of the disposal of the hazardous substances, any person who arranges for the transportation, disposal or treatment of the hazardous substances, and the transporters who select the disposal and treatment facilities, regardless of the care exercised by such persons. Private parties, including the owners of properties adjacent to other facilities where our wastes are taken for disposal, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. Under environmental laws such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and state analogs, former owners and operators of facilities can be held responsible for investigating and remediating environmental contamination.
The laws and regulations to which we are subject are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. The ultimate impact on our business of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that our operations may change over time and certain implementing regulations for laws, such as the CAA, have not yet been finalized, are under governmental or judicial review or are being revised. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs.
 Our facilities have experienced some level of regulatory scrutiny in the past, and we may be subject to further regulatory inspections, future requests for investigation or assertions of liability relating to environmental issues or accidental spills or releases. In the future, we could incur material liabilities or costs related to environmental matters, and these environmental liabilities or costs (including fines or other sanctions) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
 Certain environmental regulations and risks associated with our business are outlined below. We strive to maintain compliance with these regulations; however, they are complex and varied, and our operations are heavily regulated, and we may, from time to time, fall out of compliance, which may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
 The Federal Clean Air Act, or the CAA. The CAA and its implementing regulations, as well as the corresponding state laws and regulations that regulate emissions of pollutants into the air, impose permitting and emission control requirements relating to specific air pollutants, as well as the requirement to maintain a risk management program to help prevent accidental releases of certain substances. Standards promulgated pursuant to the CAA may require that we install controls at or make other changes to our facilities. If new controls or changes to operations are needed, the costs could be significant. In addition, failure to comply with the requirements of the CAA and its implementing regulations could result in substantial fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions.
 The regulation of air emissions under the CAA requires that we obtain various construction and operating permits, including in some cases, Title V air permits and incur capital expenditures for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at our facilities. Measures have been taken to comply with various regulations specific to our operations, such as National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants, New Source Performance Standards and New Source Review. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial administrative and capital expenditures to maintain compliance with these and other air emission regulations that have been promulgated or may be promulgated or revised in the future.
 Release Reporting. The release of hazardous substances or extremely hazardous substances into the environment is subject to release reporting requirements under federal and state environmental laws, including the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. We occasionally experience releases of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances from our operations or properties. If we fail to properly report a release, or if the release violates the law or our permits, it could cause us to become the subject of a governmental enforcement action or third-party claims. Government enforcement or third-party claims relating to releases of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances could result in significant expenditures and liability.
 Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. In addition, the Clean Water Act and 
 
11

analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters by a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
 Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions (including CO2, methane and N2O) are in various phases of discussion or implementation. At the federal legislative level, Congress has previously considered legislation requiring a mandatory reduction of GHG emissions. Although Congressional passage of such legislation does not appear imminent at this time, it could be adopted at a future date. It is also possible that Congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency or impose a carbon fee.
 Management of Hazardous Substances and Contamination. Under CERCLA and related state laws, certain persons may be liable at sites where or from release or threatened release of hazardous substances has occurred or is threatened. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where a release or threatened release occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the release occurred, and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability under CERCLA is strict, retroactive and, under certain circumstances, joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances. RCRA regulates the generation, treatment, storage, handling, transportation and disposal of solid waste and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. Under RCRA, persons may be liable at sites where the past or present storage, handling, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where disposal occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the disposal occurred, and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability under RCRA is strict and, under certain circumstances, joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances. As is the case with all companies engaged in similar industries, depending on the underlying facts and circumstances we face potential exposure from future claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters, including soil and water contamination, personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances that we manufactured, handled, used, stored, transported, spilled, disposed of or released. We cannot assure you that we will not become involved in future proceedings related to our release of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances or that, if we were held responsible for damages in any existing or future proceedings, such costs would be covered by insurance or would not be material. These damages can relate to our current operating sites, as well as business and operating sites that we have divested, including without limitation the fertilizer plants that our former subsidiaries own in East Dubuque, Illinois and Pasadena, Texas. For a discussion of continuing environmental liabilities, that could have a material adverse effect on our business and cash flow see the risk factors captioned “Our wood fibre processing business is subject to environmental laws and regulations.” and “We may incur costs to investigate and remediate known or suspected contamination at the Pasadena Facility, or to close the phosphogypsum stacks located at the Pasadena Facility in compliance with environmental laws”.
Environmental Insurance. We have a premises pollution liability insurance policy which covers third party bodily injury and property damages claims, remediation costs and associated legal defense expenses for pollution conditions at or migrating from our facilities and the transportation risks associated with moving waste from our facilities to offsite locations for unloading or depositing waste. The policy also covers business interruptions and non-owned disposal sites. Our policy is subject to a limit and self-insured retention and contains other terms, exclusions, conditions and limitations that could apply to a particular pollution condition claim, and we cannot guarantee that a claim will be adequately insured for all potential damages.
Safety, Health and Security Matters
 We are subject to a number of federal, provincial and state laws and regulations in the United States and Canada related to safety, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, the Occupational Health and Safety Regulations, the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act, and comparable Canadian, provincial and state statutes and regulations, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. Various OSHA standards may apply to our operations, including standards concerning notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work, the handling of asbestos and asbestos-containing materials, installation and operations of electrical equipment in a wood dust environment, and worker training and emergency response programs. We also are subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. These regulations apply to any process that involves a chemical at or above the specified thresholds or any process that involves flammable liquid or gas, pressurized tanks, caverns and wells in excess of 10,000 pounds at various locations. We have an internal safety, health and security program designed to monitor and enforce compliance with worker safety requirements. We also are subject to EPA Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, known as the Risk Management Plan requirements, which are designed to prevent the accidental release of toxic, reactive, 
 
12

flammable or explosive materials, and the United States Coast Guard’s Maritime Security Standards for Facilities, which are designed to regulate the security of high-risk maritime facilities.
