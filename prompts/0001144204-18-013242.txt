--------+---------

Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc.
 
Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. (or the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation. On July 14, 2010, Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. completed its conversion from the mutual holding company structure and the related public offering and is now a stock holding company that is fully owned by the public. Jacksonville Savings Bank (or the “Bank”) is 100% owned by the Company and the Company is 100% owned by public stockholders. On June 28, 2013, Jacksonville Savings Bank terminated its election to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company pursuant to Section 10(l) of the Home Owners Loan Act. On this same date, Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. became a bank holding company. 
 
On January 18, 2018, the Company announced the signing of a merger agreement under which CNB Bank Shares, Inc. will acquire the Company in an all-cash transaction for total consideration valued at approximately $61.6 million. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions contained in the merger agreement, including the approval of the merger agreement by the Company’s stockholders and the receipt of required regulatory approvals, CNB Bank Shares and the Company expect that the merger will be completed during the second quarter of 2018. However, it is possible that factors outside the control of both companies, including whether or when the required regulatory approvals will be received, could result in the merger being completed at a different time or not at all.
 
The Company’s only significant asset is its investment in Jacksonville Savings Bank. At December 31, 2017, Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. had consolidated assets of $325.0 million, total deposits of $252.7 million, and stockholders’ equity of $48.8 million.
 
Jacksonville Savings Bank
 
Jacksonville Savings Bank is an Illinois-chartered savings bank headquartered in Jacksonville, Illinois. We conduct our business from our main office and five branches, two of which are located in Jacksonville and one of which is located in each of the following Illinois communities: Virden, Litchfield, and Chapin. We were originally chartered in 1916 as an Illinois-chartered mutual savings and loan association and converted to a mutual savings bank in 1992. In 1995, Jacksonville Savings Bank converted to an Illinois chartered stock savings bank and reorganized from the mutual to the mutual holding company form of organization. We have been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System since 1932. Our deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 
We are a community-oriented savings bank engaged primarily in the business of attracting retail deposits from the general public in our market area and using such funds, together with borrowings and funds from other sources, to originate mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, commercial and agricultural real estate and home equity loans. We also originate commercial and agricultural business loans and consumer loans. Additionally, we invest in United States Government agency securities, bank-qualified, general obligation municipal issues, and mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by the United States Government or enterprises thereof. We maintain a portion of our assets in liquid investments, such as overnight funds at the Federal Home Loan Bank.
 
Our principal sources of funds are customer deposits, proceeds from the sale of loans, short-term borrowings, funds received from the repayment and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, and the sale, call, or maturity of investment securities. Principal sources of income are interest income on loans and investments, sales of loans and securities, service charges, commissions, card interchange income and other fees. Our principal expenses are interest paid on deposits, employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment expense, and data processing and telecommunications expense.

We operate an investment center at our main office. The investment center is operated through Financial Resources Group, Inc., Jacksonville Savings Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
Our principal executive office is located at 1211 W. Morton, Jacksonville, Illinois, and our telephone number at that address is (217) 245-4111. Our website address is www.jacksonvillesavings.com. Information on this website is not and should not be considered to be a part of this Annual Report.         
 
Market Area
 
Our market area is Morgan, Macoupin, Montgomery and Cass counties, Illinois. Our offices are located in communities that can generally be characterized as stable to low growth residential communities of predominantly one- to four-family residences. Our market for deposits is concentrated in the communities surrounding our main office and five branch offices. We are the largest independent financial institution headquartered in Morgan County.
 
The economy of our market area consists primarily of agriculture and related businesses, light industry and state and local government. The largest employers in our market area are Reynolds, Passavant Area Hospital, and the State of Illinois. As of December 2017, unemployment rates in our market area were: 4.0% in Morgan County, 4.7% in Cass County, 4.7% in Macoupin County, and 5.4% in Montgomery County. This compared with unemployment rates of 4.7% in Illinois and 3.9% in the United States as a whole.
 
Competition
 
We encounter significant competition both in attracting deposits and in originating real estate and other loans. Our most direct competition for deposits historically has come from commercial banks, other savings banks, savings associations and credit unions in our market area, and we expect continued strong competition from such financial institutions in the foreseeable future. We compete for deposits by offering depositors a high level of personal service and expertise together with a wide range of financial services. Our deposit sources are primarily concentrated in the communities surrounding our banking offices located in Morgan, Macoupin and Montgomery counties, Illinois. As of June 30, 2017, our FDIC-insured deposit market share in the counties we serve was 11.0%, which ranked us as the second largest deposit holder out of 28 bank and thrift institutions with offices in Morgan, Macoupin, or Montgomery Counties, Illinois. Such data does not reflect deposits held by credit unions.
 
The competition for real estate and other loans comes principally from commercial banks, mortgage banking companies, government sponsored entities and other savings banks and savings associations. This competition for loans has increased substantially in recent years as a result of the large number of institutions competing in our market areas as well as the increased efforts by commercial banks to increase mortgage loan originations.
 
We compete for loans primarily through the interest rates and loan fees we charge and the efficiency and quality of services we provide to borrowers and home builders. Factors that affect competition include general and local economic conditions, current interest rate levels and the volatility of the mortgage markets.
 
Lending Activities
 
General. Historically, our principal lending activity has been the origination of mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties in our local market area. Over the past several years, we have increased our emphasis on originating loans secured by commercial and agricultural real estate. We also originate commercial and agricultural business loans secured by collateral other than real estate as well as unsecured commercial and agricultural business loans. We also originate home equity and consumer loans. At December 31, 2017, our loans receivable totaled $189.4 million, of which $45.8 million, or 24.6%, consisted of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. The remainder of our loans receivable at December 31, 2017 consisted of commercial real estate loans totaling $37.3 million, or 20.0% of net loans, agricultural real estate loans totaling $40.1 million, or 21.5% of net loans, commercial business loans totaling $26.9 million, or 14.4% of net loans, agricultural business loans totaling $13.4 million, or 7.2% of net loans, consumer loans totaling $15.8 million, or 8.4% of net loans, and home equity loans totaling $10.1 million, or 5.4% of net loans.

We have made our interest-earning assets more interest rate sensitive by, among other things, originating variable interest rate loans, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans and balloon loans with terms ranging from three to five years, as well as medium-term consumer loans and commercial business loans. Our ability to originate adjustable-rate mortgage loans is substantially affected by market interest rates.
 
We originate fixed-rate residential mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties with terms up to 30 years. We sell a significant portion of our one- to four-family fixed-rate residential mortgage loan originations with terms of generally 15 years or greater directly to the secondary market. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we sold $18.8 million and $20.7 million of fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, respectively. Loans are generally sold without recourse and with servicing retained.
 
At December 31, 2017, we were servicing $128.0 million in loans for which we received servicing income of $337,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Servicing fee income is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal and are recorded as income when earned as loan servicing fees in noninterest income. The amortization of mortgage servicing rights is netted from the gains on sale of loans, both cash gains as well as the capitalized gains, and is included in mortgage banking operations, net, in noninterest income.

One- to Four-Family Mortgage Loans. Historically our primary lending origination activity has been one- to four-family, owner-occupied, residential mortgage loans secured by property located in our market area. We generate loans through our marketing efforts, existing customers and referrals, real estate brokers, builders and local businesses. We generally limit our one- to four-family loan originations to the financing of loans secured by properties located within our market area. At December 31, 2017, $45.8 million, or 24.6% of our net loan portfolio, was invested in mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residences.
 
Our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans are generally conforming loans, underwritten according to secondary market guidelines. We generally originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which is currently $424,100 for single-family homes. At December 31, 2017, we had three one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with principal balances in excess of $424,100, commonly referred to as jumbo loans.
 
We originate for resale to the secondary market fixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with terms of 15 years or more. Our fixed-rate mortgage loans amortize monthly with principal and interest due each month. Residential real estate loans often remain outstanding for significantly shorter periods than their contractual terms because borrowers may refinance or prepay loans at their option. We offer fixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with terms of up to 30 years without prepayment penalty.
 
We currently offer adjustable-rate mortgage loans for terms ranging up to 30 years. We generally offer adjustable-rate mortgage loans that adjust between one and five years on the anniversary date of origination. Interest rate adjustments are up to two hundred basis points per year, with a cap of up to six hundred basis points on interest rate increases over the life of the loan. In a rising interest rate environment, such rate limitations may prevent adjustable-rate mortgage loans from repricing to market interest rates, which would have an adverse effect on our net interest income. In the low interest rate environment that has existed over the past few years, our adjustable-rate portfolio has repriced downward resulting in lower interest income from this portion of our loan portfolio. We have used different interest indices for adjustable-rate mortgage loans in the past such as the average yield on U.S. Treasury securities, adjusted to a constant maturity of either one-year, three-years or five-years. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate totaled $22.9 million, or 49.9% of our total one- to four-family residential real estate loans receivable at December 31, 2017. The origination of fixed-rate mortgage loans versus adjustable-rate mortgage loans is monitored on an ongoing basis and is affected significantly by the level of market interest rates, customer preference, our interest rate risk position and our competitors’ loan products. During 2017, we originated $25.1 million of fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, most of which were subsequently sold in the secondary market, and $7.8 million of adjustable-rate mortgage loans which were held in our portfolio.
 
Adjustable-rate mortgage loans make our loan portfolio more interest rate sensitive and provide an alternative for those borrowers who meet our underwriting criteria, but are unable to qualify for a fixed-rate mortgage. However, as the interest income earned on adjustable-rate mortgage loans varies with prevailing interest rates, such loans do not offer predictable cash flows in the same manner as long-term, fixed-rate loans. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans carry increased credit risk associated with potentially higher monthly payments by borrowers as general market interest rates increase. It is possible that during periods of rising interest rates that the risk of delinquencies and defaults on adjustable-rate mortgage loans may increase due to the upward adjustment of interest costs to the borrower, resulting in increased loan losses.
 
Our residential first mortgage loans customarily include due-on-sale clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the underlying real property serving as collateral for the loan. Due-on-sale clauses are a means of imposing assumption fees and increasing the interest rate on our mortgage portfolio during periods of rising interest rates.

When underwriting residential real estate loans, we review and verify each loan applicant’s income and credit history. Management believes that stability of income and past credit history are integral parts in the underwriting process. Generally, the applicant’s total monthly mortgage payment, including all escrow amounts, is limited to 30% of the applicant’s total monthly income. In addition, total monthly obligations of the applicant, including mortgage payments, should not generally exceed 43% of total monthly income. Written appraisals are generally required on real estate property offered to secure an applicant’s loan. For one- to four-family real estate loans with loan to value ratios of over 80%, we generally require private mortgage insurance. We require fire and casualty insurance on all properties securing real estate loans. We may require title insurance, or an attorney’s title opinion, as circumstances warrant.
 
We do not offer an “interest only” mortgage loan product on one- to four-family residential properties (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not offer a “subprime loan” program (loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (traditionally defined as loans having less than full documentation).
 
Commercial Real Estate Loans. We originate and purchase commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2017, $37.3 million, or 20.0%, of our net loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans. During 2017, loan originations secured by commercial real estate totaled $7.4 million as compared to $14.5 million in 2016. Our commercial real estate loans are secured primarily by improved properties such as multi-family residential properties, retail facilities and office buildings, hotels, restaurants, and other non-residential buildings. At December 31, 2017, our commercial real estate loan portfolio included $5.6 million in loans secured by multi-family residential properties, $11.9 million in loans secured by restaurants, $2.8 million in loans secured by hotels, $2.8 million secured by shopping centers, and $14.2 million in loans secured by other commercial properties. The maximum loan-to-value ratio for commercial real estate loans we originate is generally 80%. Our commercial real estate loans are generally written up to terms of five years with adjustable interest rates.  The rates are generally tied to the prime rate and generally have a specified floor. Many of our fixed-rate commercial real estate loans are not fully amortizing and therefore require a “balloon” payment at maturity. We have no interest only commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2017. We purchase from time to time commercial real estate loan participations primarily from outside our market area where we are not the lead lender. All participation loans are approved following a review to ensure that the loan satisfies our underwriting standards. At December 31, 2017, commercial real estate loan participations totaled $9.5 million, or 25.4% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio consisting primarily of loan participations outside of our market area which totaled $8.8 million, or 23.5% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio. At December 31, 2017, we had $139,000 in loan participations delinquent 60 days or more.
 
At December 31, 2017, our largest commercial real estate loan was secured by a transfer and recycling facility with a principal balance of $1.9 million and was performing in accordance with its terms. At December 31, 2017, our largest commercial real estate loan participation was secured by multiple shopping centers with a principal balance of $1.5 million and was performing in accordance with its terms.
 
Our underwriting standards for commercial real estate include a determination of the applicant’s credit history and an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The income approach is primarily utilized to determine whether income generated from the applicant’s business or real estate offered as collateral is adequate to repay the loan. We emphasize the ratio of the property’s projected net cash flow to the loan’s debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum ratio of 120%). In underwriting a loan, we consider the value of the real estate offered as collateral in relation to the proposed loan amount. Generally, the loan amount cannot be greater than 80% of the value of the real estate. We usually obtain written appraisals from either licensed or certified appraisers on all commercial real estate loans in excess of $250,000. We assess the creditworthiness of the applicant by reviewing a credit report, financial statements and tax returns of the applicant, as well as obtaining other public records regarding the applicant.
 
Loans secured by commercial real estate generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and carry larger loan balances. This increased credit risk is a result of several factors, including the effects of general economic conditions on income producing properties and the successful operation or management of the properties securing the loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related business and real estate property. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.

Agricultural Real Estate Loans. We originate and purchase agricultural real estate loans. At December 31, 2017, $40.1 million, or 21.5% of our net loan portfolio, consisted of agricultural real estate loans. During 2017, loan originations secured by agricultural real estate totaled $14.4 million, as compared to $4.2 million in 2016. The maximum loan-to-value ratio for agricultural real estate loans we originate is generally 80%. Our agricultural real estate loans are generally written up to terms of thirty years with adjustable interest rates.  The rates are generally tied to the average yield on U.S. Treasury securities, adjusted to a constant maturity of either one-year, three-years, or five-years and generally have a specified floor. Many of our fixed-rate agricultural real estate loans are not fully amortizing and therefore require a “balloon” payment at maturity. We purchase from time to time agricultural real estate loan participations primarily from other local institutions within our market area. All participation loans are approved following a review to ensure that the loan satisfies our underwriting standards. At December 31, 2017, agricultural real estate loan participations totaled $3.1 million, or 7.6% of the agricultural real estate loan portfolio. At December 31, 2017, we had no agricultural real estate loan participations delinquent 60 days or more. At December 31, 2017, our largest agricultural real estate loan was secured by farmland, had a principal balance of $4.9 million and was performing in accordance with its terms.
 
Our underwriting standards for agricultural real estate include a determination of the applicant’s credit history and an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The income approach is primarily utilized to determine whether income generated from the applicant’s farm operation or real estate offered as collateral is adequate to repay the loan. We emphasize the ratio of the property’s projected cash flow to the loan’s debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum ratio of 120%). In underwriting a loan, we consider the value of the real estate offered as collateral in relation to the proposed loan amount. Generally, the loan amount cannot be greater than 80% of the value of the real estate. We usually obtain written appraisals from either licensed or certified appraisers on all agricultural real estate loans in excess of $250,000. We assess the creditworthiness of the applicant by reviewing a credit report, financial statements and tax returns of the applicant, as well as obtaining other public records regarding the applicant.
 
Loans secured by agricultural real estate generally involve a greater degree of credit risk and carry larger loan balances than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. This increased credit risk is a result of several factors, including the effects of general economic and market conditions on farm operations and the successful operation or management of the properties securing the loans. The repayment of loans secured by agricultural estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the farm and real estate property. If the cash flow is reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.
 
Home Equity Loans. At December 31, 2017, home equity loans totaled $10.1 million, or 5.4%, of our net loan portfolio. Our home equity loans and lines of credit are generally secured by the borrower’s principal residence. The maximum amount of a home equity loan or line of credit is generally 95% of the appraised value of a borrower’s real estate collateral less the amount of any prior mortgages or related liabilities. Home equity loans and lines of credit are approved with both fixed and adjustable interest rates which we determine based upon market conditions. Such loans may be fully amortized over the life of the loan or have a balloon feature. Generally, the maximum term for home equity loans is 10 years.
 
Our underwriting standards for home equity loans include a determination of the applicant’s credit history and an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant’s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and additionally from any verifiable secondary income. We also consider the length of employment with the borrower’s present employer as well as the amount of time the borrower has lived in the local area. Creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration; however, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral in relation to the proposed loan amount. At December 31, 2017, we had no home equity loans 90 days or more delinquent. No assurance can be given, however, that our delinquency rate or loss experience on home equity loans will not increase in the future.

Home equity loans entail greater risks than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, which are secured by first lien mortgages. In such cases, collateral repossessed after a default may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of damage or depreciation in the value of the property or loss of equity to the first lien position. Further, home equity loan payments are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Finally, the application of various Federal and state laws, including Federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans in the event of a default.
 
Commercial Business Loans. We originate commercial business loans to borrowers located in our market area which are secured by collateral other than real estate or which can be unsecured. We also purchase participations of commercial business loans from other lenders, which may be made to borrowers outside our market area. Commercial business loans totaled $26.9 million, or 14.4% of our net loan portfolio at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, commercial business loan participations totaled $1.3 million, or 4.9% of the commercial business loan portfolio. All of the commercial business loan participations were outside of our market area. Commercial business loans are generally secured by equipment and inventory and generally are offered with adjustable rates tied to the prime rate or the average yield on U.S. Treasury securities, adjusted to a constant maturity of either one-year, three-years or five-years and various terms of maturity generally from three years to five years. On a limited basis, we will originate unsecured business loans in those instances where the applicant’s financial strength and creditworthiness has been established. Commercial business loans generally bear higher interest rates than residential loans, but they also may involve a higher risk of default since their repayment is generally dependent on the successful operation of the borrower’s business. We generally obtain personal guarantees from the borrower or a third party as a condition to originating business loans. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we originated $18.3 million in commercial business loans. At that date, our largest commercial business loan was a $6.0 million line of credit. This loan was performing in accordance with its terms at December 31, 2017.
 
Our underwriting standards for commercial business loans include a determination of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan from normal cash flows generated in the applicant’s business. We assess the financial strength of each applicant through the review of financial statements and tax returns provided by the applicant. The creditworthiness of an applicant is derived from a review of credit reports as well as a search of public records. We periodically review business loans following origination. We request financial statements at least annually and review them for substantial deviations or changes that might affect repayment of the loan. Our loan officers may also visit the premises of borrowers to observe the business premises, facilities, and personnel and to inspect the pledged collateral. Underwriting standards for business loans are different for each type of loan depending on the financial strength of the applicant and the value of collateral offered as security.

Agricultural Business Loans. We originate agricultural business loans to borrowers located in our market area which are secured by collateral other than real estate or which can be unsecured. Agricultural business loans totaled $13.4 million, or 7.2% of our net loan portfolio at December 31, 2017. Agricultural business loans are generally secured by equipment and blanket security agreements on all farm assets. These loans are generally offered with fixed rates with terms up to five years. Agricultural business loans generally bear lower interest rates than residential loans due to competitive market pressures. While the repayment of our agricultural business loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the farm operation, we have experienced a good history of low default rates. We generally obtain personal guarantees from the borrower as a condition to originating agricultural business loans. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we originated $14.8 million in agricultural business loans. At December 31, 2017, our largest agricultural business loan was a line of credit of $1.6 million. This loan was performing in accordance with its terms at December 31, 2017.
 
Our underwriting standards for agricultural business loans include a determination of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan from normal cash flows generated in the applicant’s business. We assess the financial strength of each applicant through the review of financial statements, pro-forma cash flow statements, and tax returns provided by the applicant. The creditworthiness of an applicant is derived from a review of credit reports as well as a search of public records. We request financial statements at least annually and review them for substantial deviations or changes that might affect repayment of the loan. Our loan officers may also visit the premises of borrowers to observe the operation, facilities, equipment, and personnel and to inspect the pledged collateral. Underwriting standards for agricultural business loans are different for each type of loan depending on the financial strength of the applicant and the value of collateral offered as security.
 
Consumer Loans. As of December 31, 2017, consumer loans totaled $15.8 million, or 8.4%, of our net loan portfolio. The principal types of consumer loans we offer are automobile loans, loans secured by deposit accounts, unsecured loans and mobile home loans. We generally offer consumer loans on a fixed-rate basis.
 
At December 31, 2017, consumer loans secured by automobiles totaled $8.2 million, or 4.3% of our net loan portfolio. We generally offer automobile loans with maturities of up to 60 months for new automobiles. Loans secured by used automobiles will have maximum terms which vary depending upon the age of the automobile. We generally originate automobile loans with a loan-to-value ratio below the greater of 80% of the purchase price or 100% of NADA loan value, although the loan-to-value ratio may be greater or less depending on the borrower’s credit history, debt to income ratio, home ownership and other banking relationships with us.
 
Our underwriting standards for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant’s credit history and an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant’s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and additionally from any verifiable secondary income. We also consider the length of employment with the borrower’s present employer as well as the amount of time the borrower has lived in the local area. Creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration; however, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral in relation to the proposed loan amount. Consumer loans 90 days or more delinquent at December 31, 2017 totaled $11,000, or 0.1% of total consumer loans. No assurance can be given, however, that our delinquency rate or loss experience on consumer loans will not increase in the future.
 
Consumer loans entail greater risks than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, particularly consumer loans secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles or loans that are unsecured. In such cases, collateral repossessed after a default may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of damage, loss or depreciation. Further, consumer loan payments are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Such events would increase our risk of loss on unsecured loans. Finally, the application of various Federal and state laws, including Federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans in the event of a default.

Loan Origination, Solicitation and Processing. Loan originations are derived from a number of sources such as real estate broker referrals, existing customers, builders, attorneys and walk-in customers. Upon receipt of a loan application, a credit report is obtained to verify specific information relating to the applicant’s employment, income, and credit standing. In the case of a real estate loan, an appraisal of the real estate intended to secure the proposed loan is undertaken by an independent appraiser approved by us. A loan application file is first reviewed by a loan officer in our loan department who checks applications for accuracy and completeness, and verifies the information provided. The financial resources of the borrower and the borrower’s credit history, as well as the collateral securing the loan, are considered an integral part of each risk evaluation prior to approval. All residential real estate loans are then verified by our loan risk management department prior to closing. The board of directors has established individual lending authorities for each loan officer by loan type. Loans over an individual officer’s lending limits must be approved by the officers’ loan committee consisting of the chairman of the board, president, chief lending officer and all lending officers, which meets three times a week, and has lending authority up to $750,000 depending on the type of loan. Loans to borrowers with an aggregate principal balance over this limit, up to $1.0 million, must be approved by the directors’ loan committee, which meets weekly and consists of the chairman of the board, president, senior vice president, chief lending officer and at least two outside directors, plus all lending officers as non-voting members. The board of directors approves all loans to borrowers with an aggregate principal balance over $1.0 million. The board of directors ratifies all loans we originate. Once the loan is approved, the applicant is informed and a closing date is scheduled. We typically fund loan commitments within 45 days.

If the loan is approved, the borrower must provide proof of fire and casualty insurance on the property serving as collateral which insurance must be maintained during the full term of the loan; flood insurance is required in certain instances. Title insurance is generally required on loans secured by real property.
 
Origination, Purchase and Sale of Loans. Set forth below is a table showing our loan originations, purchases, sales and repayments for the years indicated. It is our policy to originate for sale into the secondary market fixed-rate mortgage loans with maturities of 15 years or more and to originate for retention in our portfolio adjustable-rate mortgage loans and loans with balloon payments. Purchased loans consist of participations in commercial real estate, agricultural real estate, and commercial business loans originated by other financial institutions. We usually obtain commitments prior to selling fixed-rate mortgage loans.

Loan Origination and Other Fees. In addition to interest earned on loans, we may charge loan origination fees. Our ability to charge loan origination fees is influenced by the demand for mortgage loans and competition from other lenders in our market area. To the extent that loans are originated or acquired for our portfolio, accounting standards require that we defer loan origination fees and costs and amortize such amounts as an adjustment of yield over the life of the loan by use of the level yield method. Fees deferred are recognized into income immediately upon the sale of the related loan. At December 31, 2017, we had $214,000 of deferred loan fees. Loan origination fees are a volatile source of income. Such fees vary with the volume and type of loans and commitments made and purchased and with competitive conditions in the mortgage markets, which in turn respond to the demand and availability of money.
 
In addition to loan origination fees, we also receive other fees that consist primarily of extension fees and late charges. We recognized fees of $83,000, $93,000 and $104,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Loan Concentrations. With certain exceptions, an Illinois-chartered savings bank may not make a loan or exceed credit for secured and unsecured loans for business, commercial, corporate or agricultural purposes to a single borrower in excess of 25% of the Bank’s total capital, as defined by regulation. At December 31, 2017, our loans-to-one borrower limit was $11.0 million. At December 31, 2017 we had no lending relationships in excess of our loans-to-one borrower limitation. At December 31, 2017, we had 29 borrowers with outstanding borrowings in excess of $1.0 million totaling in the aggregate $76.4 million or 40.3% of our total loan portfolio.
Delinquencies and Classified Assets
 
Our collection procedures provide that when a mortgage loan is either ten days (in the case of adjustable-rate mortgage and balloon loans) or 15 days (in the case of fixed-rate loans) past due, a computer-generated late charge notice is sent to the borrower requesting payment and assessing a late charge. If the mortgage loan remains delinquent, a telephone call is made or a letter is sent to the borrower stressing the importance of reinstating the loan and obtaining reasons for the delinquency. We also send a 30 day notice pursuant to Illinois law if a borrower’s primary residence is the collateral at issue. When a loan continues in a delinquent status for 90 days or more, and a repayment schedule has not been made or kept by the borrower, a notice of intent to foreclose upon the underlying property is then sent to the borrower, giving 10 days to cure the delinquency. If not cured, foreclosure proceedings are initiated after the loan is 120 days past due. Consumer loans receive a ten-day grace period before a late charge is assessed. Collection efforts begin after the grace period expires. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the percentage of non-performing loans to total loans receivable were 0.93%, 0.82% and 1.03%, respectively. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the percentage of non-performing assets to total assets was 0.55%, 0.48% and 0.76%, respectively.
Nonperforming Assets and Delinquent Loans. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the opinion of management, the collection of additional interest is doubtful. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is charged against interest income. Subsequent payments are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on management’s assessment of the ultimate collectability of the loan.
 
Management monitors all past due loans and nonperforming assets. Such loans are placed under close supervision with consideration given to the need for additions to the allowance for loan losses and (if appropriate) partial or full charge-off. At December 31, 2017, we had no loans 90 days or more delinquent that were still accruing interest. Nonperforming assets increased by $243,000 to $1.8 million at December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016. The increase in the level of nonperforming assets primarily reflected increases of $222,000 in nonperforming loans and $21,000 in foreclosed assets. The increase in nonperforming loans primarily reflected the nonaccrual status of two loans totaling $392,000 secured by commercial real estate properties, both of which are listed for sale.
 
Real estate acquired through foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold. When real estate owned is acquired, it is recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance of the related loan, or its fair market value, less estimated selling expenses. Any further write-down of real estate owned is charged against earnings. At December 31, 2017, we owned $10,500 of property classified as real estate owned.

Nonperforming Assets. The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non-performing assets at the dates indicated. At December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had troubled debt restructurings (loans for which a portion of interest or principal has been forgiven and loans modified at interest rates materially less than current market rates) of $2.4 million, $2.5 million, $2.6 million, $2.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, gross interest income that would have been recorded had our nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructurings been current in accordance with their original terms was $85,000. We did not recognize any interest income on such loans for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
At December 31, 2017, we had no loans that were not currently classified as nonaccrual, 90 days past due or troubled debt restructurings where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have serious concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and that may result in disclosure as nonaccrual, 90 days past due or troubled debt restructurings.

Classified Assets. Federal and state regulations require that each insured savings institution classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with examination of insured institutions, Federal examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, classify them. There are three categories for classified assets: “substandard,” “doubtful” and “loss.” Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. For assets classified “substandard” and “doubtful,” the institution is required to establish general loan loss reserves in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Assets classified “loss” must be either completely written off or supported by a 100% specific reserve. We also maintain a category designated “special mention” which is established and maintained for assets not considered classified but having potential weaknesses or risk characteristics that could result in future problems. An institution is required to develop an in-house program to classify its assets, including investments in subsidiaries, on a regular basis and set aside appropriate loss reserves on the basis of such classification. As part of the periodic exams of Jacksonville Savings Bank by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, the staff of such agencies reviews our classifications and determine whether such classifications are adequate. Such agencies have, in the past, and may in the future require us to classify certain assets which management has not otherwise classified or require a classification more severe than established by management. At December 31, 2017, our classified loans totaled $5.9 million, all of which were classified as substandard.
 
The total amount of classified and special mention loans decreased $410,000, or 5.4%, to $7.3 million at December 31, 2017 from $7.7 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in classified and special mention loans during 2017 was due to a decrease of $1.1 million in special mention loans, partially offset by an increase of $661,000 in substandard loans. The decrease in special mention loans reflects $999,000 in loans downgraded to substandard and $386,000 in principal reductions, partially offset by $316,000 in additional loans listed as special mention during 2017. The increase in substandard loans was primarily related to the $999,000 in downgraded loans and $893,000 in additional loans classified as substandard, partially offset by $367,000 in charge-offs, $357,000 in principal reductions and $233,000 of loans transferred to real estate owned during 2017.

Allowance for Loan Losses 
 
The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that, in management’s judgment, is adequate to cover probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.
 
The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management’s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.
 
The allowance consists of allocated and general components. The allocated component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan.
 
A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial and agricultural loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
 
Groups of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated for impairment based on the group’s historical loss experience adjusted for changes in trends, conditions and other relevant factors that affect repayment of the loans. Accordingly, we do not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment measurements, unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement due to financial difficulties of the borrower.
 
The general component covers non-classified loans and is based on historical charge-off experience and expected loss given our internal risk rating process. The loan portfolio is stratified into homogeneous groups of loans that possess similar loss characteristics and an appropriate loss ratio adjusted for other qualitative factors is applied to the homogeneous pools of loans to estimate the incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The other qualitative factors considered by management include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

· | changes in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection practices;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments, including the condition of various market segments;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio;

· | changes in the experience, ability and depth of management and the lending staff;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | changes in the trend of the volume and severity of the past due, nonaccrual, and classified loans;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | changes in the quality of our loan review system and the degree of oversight by the board of directors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the existence of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in our current portfolio.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Commercial and agricultural real estate loans generally have higher credit risks compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, payment experience on loans secured by income-producing properties typically depend on the successful operation of the related real estate project and this may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the real estate market and in the general economy.
 
Commercial and agricultural business loans involve a greater risk of default than one- to four-residential mortgage loans of like duration since their repayment generally depends on the successful operation of the borrower’s business and the sufficiency of collateral if any. The repayment of agricultural loans can be greatly affected by weather conditions and commodity prices.
 
The allowance for loan losses decreased $128,000, or 4.3%, to $2.9 million at December 31, 2017 from $3.0 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in the allowance was the result of a credit in the provision for loan losses, and net recoveries. Net charge-offs decreased $84,000 to a net recovery of $52,000 during 2017 from $32,000 in net charge-offs during 2016. We recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $180,000 during 2017.
 
Nonperforming assets increased $243,000 to $1.8 million at December 31, 2017, compared to December 31, 2016. The increase in nonperforming assets was due to increases of $222,000 in non-performing loans and $21,000 in foreclosed assets held at December 31, 2017 as compared to at December 31, 2016. The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans decreased to 164.29% at December 31, 2017 as compared to 196.56% at December 31, 2016.
 
Although we maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level which we consider to be adequate to provide for potential losses, there can be no assurance that such losses will not exceed the estimated amounts or that we will not be required to make additions to the allowance for loan losses in the future. Future additions to our allowance for loan losses and changes in the related ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans are dependent upon the economy, changes in real estate values and interest rates, the view of the regulatory authorities toward adequate loan loss reserve levels, and inflation. Management will continue to review the entire loan portfolio to determine the extent, if any, to which additional loan loss provisions may be deemed necessary.

Investment Activities 
 
General. The asset/liability management committee, consisting of our Chairman of the Board, President, Senior Vice President and Investment Officer, Vice President of Operations, Chief Financial Officer, and at least two outside directors from the board, has primary responsibility for establishing our investment policy and overseeing its implementation, subject to oversight by our entire board of directors. Authority to make investments under approved guidelines is delegated to the Senior Vice President and Investment Officer. The committee meets at least quarterly. All investment transactions are reported to the board of directors for ratification quarterly.
 
The investment policy is reviewed at least annually by the full board of directors. This policy dictates that investment decisions be made based on providing liquidity, meeting pledging requirements, generating a reasonable rate of return, minimizing our tax liability through the purchase of municipal securities, minimizing exposure to credit risk and ensuring consistency with our interest rate risk management strategy. During the prolonged period of low interest rates and weak loan demand, our investment activities are a more pronounced part of our operations.
 
Our current investment policy permits us to invest in U.S. treasuries, federal agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, investment grade corporate bonds, municipal bonds, short-term instruments, and other securities. Investments in municipal bonds will be correlated with Jacksonville Savings Bank’s current level of taxable income, the need for tax-exempt income, and investment in the community. The investment policy also permits investments in certificates of deposit, securities purchased under an agreement to resell, bankers acceptances, commercial paper and federal funds.
 

20

Our current investment policy generally does not permit investment in stripped mortgage-backed securities, short sales, derivatives, or in other high-risk securities. Federal and Illinois state law generally limit our investment activities to those permissible for a national bank.
 
The accounting rules require that, at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held to maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, depending on our ability and intent. Securities available for sale are reported at fair value, while securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost. We only maintain a securities available-for-sale portfolio.
 
The portfolio consists primarily of mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds and U.S. government and agency securities all of which are classified as available for sale. Mortgage-backed securities totaled $55.2 million at December 31, 2017. General obligation municipal bonds, all of which have been issued within the State of Illinois totaled $45.3 million at December 31, 2017. Our portfolio of U.S. government and agency securities totaled $10.9 million at December 31, 2017. We expect the composition of our investment portfolio to continue to change based on liquidity needs associated with loan origination activities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we had no investment securities that were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired.
 
Under Federal regulations, we are required to maintain a minimum amount of liquid assets that may be invested in specified short-term securities and certain other investments. Liquidity levels may be increased or decreased depending upon the yields on investment alternatives and upon management’s judgment as to the attractiveness of the yields then available in relation to other opportunities and its expectation of the level of yield that will be available in the future, as well as management’s projections as to the short-term demand for funds to be used in our loan originations and other activities.
 
Mortgage-Backed Securities. We invest in mortgage-backed securities insured or guaranteed by the United States government or government sponsored enterprises. These securities, which consist of mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, had an amortized cost of $56.0 million, $45.5 million and $23.1 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The fair value of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio was $55.2 million, $44.4 million and $23.2 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the weighted average rate as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was 2.55%, 2.43% and 2.30%, respectively. At December 31, 2017, $55.2 million of the mortgage-backed securities in the investment portfolio had fixed rates of interest.
 
Mortgage-backed securities are created by pooling mortgages and issuing a security with an interest rate that is less than the interest rate on the underlying mortgages. Mortgage-backed securities typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages, although we invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as Jacksonville Savings Bank. Some securities pools are guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest to investors. Mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements. However, mortgage-backed securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans since there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our specific liabilities and obligations. Finally, mortgage-backed securities are assigned lower risk-weightings for purposes of calculating our risk-based capital level.
 
Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or acceleration of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. We periodically review current prepayment speeds to determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments.

Municipal Bonds. At December 31, 2017, we held municipal bonds with a fair value of $45.3 million. All of our municipal bonds are general obligation bonds with full taxing authority and ratings (when available) of A or above. All of our municipal bonds are issued by local municipalities or school districts located in Illinois.
 
U.S. Government and Agency Securities. At December 31, 2017, we held U.S. government and agency securities with a fair value of $10.9 million. These securities have an average expected life of 8.5 years. While these securities generally provide lower yields than other investments such as mortgage-backed securities, our current investment strategy is to maintain investments in such instruments to the extent appropriate for liquidity purposes, as collateral for borrowings, and for prepayment protection.
 
Investment Securities Portfolio. The following table sets forth the composition of our investment securities portfolio at the dates indicated. Investment securities do not include Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago stock of $491,000. All of such securities were classified as available for sale.

Sources of Funds 
 
General. Deposits and borrowings are our major sources of funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition, we derive funds from the repayment and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, operations, sales of loans into the secondary market, and the sale, call, or maturity of investment securities. Scheduled loan principal repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates and market conditions. Other sources of funds include advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. For further information see “—Borrowings.” Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources or on a longer term basis for general business purposes.
 
Deposits. We attract consumer and commercial deposits principally from within our market areas through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments including interest-bearing checking accounts, noninterest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, term certificate accounts and individual retirement accounts. We will accept deposits of $100,000 or more and may offer negotiated interest rates on such deposits. At December 31, 2017, we had deposits of $100,000 or more from public entities that totaled $30.4 million. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. We regularly evaluate our internal cost of funds, survey rates offered by competing institutions, review our cash flow requirements for lending and liquidity and execute rate changes when deemed appropriate. We do not obtain funds through brokers, nor do we solicit funds outside our market area.

Borrowings. Deposits are our primary source of funds for lending and investment activities. If the need arises, we may rely upon advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank to supplement our supply of available funds and to fund deposit withdrawals. We typically secure advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank with mortgage loans, and small business and small farm loans. The Federal Home Loan Bank functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for us and other member savings associations and financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our loans, provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made pursuant to several different programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of a member institution’s stockholders’ equity or on the Federal Home Loan Bank’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness. At December 31, 2017, we had $10.9 million in Federal Home Loan Bank advances outstanding.
 
Other borrowings consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase which are swept daily from commercial deposit accounts. We may be required to provide additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 
 
General 
 
Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As such, it is registered with, subject to examination and supervision by and otherwise required to comply with the rules and, regulations of, the Federal Reserve Board. Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc., was previously regulated as a savings and loan holding company. However, in June 2013, Jacksonville Savings Bank revoked its previous election to have Jacksonville, Bancorp, Inc. regulated as a savings and loan holding company. As a result, Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. is now regulated as a bank holding company.
 
Jacksonville Savings Bank is an Illinois-chartered savings bank subject to extensive regulation by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Jacksonville Savings Bank’s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Jacksonville Savings Bank must file reports with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation concerning its activities and financial condition, in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers or acquisitions with other depository institutions. There are periodic examinations of the Bank by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to review Jacksonville Savings Bank’s compliance with various regulatory requirements. Jacksonville Savings Bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings bank can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board or Congress could have a material impact on the operations of Jacksonville Savings Bank.
 
Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. and Jacksonville Savings Bank. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. and Jacksonville Savings Bank and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations involved.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) was enacted in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and is affecting the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with expansive powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as Jacksonville Savings Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with these laws by their applicable federal bank regulators. The legislation gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws and weakened federal preemption of state laws as to federal saving banks in certain respects.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments for deposit insurance, permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act also provided for originators of certain securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for transferred credits, directed the Federal Reserve Board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees, repealed restrictions on paying interest on checking accounts and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage origination. The Dodd-Frank Act increased shareholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments.

The Dodd-Frank Act also required the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to issue regulations requiring lenders to make a reasonable, good faith determination as to the ability of a prospective borrower to repay a residential mortgage loan. The “Ability to Repay” final rule, effective January 1, 2014, established a “qualified mortgage” safe harbor from liability for loans which have terms and features which are deemed to make the loan less risky.
 
Illinois Savings Bank Regulation
 
As an Illinois-chartered savings bank, Jacksonville Savings Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. The Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation’s regulation of Jacksonville Savings Bank covers, among other things, Jacksonville Savings Bank’s internal organization (i.e., charter, bylaws, capital requirements, transactions with directors and officers, and composition of the board of directors), as well as supervision of permissible activities and mergers and acquisitions. The lending and investment authority of Jacksonville Savings Bank is prescribed by Illinois law and regulations, as well as applicable Federal laws and regulations, and Jacksonville Savings Bank is prohibited from engaging in any activities not permitted by such laws and regulations. Jacksonville Savings Bank is required to file reports with, and is subject to periodic examinations by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. The Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation also maintains extensive enforcement power to assure compliance with law and regulations and correct unsafe practices, including cease and desist orders, civil penalties and removal of directors and officers. The Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation also may appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings bank under certain circumstances.
 
Under Illinois law, savings banks are required to maintain a minimum total capital to total assets ratio of 3%. The Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation is authorized to require a savings bank to maintain a higher minimum capital level if the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation determines that the savings bank’s financial condition or history, management or earnings prospects are not adequate. If a savings bank’s total capital ratio falls below the required level, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation may direct the savings bank to adhere to a specific written plan established by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation to correct the savings bank’s capital deficiency, as well as a number of other restrictions on the savings bank’s operations, including a prohibition on the declaration of dividends by the savings bank’s board of directors.
 
Under Illinois law, a savings bank may make both secured and unsecured loans. However, loans for business, corporate, commercial or agricultural purposes, whether secured or unsecured, may not in the aggregate exceed 15% of a savings bank’s total assets unless authorized by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. With the prior written consent of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, savings banks may also engage in real estate development activities, provided that the total investment in any one project may not exceed 15% of total capital, and the total investment in all projects may not exceed 50% of total capital. The investment authority of state chartered banks is also constrained by federal law, as is explained later. The total loans and extensions of credit outstanding at one time, both direct and indirect, by a savings bank to any borrower may not exceed 25% of the savings bank’s total capital. At December 31, 2017, Jacksonville Savings Bank did not have any loans-to-one borrower which exceeded these limitations.
 
Illinois-chartered savings banks generally have all lending, investment and other powers which are possessed by federal savings banks based in Illinois. Recent federal and state legislative developments have reduced distinctions between commercial banks and savings institutions in Illinois with respect to lending and investment authority. As federal law has expanded the authority of federally chartered savings institutions to engage in activities previously reserved for commercial banks, Illinois legislation and regulations (“parity legislation”) have given Illinois-chartered savings banks, such as Jacksonville Savings Bank, the powers of federally chartered savings institutions.

--

 

The board of directors of a savings bank may declare dividends on its capital stock based upon the savings bank’s annualized net profits except (1) dividends may not be declared if the bank fails to meet its capital requirements, (2) dividends are limited to 100% of net income in that year and (3) if total capital is less than 6% of total assets, dividends are limited to 50% of net income without prior approval of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation.
 
Branching and Interstate Banking.  The establishment of branches by Jacksonville Savings Bank is subject to approval of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and geographic limits established by state laws. The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the “Riegle-Neal Act”), as amended, facilitates the interstate expansion and consolidation of banking organizations by permitting, among other things, (i) bank holding companies that are adequately capitalized and managed to acquire banks located in states outside their home state regardless of whether such acquisitions are authorized under the law of the host state, (ii) the interstate merger of banks, and (iii) banks to establish new branches on an interstate basis.
Investment Activities. Under federal law, all state-chartered banks and savings banks, and their subsidiaries, generally limited to activities as principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized are national banks. There are certain exceptions. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is authorized to permit institutions to engage in state-authorized activities or investments not permitted for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) for institutions that meet all applicable capital requirements if it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the deposit insurance fund. Federal law and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations impose certain quantitative and qualitative restrictions on such activities and on a bank’s dealings with a subsidiary that engages in specified activities.
Transactions with Related Parties. A savings bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as Jacksonville Savings Bank. Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. is an affiliate of Jacksonville Savings Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative and collateral requirements. In addition, applicable regulations prohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. Applicable regulators require savings banks to maintain detailed records of all transactions with affiliates.
 
Jacksonville Savings Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% or greater stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders:
 

(i) | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features, and
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Jacksonville Savings Bank’s capital.
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved in advance by Jacksonville Savings Bank’s board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers of Jacksonville Savings Bank are subject to additional restrictions based on the type of loan.

Capital Maintenance. The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have adopted new regulations that implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.
 
Effective January 1, 2015 (with some changes transitioned into full effectiveness over two to four years), Jacksonville Savings Bank became subject to new capital requirements adopted by the FDIC. These new requirements created a new required ratio for common equity Tier 1 ("CETI") capital, increased the leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, changed the risk weight of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, created an additional capital conservation buffer over the required capital ratios and changed what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting these various capital requirements. Beginning in 2016, failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer will limit the ability of Jacksonville Savings Bank to pay dividends or pay discretionary bonuses. The Company is exempt from consolidated capital requirements as those requirements do not apply to certain small bank holding companies with assets under $1 billion.
 
Under the new capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (1) CETI capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets: (3) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio of 4.0%. CETI generally consists of common stock and retained earnings, subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions.
 
There are a number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital, some of which are subject to transition periods. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. Jacksonville Savings Bank does not use any of these instruments. Under the new requirements for total capital, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included in total capital. Mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of CETI will be deducted from capital. Jacksonville Savings Bank has elected to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income in its capital calculations, as permitted by the regulations. This opt-out will reduce the impact of market volatility on our regulatory capital levels.
 
The new requirements also include changes in the risk-weights of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposures. These include a 150% risk weight (increased from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in non-accrual status; a 20% (increased from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; a 250% risk weight (increased from 100%) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital; and increased risk weights (0% to 600%) for equity exposures.
 
In addition to the minimum CETI, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, Jacksonville Savings Bank will have to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CETI capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends or paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. This new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 and in 2018 is 1.875% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented in January 2019.
 
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the statute establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may order savings banks which have insufficient capital to take corrective actions. For example, a savings bank that is categorized as “undercapitalized” would be subject to growth limitations, dividend restrictions and would be required to submit a capital restoration plan for regulator approval. A holding company that controls such a savings bank must guarantee that the savings bank complies with the restoration plan subject to certain limits. A “significantly undercapitalized” savings bank would be subject to additional restrictions. Savings banks deemed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to be “critically undercapitalized” would be subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator within certain time frames.

--

 

The previously mentioned final regulatory capital rule that increases regulatory capital requirements adjusted the prompt corrective action categories accordingly effective January 1, 2015. Under the revised requirements, an institution must meet the following in order to be classified as “well capitalized”: (1) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 6.5% (new standard); (2) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% (increased from 6%); (3) a total risk-based ratio of 10% (unchanged) and (4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged).
 
At December 31, 2017, Jacksonville Savings Bank is “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules.
 
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Jacksonville Savings Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Deposit accounts in Jacksonville Savings Bank are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC, which has exercised that discretion by establishing a long range fund ratio of 2%.
 
The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions were assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s rate depended upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations. Institutions deemed less risky pay lower FDIC assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.
 
Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated the risk categories. Assessments for most institutions are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio achieving 1.5%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for most banks and savings associations to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points.
 
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Jacksonville Savings Bank. Future insurance assessment rates cannot be predicted.
 
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule order or regulatory condition imposed in writing. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.
 
In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO began to mature in 2017 and will continue to mature through 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.46 of a basis point of total assets less tangible capital.

Enforcement
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has primary federal enforcement responsibility over state savings banks. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to bring enforcement actions against such institutions and their “institution-related parties,” including officers, directors, certain shareholders, and attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution or receivership or conservatorship in certain circumstances. Potential civil money penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1.0 million per day.
Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), as implemented by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations, a savings institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in connection with its examination of a savings institution, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. Jacksonville Savings Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, Jacksonville Savings Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2017, Jacksonville Savings Bank was in compliance with this requirement.
Federal Reserve System

Holding Company Regulation
 
In June 2013, Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. changed its status from that of a savings and loan holding company to that of a bank holding company through Jacksonville Savings Bank’s revocation of a previously-made election. By so doing, the previously applicable requirement that Jacksonville Savings Bank comply with the “Qualified Thrift Lender Test,” which limited commercial lending, was eliminated.
 
Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. will be required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval would be required for the Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. In addition to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, prior approval may also be necessary from other agencies having supervisory jurisdiction over the bank to be acquired before any bank acquisition can be completed.

A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies.
 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including being “well capitalized” and “well managed,” to opt to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking. The Company has not elected to become a financial holding company.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to their subsidiary depository institutions. Instruments such as cumulative preferred stock and trust-preferred securities, which are currently includable as Tier 1 capital, by bank holding companies within certain limits are no longer includable as Tier 1 capital, subject to certain grandfathering. The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implements the Dodd-Frank Act’s directives as to holding company capital requirements.
 
In December 2014, legislation was passed by Congress that requires the Federal Reserve Board to revise its “Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement” to exempt bank and savings and loan holding companies of less than $1.0 billion of consolidated assets from the consolidated capital requirements, provided that such companies meet certain other conditions such as not engaging in significant nonbanking activities. Regulations adopting this amendment were effective May 15, 2015. Consequently, bank holding companies of under $1 billion in consolidated assets such as the Company remain exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements, unless the Federal Reserve Board determines otherwise in particular cases.
 
A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions.
 
The Federal Reserve Board’s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine.
 
The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to dividends in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends’ previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also provides for regulatory consultation prior to a holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction as of the end of a quarter in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase shares of its stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.

The status of Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act does not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws.
 
Change in Control Regulations
 
Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company such as Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the company’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquiror has the power to direct, or directly or indirectly to exercise a controlling influence over, the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, is the case with Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc., the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will be required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact.

General. Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. and Jacksonville Savings Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. or Jacksonville Savings Bank.

Bad Debt Reserves. Historically, Jacksonville Savings Bank has been subject to special provisions in the tax law regarding allowable tax bad debt deductions and related reserves. Tax law changes were enacted in 1996, pursuant to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”), that repealed the percentage of taxable income method by qualifying savings institutions to determine deductions for bad debts. This change was effective for taxable years beginning after 1995 and required the recapture of “applicable excess reserves” of a savings institution, of which Jacksonville Savings Bank is, into taxable income over a six year period. The applicable excess reserve is generally the excess of its bad debt reserves as of the close of its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 1996 over the balance of such reserves as of the close of its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 1988.
 
Currently, Jacksonville Savings Bank utilizes the experience method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 585. Under this method, the annual deduction is the amount necessary to increase the balance of the reserve at the close of the taxable year to the greater of the amount which bears the same ratio to loans outstanding at the close of the taxable year as the total net charge offs sustained during the current and preceding five taxable years bear to the sum of the loans outstanding at the close of those six years or the lower of (i) the balance in the reserve account at the close of the base year, (the last taxable year beginning before 1988), or (ii) if the amount of outstanding loans at the close of the taxable year is less than the amount of outstanding loans at the close of the base year, the amount which bears the same ratio to outstanding loans at the close of the taxable year as the balance of the reserve at the close of the base year bears to the amount of outstanding loans at the close of the base year.
 
Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if Jacksonville Savings Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests.
 
At December 31, 2017, Jacksonville Savings Bank’s total federal pre-base year reserve was approximately $2.6 million. However, under current law, base-year reserves remain subject to recapture if Jacksonville Savings Bank makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its stock, pays dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits, or ceases to maintain a bank charter.
 
Alternative Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), imposes an alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (“alternative minimum taxable income” or “AMTI”). The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMTI. Certain payments of AMT may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in December 2017, AMT will no longer be imposed, commencing in 2018.
Net Operating Loss Carryovers.  Generally, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years.   At December 31, 2017, Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. had no federal or Illinois tax loss carryforward.
Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction. Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. may exclude from its federal taxable income 100% of dividends received from Jacksonville Savings Bank as a wholly owned subsidiary. The corporate dividends received deduction is 80% when the dividend is received from a corporation having at least 20% of its stock owned by the recipient corporation. A 70% dividends-received deduction is available for dividends received from corporations owning less than 20% by the recipient corporation.
State Taxation
 
The State of Illinois imposes a tax on the Illinois taxable income of corporations, including savings banks, at the rate of 9.50% effective July 1, 2017.
 
Illinois taxable income is generally similar to federal taxable income except that interest from state and municipal obligations is taxable and no deduction is allowed for state income taxes. However, a deduction is allowed for certain U.S. Government and agency obligations. Jacksonville Savings Bank’s state income tax returns have not been audited by Illinois tax authorities during the past five years. As a Maryland business corporation, Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. is required to file annual returns and pay annual fees to the State of Maryland.
