ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
EP Energy Corporation (EP Energy), a Delaware corporation formed in 2013, is an independent exploration and production company engaged in the acquisition and development of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas properties in the United States. Our strategy is to invest in opportunities that provide the highest return across our asset base, continually seek out operating and capital efficiencies, effectively manage costs, and identify accretive acquisition opportunities and divestitures, all with the objective of enhancing our portfolio, growing asset value, improving cash flow, increasing financial flexibility and providing an attractive return to our shareholders. 
We operate through a diverse base of producing assets and are focused on the development of our drilling inventory located in three areas: the Permian basin in West Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, and the Altamont Field in the Uinta basin in Northeastern Utah. As of December 31, 2017, we had proved reserves of 392.1 MMBoe (52% oil and 72% liquids) and for the year ended December 31, 2017, we had average net daily production of 82,257 Boe/d (56% oil and 74% liquids).
Each of our areas is characterized by a long-lived reserve base and high drilling success rates. We have established significant contiguous leasehold positions in each area, representing approximately 455,000 net (608,000 gross) acres in total. 
We evaluate opportunities in our portfolio that are aligned with our strategy and our core competencies and that are in areas that we believe can provide an attractive return on our invested dollars and offer a competitive advantage. In addition to opportunities in our current portfolio, strategic acquisitions of leasehold acreage or acquisitions of producing assets can allow us to leverage existing expertise in our operating areas, balance our exposure to regions, basins and commodities, help us achieve or enhance risk-adjusted returns competitive with those available in our existing programs and increase our reserves. We also continuously evaluate our asset portfolio and will sell oil and natural gas properties if they no longer meet our long-term objectives.
The following table provides a summary of oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves as of December 31, 2017 and production data for the year ended December 31, 2017 for each of our areas of operation.

(1) | Proved reserves were evaluated based on the average first day of the month spot price for the preceding 12-month period of $51.34 per Bbl (WTI) and $2.98 per MMBtu (Henry Hub).

(2)    Includes 13 MMBoe of proved developed non-producing reserves representing 3% of total net proved reserves at December 31, 2017.
Approximately 205 MMBoe, or 52%, of our total proved reserves are proved developed producing assets, which generated average production of 82.3 MBoe/d in 2017 from approximately 1,608 wells. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 204 MMBbls of proved oil reserves, 80 MMBbls of proved NGLs reserves and 652 Bcf of proved natural gas reserves, representing 52%, 20% and 28%, respectively, of our total proved reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 74% of our production was related to oil and NGLs versus 70% in 2016.  
As of December 31, 2017, we operated 92% of our producing wells. This control provides us with flexibility around the amount and timing of capital spending and has allowed us to improve our capital and operating efficiencies. We also employ a function-based organizational structure to accelerate knowledge sharing, innovation, evaluation and target efficiencies across our drilling, completion and operating activities across our operating areas. In 2017, we completed 149 wells with a success rate of 100%, adding approximately 24 MMBoe of proved reserves (70% of which were liquids). As of December 31, 2017, we also had a total of 47 wells drilled, but not completed across our programs.

Our Properties
Eagle Ford Shale.  The Eagle Ford Shale, located in South Texas, is one of the premier unconventional oil plays in the United States. We were an early entrant into this play in late 2008, and since that time have acquired a leasehold position in the core of the oil window, primarily in La Salle County. The Eagle Ford formation in La Salle County has up to 125 feet of net thickness (165 feet gross). Due to its high carbonate content, the formation is also very brittle, and exhibits high productivity when fractured.  As of December 31, 2017, we had 92,997 net (104,108 gross) acres in the Eagle Ford.
During 2017, we invested $227 million in capital in our Eagle Ford Shale and operated an average of approximately one drilling rig.  As of December 31, 2017, we had 635 net producing wells (628 net operated wells) and are currently running two rigs in this program. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our average net daily production was 35,667 Boe/d, representing a decrease of 18% over the same period in 2016 due to natural declines and the slower pace of development from reduced capital spending since 2016.  
In December 2017, we entered into an agreement to acquire certain producing properties and undeveloped acreage primarily in La Salle County. This acquisition represents a 26 percent expansion of our current Eagle Ford acreage position or approximately 24,500 net acres for approximately $245 million subject to customary closing adjustments.  We closed the acquisition on January 31, 2018. 
Permian.  The Permian basin is characterized by numerous, stacked oil reservoirs that provide excellent targets for horizontal drilling. In 2009 and 2010, we leased 138,130 net (138,469 gross) acres on the University of Texas Land System in the Permian basin, located primarily in Reagan, Crockett, Upton and Irion counties. 
Our large, contiguous acreage positions are characterized by stacked pay zones, including the Wolfcamp A, B, and C zones, which combine for over 750 feet of net (approximately 1,000 feet of gross) thickness. The Permian has high organic content and is composed of interbedded shale, silt, and fine-grained carbonate that respond favorably to fracture stimulation.  As of December 31, 2017, we had 182,102 net (184,826 gross) acres in the Permian.
The acreage is also prospective for the Cline Shale, which has approximately 100 feet of net (approximately 200 feet of gross) thickness, and potential vertical drilling locations in the Spraberry and other stacked formations.
During 2017, we invested $267 million in capital (including approximately $29 million in acquisition capital) in the Permian and operated an average of approximately two drilling rigs. As of December 31, 2017, we had 335 net producing wells (332 net operated wells). We are currently running one rig in this program.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, our average net daily production was 28,711 Boe/d, representing an increase of 34% over 2016 reflecting incremental capital allocated to this program in 2016 and 2017.  
In January 2017, we entered into a drilling joint venture to accelerate and fund future oil and natural gas development in the Permian basin.  Under the joint venture, our partner may participate in the development of up to 150 wells in two separate 75 well tranches primarily in Reagan and Crockett counties.  We retain operational control of the joint venture assets. The first wells under the joint venture began producing in January 2017 and as of December 31, 2017, we have drilled and completed 58 wells. For a further discussion of this joint venture, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Our Business” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, Note 11.
In 2016, we amended our Consolidated Drilling and Development Unit Agreement with the University of Texas Land System in the Permian basin to provide flexibility to extend the time frame to hold our acreage by nearly four years to the end of 2021, with an increase in annual well completion requirements from six wells per year to 34, 55 and 55 wells per year in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. We fulfilled this requirement in 2016 and 2017. The amendment has a variable royalty that improves well returns in a lower price environment. The rates associated with the variable royalty are determined using a rolling average six month price with royalty rates of 12.5% at an average price of $50 per Bbl (WTI) and below, 18.75% at an average price of $50.01 to $60 per Bbl (WTI), 25% at an average price of $60.01 to $80 per Bbl (WTI) and 28% above $80 per Bbl (WTI).
Altamont.  The Altamont Field is located in the Uinta basin in northeastern Utah. The Uinta basin is characterized by naturally fractured, tight-oil sands and carbonates with multiple pay zones. Our operations are primarily focused on developing the Altamont Field Complex (comprised of the Altamont, Bluebell and Cedar Rim fields), which is the largest field in the basin. We own 179,978 net (318,877 gross) acres in Duchesne and Uinta Counties. The Altamont Field Complex has a gross pay interval thickness of over 4,300 feet and we believe the Wasatch and Green River formations are ideal targets for low-risk, infill, vertical drilling and modern fracture stimulation techniques. Our commingled production is from over 1,500 feet of net stimulated rock. Our current activity is mainly focused on the development of our vertical inventory on 80-acre and 160-acre

spacing and we continue to evaluate horizontal opportunities. Industry activity has focused on horizontal drilling in the Wasatch and Green River formations testing tight carbonate and sand intervals and has also piloted 80-acre vertical downspacing in these formations. Due to the largely held-by-production nature of our acreage position, if horizontal drilling is successful, it will result in additional opportunities that could be added to our inventory of drilling locations.
During 2017, we invested $93 million in capital in Altamont and operated an average of approximately two drilling rigs. As of December 31, 2017, we had 385 net producing wells (377 net operated wells) and are currently running two rigs in this program.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, our average net daily production was 17,795 Boe/d, representing an increase of 8% over 2016.  
In May 2017, we entered into a drilling joint venture to accelerate and fund future oil and natural gas development in Altamont.  Under the joint venture, our partner is participating in the development of 60 wells and will provide a capital carry in exchange for a 50 percent working interest in the joint venture wells. The first wells under the joint venture began producing in July 2017 and as of December 31, 2017, we have drilled and completed 16 wells.
In December 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell acreage in the Altamont area for approximately $180 million of cash proceeds subject to customary closing adjustments. This divestiture includes 4.5 MMBoe of proved developed reserves and approximately 13 percent of our current Altamont acreage position or approximately 23,330 net acres.  We closed this transaction in February 2018. 
The following table provides a summary of acreage and gross operated wells completed in our areas as of December 31, 2017:

 | Acres | Gross Operated Wells Completed(#)
 | Gross | Net | 
Eagle Ford Shale | 104,108 | | 92,997 | 53 
Permian | 184,826 | | 182,102 | 71

Oil and Natural Gas Properties
Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Reserves and Production
Proved Reserves
The table below presents information about our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, based on our internal reserve report. The reserve data represents only estimates which are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. The risks and uncertainties associated with estimating proved oil and natural gas reserves are discussed further in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at December 31, 2017.

(1) | Proved reserves were evaluated based on the average first day of the month spot price for the preceding 12-month period of $51.34 per Bbl (WTI) and $2.98 per MMBtu (Henry Hub). For a further discussion of our proved reserves and changes therein see Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", under the heading Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Operations.


(2) | Includes 205 MMBoe of proved developed producing reserves representing 52% of total net proved reserves and 13 MMBoe of proved developed non-producing reserves representing 3% of total net proved reserves at December 31, 2017.

Our reserves in the table above are consistent with estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies except for differences of less than 5% resulting from actual production, acquisitions, property sales, necessary reserve revisions and additions to reflect actual experience.  Our estimated net proved reserves were prepared by our internal reserve engineers and audited by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), our independent petroleum engineering consultants.
The table below presents net proved reserves as reported and sensitivities related to our estimated proved reserves based on differing price scenarios as of December 31, 2017.

 | Net Proved Reserves(MMBoe)
As Reported | 392.1 
10 percent increase in commodity prices | 393.9 
10 percent decrease in commodity prices | 389.5 

The sensitivities in the table above were based on the average first day of the month spot price for the preceding 12-month period of $51.34 per barrel of oil (WTI) and $2.98 per MMBtu of natural gas (Henry Hub) used to determine net proved reserves at December 31, 2017.
We employ a technical staff of engineers and geoscientists that perform technical analysis of each undeveloped location. The staff uses industry accepted practices to estimate, with reasonable certainty, the economically producible oil and natural gas. The practices for estimating hydrocarbons in place include, but are not limited to, mapping, seismic interpretation of two-dimensional and/or three-dimensional data, core analysis, mechanical properties of formations, thermal maturity, well logs of existing penetrations, correlation of known penetrations, decline curve analysis of producing locations with significant production history, well testing, static bottom hole testing, flowing bottom hole pressure analysis and pressure and rate transient analysis.

Our primary internal technical person in charge of overseeing our reserves estimates has a B.S. degree in Petroleum Engineering and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. He is the director of the reservoir engineering evaluations and strategic planning groups of the company.  In this capacity, he oversees the reserve reporting and technical support groups. He has more than 24 years of industry experience in various domestic and international engineering and management roles. For a discussion of the internal controls over our proved reserves estimation process, see Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates”.
Ryder Scott conducted an audit of the estimates of net proved reserves that we prepared as of December 31, 2017.  In connection with its audit, Ryder Scott reviewed 100% (by volume) of our total net proved reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis, representing 99% of the total discounted future net cash flows of these net proved reserves.  Ryder Scott did not audit our non-operated properties, which are less than 1% of our net proved reserves by volume. For the audited properties, 100% of our total net proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves were evaluated.  Ryder Scott concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies that we utilized in preparing our estimates of net proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 complied with current SEC regulations and the overall net proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by us are, in aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines of 10% as set forth in the Society of Petroleum Engineers auditing standards.  Ryder Scott’s report is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the reserves audit by Ryder Scott has a B.S. degree in chemical engineering. He is a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas, a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and has more than 14 years of experience in petroleum reserves evaluation.
In general, the volume of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire additional properties with proved reserves, or both, our proved reserves will decline as they are produced. Recovery of PUD reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully, but future events, including commodity price changes, may cause these assumptions to change. In addition, estimates of PUD reserves and proved non-producing reserves are inherently subject to greater uncertainties than estimates of proved producing reserves. For further discussion of our reserves, see Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", under the heading Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Operations.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves (PUDs)
As of December 31, 2017, we have 174 MMBoe of PUD reserves in our areas, all of which are scheduled to be developed within five years of their initial recording. Estimated capital expenditures to develop our PUD reserves (convert PUD reserves to proved developed reserves) are based upon a long-range plan approved by the Board of Directors. All PUD locations are surrounded by producing properties, and a majority of our PUDs directly offset a producing property. Where we have recorded PUDs beyond one location away from a producing property, reasonable certainty of economic producibility has been established by reliable technology in our areas, including field tests that demonstrate consistent and repeatable results within the formation being evaluated.
5

We assess our PUD reserves on a quarterly basis. The following table summarizes our changes in PUDs for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, respectively (in MMBoe): 

Balance, December 31, 2015 | 289.4 | 
Extensions and discoveries | 54.9 | 
Revisions due to prices | (4.4 | )
Revisions other than prices | (87.4 | )
Transfers to proved developed | (24.7 | )
Balance, December 31, 2016 | 227.8 | 
Extensions and discoveries | 15.1 | 
Revisions due to prices | 1.4 | 
Revisions other than prices | (23.4 | )
Transfers to proved developed | (30.7 | )
Divestitures | (16.4 | )
Balance, December 31, 2017 | 173.8 | 


 Extensions and discoveries in 2016 and 2017 are primarily related to drilling activities in the Eagle Ford, Permian and Altamont areas. Revisions due to prices represent PUD revisions due to increases or decreases in commodity prices (using SEC 12-month average pricing). For the year ended December 31, 2017, revisions other than prices include, among other items, negative revisions of 23 MMBoe due to a reallocation of capital in our development areas; a negative PUD ownership reversion of 10 MMBoe as a result of our variable royalty agreement in the Permian; and a positive revision of 10 MMBoe from improved operating expenses and planned development of longer lateral PUDs. The year ended December 31, 2017 includes 63 MMBoe of our PUDs that have a positive undiscounted value, but a negative value when discounted at 10 percent. The majority of these PUDs become negative at a 10 percent discount rate due to an ownership reversion associated with a long-term drilling commitment. The divestiture of 16 MMBoe is related to drilling joint ventures we entered into during 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, revisions other than prices include, among other items, negative revisions of 98 MMBoe due to reductions in our estimated capital in our five year development plan, partially offset by positive PUD revisions of 17 MMBoe due to ownership revisions. 
During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we spent approximately $377 million, $281 million and $835 million, respectively, to convert approximately 13% or 31 MMBoe, 9% or 25 MMBoe and 14% or 55 MMBoe, respectively, of our prior year-end PUD reserves to proved developed reserves.  The lower conversion rates in 2016 and 2015 are a result of reductions in actual capital spending compared to what was planned in response to the downturn in prices that occurred and has continued since the fourth quarter of 2014. In 2018, 2019 and 2020 we estimate we will spend approximately $429 million, $455 million and $554 million to develop our PUD reserves, respectively, based on our December 31, 2017 internal reserve report. At this level of spending from 2018 through 2020, we will develop approximately 64% of our existing PUD reserves with the remaining balance of PUDs to be developed in the succeeding two years. We believe we have the ability, and we have the intent to develop our PUDs over five years based on our strategic plan. The actual amount and timing of our forecasted expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including actual drilling results, service costs and future commodity prices which in the future could be lower than those in our projected long-range plan.

(1)    Gross interest reflects the total acreage we participate in regardless of our ownership interest in the acreage.
(2)    Net interest is the aggregate of the fractional working interests that we have in the gross acreage.
Our net developed acreage is concentrated in Texas (50%) and Utah (48%). Our net undeveloped acreage is concentrated in Texas (50%), Utah (27%), Wyoming (11%) and West Virginia (10%). Approximately 6%, 3% and 2% of our net undeveloped acreage is held under leases that have minimum remaining primary terms expiring in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. We employ various techniques to manage the expiration of leases, including drilling the acreage ourselves prior to lease expiration, entering into farm-out or joint development agreements with other operators or extending lease terms.

Acquisition, Development and Exploration Expenditures
See Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" under the heading Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Operations in the Total Costs Incurred table for details on our acquisition, development and exploration expenditures.
Transportation, Markets and Customers
Our marketing strategy seeks to ensure maximum deliverability of our physical production at the maximum realized prices. We leverage knowledge of markets and transportation infrastructure to enter into beneficial downstream processing, treating and marketing contracts. We primarily sell our domestic oil and natural gas production to third parties at spot market prices, while we sell our NGLs at market prices under monthly or long-term contracts. We typically sell our oil production to a relatively small number of creditworthy counterparties, as is customary in the industry. For the year ended December 31, 2017, eleven purchasers accounted for approximately 89% of our oil revenues. The top two purchasers are: Flint Hills Resources, LP (an affiliate of Koch Industries) and Shell Trading U.S. Co. (an affiliate of Shell Oil Company), which together accounted for approximately 39% of our oil revenues. Across all of our areas, we maintain adequate gathering, treating, processing and transportation capacity, as well as downstream sales arrangements, to accommodate our production volumes.
In our Eagle Ford Shale area, we are connected to the Camino Real oil gathering system and to the NuStar Energy system.  The vast majority of our oil production flows on Camino Real, a 68-mile long pipeline with over 110,000 Bbls/d of capacity and a gravity bank that allows for oil blending to maintain attractive API levels. We have 80,000 Bbls/d of firm capacity on this oil system, of which we utilized an average of 32% during December 2017 and 33% on average for the year.  The system delivers oil to the Storey Oil Terminal east of Cotulla, Texas, southeast of Gardendale, Texas.  From the Storey Oil Terminal, oil can be pumped into Harvest’s Arrowhead #1 and/or #2 pipelines, as well as the Plains All American Pipeline connection to the Gardendale Hub.  Oil can also be loaded into trucks out of the Storey Oil Terminal or out of the numerous central tank batteries throughout our field, providing additional deliverability, reliability and flexibility.  We currently market our oil either at the Storey Oil Terminal, Gardendale or at our central tank batteries under a combination of short and long-term contracts, ranging from monthly deals to multi-year term sales. With adequate takeaway capacity in the region and close proximity to the Gulf Coast refining complex, we believe we have sufficient capacity on our contracts and do not anticipate any issues with marketing and delivering volumes from the Eagle Ford Shale. 
Our Eagle Ford natural gas production flows on either the Camino Real gas gathering system or the Frio LaSalle Pipeline system with the majority flowing on the Camino Real gas gathering system. The Camino Real gas gathering system receives high-pressure, unprocessed wellhead gas into an 83-mile pipeline with capacity up to 150 MMcf/d.  The gas is then redelivered into interconnects with ETC Texas Pipeline LTD, Enterprise Hydrocarbons LP, Regency Energy Partners LP and Eagle Ford Gathering LLC.  We currently have 125 MMcf/d of firm transportation capacity on Camino Real, of which we used an average of 42% during December 2017, and we have additional capacity available as needed.  We have firm gas gathering, processing and transportation agreements on three of the interconnected gas pipelines downstream of the Camino Real system, with a minimum capacity of approximately 100 MMBtu/d and rights to increase firm capacity as necessary.  In addition, gas produced from our northwest acreage position within the Eagle Ford area is connected to the Frio LaSalle Pipeline system, which provides access to firm H2S treating and processing.  Frio LaSalle can either return gas to the Camino Real system or, after processing, deliver to various Texas intrastate pipelines and a mix of interstates, such as Texas Eastern Transmission, Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and Transco. We market our physical gas to various purchasers at spot market prices. 
In the Permian basin, we continue to leverage significant legacy gathering, processing and transportation infrastructure. For natural gas, we are connected to the West Texas Gas (WTG), DCP Midstream LP, Targa Pipeline Mid-Continent WestTex LLC and Lucid Energy WesTex LLC gathering systems, and we process a majority of our gas at the WTG Benedum & Sonora gas plants. We receive Waha pricing for our natural gas and Mt. Belvieu pricing for our NGLs. “Waha pricing” refers to the published index price for spot and monthly physical natural gas purchases and sales made into interstate and intrastate pipelines at the outlet of the Waha header system and in the Waha vicinity in the Permian basin in West Texas. “Mt. Belvieu pricing” refers to the spot market price for NGLs delivered into the Mt. Belvieu NGL processing and storage hub in Mt. Belvieu, Texas. Our crude oil production facilities are connected to a third party oil gathering system that delivers to a Plains All American Pipeline at Owens Station in Reagan County, Texas, the Centurion Cline Shale Pipeline at Barnhart in Irion County, Texas and to the Magellan Longhorn pipeline in Crockett County, Texas. We sell our pipeline delivered crude to multiple purchasers under both short and long-term contracts at WTI-based pricing. We also maintain the capability to truck crude oil to those same purchasers under similarly-priced contracts to provide additional flow assurance. Given current Permian basin takeaway capacity, we anticipate no limitations moving physical crude oil to market and expect regional pricing to remain correlated with NYMEX/WTI.
In our Altamont area, the wax crude we produce is sold at the wellhead to multiple purchasers who transport the oil via truck to downstream refineries. We sell most of the oil we produce in the basin to Salt Lake City refineries under long-term 
9

sales agreements that accommodate our production forecasts. Our produced natural gas is gathered and processed at the Altamont plant, a third-party-owned processing facility, under a long-term sales agreement that provides for residue gas return for operational use. 
While most of our physical production is priced off spot market indices, we actively manage the volatility of spot market pricing through our risk management program. We enter into financial derivatives contracts on our oil, natural gas and a portion of our NGLs production to stabilize our cash flows, reduce the risk of downward commodity price movements and protect the economic assumptions associated with our capital investment program. We employ a disciplined risk management program that utilizes risk control processes. For a further discussion of these risk management activities and derivative contracts, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
Competitors
The exploration and production business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of additional oil and natural gas reserves and in the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Our competitors include major and intermediate sized oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas operators and individual producers or operators with varying scopes of operations and financial resources. Competitive factors include financial resources, price and contract terms, our ability to access drilling, completion and other equipment and our ability to hire and retain skilled personnel on a timely and cost effective basis. Ultimately, our future success in this business will be dependent on our ability to find and/or fund the acquisition and development of additional reserves at costs that yield acceptable returns on the capital invested.
Use of 3-D Seismic Data
Within our areas we have an inventory of approximately 1,463 square miles of 3-D seismic data providing approximately 49% coverage of our leased acreage in those areas. We use our 3-D seismic data to improve our geologic models for each area. In the Eagle Ford and the Permian, detailed maps of structural features (e.g., natural fractures, faulting and stratigraphic discontinuities) are used to position well bore laterals to optimally exploit oil bearing zones and navigate drilling hazards. In Altamont, data analytics are run using 3-D seismic attributes to identify ideal locations in the reservoir and estimate resource distribution. Seismic data sets are continually updated to keep pace with technological advancements in seismic processing. 
Regulatory Environment
Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are regulated at the federal, state and local levels in the United States. These regulations include, but are not limited to, those governing the drilling and spacing of wells, conservation, forced pooling and protection of correlative rights among interest owners.  We are also subject to various governmental safety and environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
Our operations under federal oil and natural gas leases are regulated by the statutes and regulations of the Department of the Interior (DOI) that currently impose liability upon lessees for the cost of environmental impacts resulting from their operations. Royalty obligations on all federal leases are regulated by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue within the DOI, which has promulgated valuation guidelines for the payment of royalties by producers. These laws and regulations affect the construction and operation of facilities, water disposal rights and drilling operations, among other items.  In addition, we maintain insurance to limit exposure to sudden and accidental pollution liability exposures.
Hydraulic Fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a process of pumping fluid and proppant (usually sand) under high pressure into deep underground geologic formations that contain recoverable hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbon formations are typically thousands of feet below the surface. The hydraulic fracturing process creates small fractures in the hydrocarbon formation. These fractures allow natural gas and oil to move more freely through the formation to the well and finally to the surface production facilities. We use hydraulic fracturing to maximize productivity of our oil and natural gas wells in our areas, and our proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves will be developed using hydraulic fracturing. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred costs of approximately $222 million associated with hydraulic fracturing.
Hydraulic fracturing fluid is typically composed of over 99% water and proppant, which is usually sand. The other 1% or less of the fluid is composed of additives that may contain acid, friction reducer, surfactant, gelling agent and scale inhibitor. We retain service companies to conduct such operations and we have worked with several service companies to evaluate, test and, where appropriate, modify our fluid design to reduce the use of chemicals in our fracturing fluid. We have worked closely with our service companies to provide voluntary and regulatory disclosure of our hydraulic fracturing fluids.
In order to protect surface and groundwater quality during the drilling and completion phases of our operations, we follow applicable industry practices and legal requirements of the applicable state oil and natural gas commissions with regard 
10

to well design, including requirements associated with casing steel strength, cement strength and slurry design. Our activities in the field are monitored by state and federal regulators. Key aspects of our field protection measures include: (i) pressure testing well construction and integrity, (ii) casing and cementing practices to ensure pressure management and separation of hydrocarbons from groundwater, and (iii) public disclosure of the contents of hydraulic fracturing fluids.
In addition to these measures, our drilling, casing and cementing procedures are designed to prevent fluid migration and typically include some or all of the following:

• | Our drilling process executes several repeated cycles conducted in sequence—drill, set casing, cement casing and then test casing and cement for integrity before proceeding to the next drilling interval.


• | Conductor casing is drilled and cemented or driven in place. This string serves as the structural foundation for the well. Conductor casing is not necessary or required for all wells.


• | Surface casing is set and is cemented in place. Surface casing is set on all wells. The purpose of the surface casing is to isolate and protect Underground Sources of Drinking Water (USDW) as identified by federal and state regulatory bodies. The surface casing and cement isolates wellbore materials from any potential contact with USDWs.


• | Intermediate casing is set through the surface casing to a depth necessary to isolate abnormally pressured subsurface formations from normally pressured formations. Intermediate casing is not necessary or required for all wells. Our standard practices include cementing above any hydrocarbon bearing zone and performing casing pressure tests to verify the integrity of the casing and cement.


• | Production casing is set through the surface and intermediate casing through the depth of the targeted producing formation. Our standard practices include pumping cement above the confining structure of the target zone and performing casing pressure tests and other tests to verify the integrity of the casing and cement. If any problems are detected, then appropriate remedial action is taken.


• | With the casing set and cemented, a barrier of steel and cement is in place that is designed to isolate the wellbore from surrounding geologic formations. This barrier as designed mitigates against the risk of drilling or fracturing fluids entering potential sources of drinking water.

In addition to the required use of casing and cement in the well construction, we follow additional regulatory requirements and industry operating practices. These typically include pressure testing of casing and surface equipment and continuous monitoring of surface pressure, pumping rates, volumes of fluids and chemical concentrations during hydraulic fracturing operations. When any pressure differential outside the normal range of operations occurs, pumping is shut down until the cause of the pressure differential is identified and any required remedial measures are completed. Hydraulic fracturing fluid is delivered to our sites in accordance with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations in DOT approved shipping containers using DOT transporters.
We also have procedures to address water use and disposal. This includes evaluating surface and groundwater sources, commercial sources, and potential recycling and reuse of treated water sources. When commercially and technically feasible, we use recycled or treated water. This practice helps mitigate against potential adverse impacts to other water supply sources. When using raw surface or groundwater, we obtain all required water rights or compensate owners for water consumption. We are evaluating additional treatment capability to augment future water supplies at several of our sites. During our drilling and completions operations, we manage waste water to minimize environmental risks and costs. Flowback water returned to the surface is typically contained in steel tanks or pits. Water that is not treated for reuse is typically piped or trucked to waste disposal injection wells, a number of which we operate. These wells are permitted through the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). We also use commercial UIC permitted water injection facilities for flowback and produced water disposal.
We have not received regulatory citations or notice of suits related to our hydraulic fracturing operations for environmental concerns. We have not experienced a surface release of fluids associated with hydraulic fracturing that resulted in material financial exposure or significant environmental impact. Consistent with local, state and federal requirements, releases are reported to appropriate regulatory agencies and site restoration completed. No remediation reserve has been identified or anticipated as a result of hydraulic fracturing releases experienced to date.
Spill Prevention/Response Procedures. There are various state and federal regulations that are designed to prevent and respond to any spills or leaks resulting from exploration and production activities. In this regard, we maintain spill prevention control and countermeasures programs, which frequently include the installation and maintenance of spill containment devices 
11

designed to contain spill materials on location. In addition, we maintain emergency response plans to minimize potential environmental impacts in the event of a spill or leak or any significant hydraulic fracturing well control issue.
