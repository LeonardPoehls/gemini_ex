Item 1. Business 
References to “we,” “us” or “our” refer to NorthStar Realty Europe Corp. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise. References to “our Manager” refer to NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. for the period prior to the Mergers (refer below) and Colony NorthStar, Inc., for the period subsequent to the Mergers. As part of the Merger, NSAM changed its name to Colony NorthStar, Inc.
Overview
NorthStar Realty Europe Corp., a publicly-traded real estate investment trust, or REIT, is a European focused commercial real estate company with predominantly prime office properties in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France. Our objective is to provide our stockholders with stable and recurring cash flow supplemented by capital growth over time. We commenced operations on November 1, 2015 following the spin-off by NorthStar Realty Finance Corp., or NorthStar Realty, of its European real estate business (excluding its European healthcare properties) into a separate publicly-traded company, NorthStar Realty Europe Corp., a Maryland corporation, or the Spin-off.
Upon completion of the Spin-off, NorthStar contributed: (i) its business activities related to the launch of the European real estate business and the acquisition of a multi-tenant office complex located in the United Kingdom, or the U.K. Complex, acquired on September 16, 2014, or the Acquisition Date, referred to as the NorthStar Europe Predecessor; (ii) other European real estate portfolios acquired in the second and third quarters of 2015 primarily comprised of multi-tenant office properties, or the New European Investments; and (iii) certain other assets and liabilities related to NorthStar Realty’s European real estate business, herein collectively referred to as the European Real Estate Business. 
On November 2, 2015, our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, under the symbol “NRE.” We are externally managed and advised by an affiliate of our Manager. Substantially all of our assets, directly or indirectly, are held by, and we conduct our operations, directly or indirectly, through NorthStar Realty Europe Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership and our operating partnership, or our Operating Partnership. We have elected to be taxed and will continue to conduct our operations so as to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
Significant Developments 
Sales Initiatives
In 2016, we announced a strategy to focus on prime office properties located in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France, or our Core Market. As a result, we undertook a sales initiative, selling 22 properties as of March 1, 2017 and realizing $380 million of net proceeds. Consequently, we no longer operate in Belgium, Italy or Sweden. In 2017, we expect to continue executing on our sales initiatives primarily with the goal of maximizing long-term stockholder value. 
Senior Notes
In July 2015, we issued $340 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior stock-settlable notes due December 2016, or the Senior Notes. In 2016, we repurchased approximately $272.3 million of the Senior Notes and settled the remaining amount in cash at maturity.
Mergers Agreement among NSAM, NorthStar Realty and Colony Capital, Inc.
On January 10, 2017, our external manager, NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc., or NSAM, completed a tri-party merger with NorthStar Realty and Colony Capital, Inc., or Colony, under which the companies combined in an all-stock merger, or the Mergers, of equals transaction to create a diversified real estate and investment management company. Under the terms of the merger agreement, NSAM, Colony and NorthStar Realty, through a series of transactions, merged with and into NSAM, which was renamed Colony NorthStar Inc., or Colony NorthStar or CLNS, (NYSE: CLNS). Colony NorthStar is a leading global equity REIT with an embedded investment management platform.

Investing Strategy
We seek to provide our stockholders with a stable and recurring cash flow for distribution supplemented by capital growth over time. Our business is predominantly focused on prime office properties located in key cities within our Core Markets. Our Core Markets are not only the largest economies in Europe, but are the most established, liquid and among the most stable office markets in Europe. We seek to utilize our established local networks to source suitable investment opportunities. We have a long term investment approach and expect to make equity investments, directly or indirectly through joint ventures.
Financing Strategy
We seek to access a wide range of secured and unsecured debt and public and private equity capital sources to fund our investment activities. We predominantly use investment-level financing as part of our strategy to seek to prudently leverage our investments and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders. We target overall leverage of 40% to 50% over time, although there is no assurance that this will be the case.
We pursue a variety of financing arrangements such as mortgage notes and bank loans available from the commercial mortgage-backed securities market, finance companies and banks. In addition, we may use corporate-level financing such as credit facilities and other term borrowings. We generally seek to limit our reliance on recourse borrowings. Borrowing levels for our investments may be dependent upon the nature of the investments and the related financing that is available.
Attractive long-term, non-recourse, non-mark-to-market, financing continues to be available in the European markets. We predominately use floating rate financing and we seek to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising through hedging arrangements including interest rate swaps and caps.
In May 2016, we entered into a $75 million revolving credit facility with certain commercial bank lenders with an initial one year term. In October 2016, we reduced the aggregate commitment under the revolving credit facility to $35 million. 
Refer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” for discussion of liquidity requirements and sources of capital resources.

Risk Management 
Risk management is a significant component of our strategy to deliver consistent risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders. Given our need to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we closely monitor our portfolio and actively seek to manage risks associated with, among other things, our assets, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. In addition, the audit committee of our board of directors, in consultation with management, will periodically review our policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including key risks to which we are subject, such as credit risk, liquidity risk, financing risk, foreign currency risk and market risk, and the steps that management has taken to monitor and control such risks. The audit committee of our board of directors maintains oversight of financial reporting risk matters.
Underwriting
Prior to making any equity investments, our underwriting team, in conjunction with third-party providers, undertakes a rigorous asset-level due diligence process, involving intensive data collection and analysis, to seek to ensure that we understand fully the state of the market and the risk-reward profile of the asset. In addition, we evaluate material accounting, legal, financial and business issues surrounding such investment. These issues and risks are built into the valuation of an asset and ultimate pricing of an investment. 
During the underwriting process, we review the following data, including, but not limited to: property financial data including historic and budgeted financial statements, liquidity and capital expenditure plans, property operating metrics (including occupancy, leasing activity, lease expirations, sales information, tenant credit review, tenant delinquency reports, operating expense efficiency and property management efficiency) and local real estate market conditions including vacancy rates, absorption, new supply, rent levels and comparable sale transactions, as applicable.
In addition to evaluating the merits of any particular proposed investment, we evaluate the diversification of our portfolio of assets. Prior to making a final investment decision, we determine whether a target asset will cause our portfolio of assets to be too heavily concentrated with, or cause too much risk exposure to, any one real estate sector, geographic region, source of cash flow such as tenants or borrowers, or other geopolitical issues. If we determine that a proposed investment presents excessive concentration risk, we may decide not to pursue an otherwise attractive investment. 
Portfolio Management
Our Manager performs portfolio management services on our behalf. In addition, we rely on the services of local third-party service providers. The comprehensive portfolio management process includes day-to-day oversight by the portfolio management team, regular management meetings and a quarterly investment review process. These processes are designed to enable management to evaluate and proactively identify investment-specific issues and trends on a portfolio-wide basis. Nevertheless, we cannot be certain that such review will identify all potential issues within our portfolio due to, among other things, adverse economic conditions or events adversely affecting specific investments; therefore, potential future losses may also stem from investments that are not identified during these investment reviews.
Our Manager uses many methods to actively manage our risks to seek to preserve our income and capital, which includes our ability to manage our investments and our tenants in a manner that preserves cost and income and minimizes credit losses that could decrease income and portfolio value. Frequent re-underwriting, dialogue with tenants/partners and regular inspections of our properties have proven to be an effective process for identifying issues early. Monitoring tenant creditworthiness is an important component of our portfolio management process, which may include, to the extent available, a review of financial statements and operating statistics, delinquencies, third party ratings and market data. During the quarterly portfolio review, or more frequently as necessary, investments may be put on highly-monitored status and identified for possible asset impairment based upon several factors, including missed or late contractual payments, tenant rating downgrades (where applicable) and other data that may indicate a potential issue in our ability to recover our invested capital from an investment.
We may need to make unplanned capital expenditures in connection with changes in laws and governmental regulations in relation to real estate. Where properties are being repositioned or refurbished, we may be exposed to unforeseen changes in scope to budgeted capital expenditures.
Given our need to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and in order to maximize returns and manage portfolio risk, we may dispose of an asset earlier than anticipated or hold an asset longer than anticipated if we determine it to be appropriate depending upon prevailing market conditions or factors regarding a particular asset. We can provide no assurances, however, that we will be successful in identifying or managing all of the risks associated with acquiring, holding or disposing of a particular asset or that we will not realize losses on certain assets.
8

Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Hedging 
Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may mitigate the risk of interest rate volatility through the use of hedging instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements. The goal of our interest rate management strategy is to minimize or eliminate the effects of interest rate changes on the value of our assets, to improve risk-adjusted returns and, where possible, to lock in, on a long-term basis, a favorable spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of financing such assets. 
In addition, because we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we employ foreign currency risk management strategies, including the use of, among others, currency hedges, and matched currency financing. 
We can provide no assurances, however, that our efforts to manage interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility will successfully mitigate the risks of such volatility on our portfolio.
Regulation
We are subject, in certain circumstances, to supervision and regulation by international, federal, state and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things:
•    regulate our public disclosures, reporting obligations and capital raising activity; 
•    require compliance with applicable REIT rules;
•    regulate credit granting activities; 
•    require disclosures to customers; 
•    govern secured transactions; 
•    set collection, taking title to collateral, repossession and claims-handling procedures and other trade practices; 
•    regulate land use and zoning; 
•    regulate the foreign ownership or management of real property or mortgages;

• | regulate the ability of foreign persons or corporations to remove profits earned from activities within the country to the person’s or corporation’s country of origin;

•    regulate tax treatment and accounting standards; and

• | regulate use of derivative instruments and our ability to hedge our risks related to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates.

We qualified to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, beginning with the year ended December 31, 2015 upon filing our initial U.S. federal income tax. As a REIT, we must currently distribute, at a minimum, an amount equal to 90% of our taxable income. In addition, we must distribute 100% of our taxable income to avoid paying corporate U.S. federal income taxes. REITs are also subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements in order to elect and maintain REIT status. These requirements include specific share ownership tests and assets and gross income composition tests. If we fail to continue to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to tax in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or own property and state and local income taxes and to U.S. federal income tax and excise tax on our undistributed income. 
We believe that we are not, and intend to conduct our operations so as not to become regulated as, an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. We have relied, and intend to continue to rely on current interpretations of the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, in an effort to continue to qualify for an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act. For more information on the exemptions that we use refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Regulatory Matters and Our REIT Tax Status.” 
Real estate properties owned by us and the operations of such properties are subject to various international laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. In addition, such properties are required to comply with applicable fire and safety regulations, building codes, legal or regulatory provisions regarding access to our properties for persons with disabilities and other land use regulations. For further information regarding environmental matters, refer to “Environmental Matters” below. 
9

In addition, we currently own two hotels, leased to third-party operators, which are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas. We believe each of our hotels have the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business. 
In the judgment of management, while we do incur significant expense complying with the various regulations to which we are subject, existing statutes and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our business. However, it is not possible to forecast the nature of future legislation, regulations, judicial decisions, orders or interpretations, nor their impact upon our future business, financial condition and results of operations or prospects. 
Environmental Matters 
A wide variety of environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect our properties. These complex laws, and their enforcement, involve a myriad of regulations, many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender. Some of these laws may directly impact us. Under various local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property, such as us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property, and/or the assets of the owner. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, could reduce our revenues.
Selected Regulations Regarding our Operations in Germany, the United Kingdom and France
Our commercial real estate investments are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in Europe. If we fail to comply with any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil liability, administrative orders, fines or even criminal sanctions. The following provides a brief overview of selected regulations that are applicable to our business operations in Germany, the United Kingdom and France, where a majority of our properties in terms of contribution to rental income are located. 
Germany
Land-use Regulations, Building Regulations and Tenancy Law for Commercial Properties
Land-use Regulations. There are several regulations regarding the use of land including German planning law and urban restructuring planning by communities. 
Urban Restructuring Planning. Communities may designate certain areas as restructuring areas and undertake comprehensive modernization efforts regarding the infrastructure in such areas. While this may improve the value of properties located in restructuring areas, being located in a restructuring area also imposes certain limitations on the affected properties (e.g., the sale, encumbrance and leasing of such properties, as well as reconstruction and refurbishment measures, are generally subject to special consent by municipal authorities).
Building Regulations.  German building laws and regulations are quite comprehensive and address a number of issues, including, but not limited to, permissible types of buildings, building materials, proper workmanship, heating, fire safety, means of warning and escape in case of emergency, access and facilities for the fire department, hazardous and offensive substances, noise protection, ventilation and access and facilities for disabled people. Owners of erected buildings may be required to conduct alterations or improvements of the property if safety or health risks with respect to users of the building or the general public occur, including fire risks, traffic risks, risks of collapse and health risks from injurious building materials such as asbestos. To our knowledge, there are currently no official orders demanding any alterations to existing buildings owned by us.
Tenancy Law for Commercial Properties. German tenancy laws for commercial properties generally provide landlords and tenants with far-reaching discretion in how they structure lease agreements and use general terms and conditions. Certain legal restrictions apply with regard to the strict written form requirements regarding the lease agreement and any addenda thereto, transfer of operating costs and maintenance costs, cosmetic repairs and final decorative repairs. Lease agreements with a term of more than one year must be executed in writing or are deemed to have been concluded for an indefinite period. As a consequence, and regardless of the contractually agreed lease term, such lease agreements can then be terminated by the lessor or the lessee at the end of one year turning over the leased property to the lessee at the earliest, and on the third working day of a calendar quarter to the end of the following calendar quarter thereafter. Subject to certain exceptions, operating costs of commercial tenancies may be apportioned to the tenants if the lease agreement stipulates explicitly and specifically which operating costs shall be borne by the tenant. Responsibility for maintenance and repair costs may be transferred to tenants, except for the full cost transfer of maintenance and repair costs for roof, structures and areas used by several tenants in general terms and conditions. Expenses for cosmetic repairs (Schönheitsreparaturen) may, in principle, be allocated to tenants, provided that the obligation to carry out ongoing cosmetic repairs is not combined with an undertaking to perform initial and/or final decorative repairs. German law considers standardized terms to be invalid if they are not clear and comprehensive or if they are disproportionate and provide an unreasonable 
10

disadvantage for the other party. For example, clauses allocating decorative repair costs and ancillary costs have been subject to extensive case law in Germany. 
Regulation Relating to Environmental Damage and Contamination 
The portion of our commercial real estate portfolio located in Germany is subject to various rules and regulations relating to the remediation of environmental damage and contamination. 
Soil Contamination. Pursuant to the German Federal Soil Protection Act (Bundesbodenschutzgesetz), the responsibility for residual pollution and harmful changes to soil, or Contamination, lies with, among others, the perpetrator of the Contamination, such perpetrator’s universal successor, the current owner of the property, the party in actual control of the property and, if the title was transferred after March 1999, the previous owner of the property if such owner knew or should have known about the Contamination, or the Liable Persons. The Liable Person that carried out the remediation work may claim indemnification on a pro rata basis from the other Liable Persons. Independently, from the aforementioned liability, civil law liability for Contaminations can arise from contractual warranty provisions or statutory law. 
United Kingdom
For a discussion of the impact of regulations in the United Kingdom, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Financing Strategy- “We are subject to risks associated with obtaining mortgage financing on our real estate, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders.” 
France
Participation in an Organismes de placement collectif en immobilier 
We hold participations in Organismes de placement collectif en immobilier, or OPCIs, each of which takes the form of a Société de Placement à Prépondérance Immobilière à Capital Variable, or SPPICAV. Both the SPPICAV and its management company, Swiss Life Reim (France), are authorized and supervised by the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. 
Commercial Lease Regulation
The contractual conditions applying to commercial lease periods, renewal, rent and rent indexation are heavily regulated. The minimum duration of commercial leases is nine years. We cannot terminate the lease before such period, except in very specific cases (such as reconstructing or elevating an existing building). The tenant, on the other hand, has the power to terminate the lease at the end of each three-year period, subject to a six-month prior notice requirement. However, in leases of premises to be used exclusively as office spaces, such power of the tenant can be contractually removed. 
The tenant has also a right of renewal of the lease at the end of its initial period and a right to a revision of the rent every three years. The rent variation is capped. Except in the case where the rental value considerably changes (increase by more than 10% in case of a revision upon a three-year period), the variation of the rent, in case of a revision upon a three-year period or in case of a renewal, cannot exceed the variation of the Commercial Rents Index (indice trimestriel des loyers commerciaux) or the Retail Rental Index (indice trimestriel des loyers des activités tertiaires). However, this provision does not apply in case of a renewal of a lease, the initial duration of which exceeded nine years or the effective duration of which exceeded twelve years. In addition, even in the case of a renewed or revised lease where the rental value has considerably changed, the rent increase cannot exceed 10% of the rent paid during the previous year. 
Moreover, the tenant has a right of first refusal if the leased premises are offered for sale. 
The legal distribution of charges between us and the tenant can be contractually determined. However, articles L. 145-40-2 and R. 145-35 of the French commercial code, which result from French law no. 2014-626 of June 18, 2014, make it mandatory for the property owner in leases entered into on or after November 3, 2014 to incur expenditures for major repairs, in particular those related to the obsolescence of the properties and those required to meet changing legal regulation. It also forces the property owner to incur certain taxes. 
Bankruptcy Law
In France, a safeguarding (sauvegarde), judicial restructuring (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation (liquidation) procedure commencement order against an insolvent tenant does not lead to the automatic termination of the lease. In such cases, we will not be able to get paid directly by the tenant any rent due before the commencement order. Furthermore, the tenant, via the insolvency court appointed receiver, will have the choice to continue or reject any unexpired lease. If the tenant chooses to continue an unexpired lease, but still fails to pay the rent in connection with the occupancy after the issue of the commencement order, we cannot legally request the termination of the lease before the end of a three-month period from the date of issue of the commencement order.
11

Environmental Law
In France, our investments are subject to regulations regarding the accessibility of buildings to persons with disabilities, public health and the environment, covering a number of areas, including the ownership and use of classified facilities, the use, storage, and handling of hazardous materials in building construction; inspections for asbestos, lead, and termites; inspection of gas and electricity facilities; assessments of energy efficiency; and assessments of technological and natural risks.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Act, or JOBS Act and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” These exemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
We have availed ourselves of some of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to us as long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, except that we have irrevocably elected not to take advantage of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b) of the JOBS Act. 
We will, in general, remain as an emerging growth company for up to five full fiscal years following December 31, 2015. We would cease to be an emerging growth company and, therefore, become ineligible to rely on the above exemptions, if we:

• | have more than $1 billion in annual revenue in a fiscal year;


• | issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period; or


• | become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2, which would occur at the end of the fiscal year after: (i) we have filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Exchange Act; (ii) we have been an SEC-reporting company for at least 12 months; and (iii) the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.

Competition
We are subject to increased competition in seeking investments. We compete with many third parties engaged in real estate investment activities including publicly-traded REITs, insurance companies, commercial and investment banking firms, private equity funds, sovereign wealth funds and other investors. Some of these competitors, including other REITS and private real estate companies and funds, have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Such competitors may also enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. 
Future competition from new market entrants may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us. It may also result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to originate or acquire new investments on attractive terms. 
Employees
We are externally managed by our Manager and do not have our own employees.
Available Information and Corporate Governance 
We emphasize the importance of professional business conduct and ethics through our corporate governance initiatives. Our board of directors consists of a majority of independent directors; the audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees of the board of directors are composed exclusively of independent directors. We have adopted corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics, which delineate our standards for our officers, directors and employees.

We make available, free of charge through a link on our website, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to such reports, if any, as filed or furnished with the SEC, as soon as reasonably practicable after such filing or furnishing. We also post corporate presentations on our website from time-to-time. Our website further contains our code of business conduct and ethics, code of ethics for senior financial officers, corporate governance guidelines and the charters of our audit committee, nominating and corporate governance committee and compensation committee of our board of directors. Within the time period required by the rules of the SEC and the NYSE we will post on our website any amendment to our code of business conduct and ethics and our code of ethics for senior financial officers as defined in the code.
