ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
SUMMARY
 
Who We Are and What We Do
 Applied Minerals, Inc. (the “Company” or “Applied Minerals”) (OTCQB: AMNL) (OTCBB: AMNL) owns the Dragon Mine in central Utah from which we extract, process and market halloysite clay and iron oxide for sale to a range of end markets. We also engage in research and development and frequently work collaboratively with potential customers, consultants, distributors, and third party processors to engineer and enhance our halloysite clay and iron oxide products to improve the performance of our customers’ existing and new products. 
Halloysite 
 Our halloysite clay, which we market under the DRAGONITE™ trade name, is aluminosilicate clay with a hollow tubular shape. DRAGONITE can utilize halloysite’s shape, high surface area, and reactivity to add significant functionality to a number of applications, including molecular sieves and catalysts, nucleation and/or reinforcement of polymers, fire retardant additives for plastics, and cement. 
Iron Oxide
 Our iron oxide, which we market under the AMIRON™ tradename, is a high purity product. We currently sell it as an absorbent for hydrogen sulfide gas contained in natural gas. We believe that the high purity of the Dragon Mine’s iron oxide resource positions it to be able to compete cost effectively in the pigment market with higher-cost synthetic iron oxides as a colorant for mulch (typically made out of bark chips) and for other uses.
Sales
 In 2016, we recorded revenues of $4,013,134. We currently have seven customers for our halloysite and one customer for our iron oxide. 
 
Characterization of the Mineralization; Research and Development
 Over the last eight years, the Company has expended significant resources to determine the amount, character and mineabilitiy of the mineralization of the deposits at the Dragon Mine. 
 
We have also expended significant resources on research and development that focused on exploiting the unique shape and high purity of the Dragon Mine’s mineral resources to develop high-value, eco-friendly solutions. Such solutions either enhance product performance at minimal additional cost or reduce manufacturing costs without sacrificing product performance. We believe that DRAGONITE and AMIRON offer solutions that accomplish both of these objectives.
 
Classification for SEC Purposes
 The Company is classified as an “exploration stage” company for purposes of Industry Guide 7 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Under Industry Guide 7, companies engaged in significant mining operations are classified into three categories, referred to as “stages” - exploration, development, and production. Exploration stage includes all companies that do not have established reserves in accordance with Industry Guide 7. Such companies are deemed to be “in the search for mineral deposits.” Notwithstanding the nature and extent of development-type or production-type activities that have been undertaken or completed, a company cannot be classified as a development or production stage company unless it has established reserves in accordance with Industry Guide 7. The mineralization indicated by the resource study (described below) we have commissioned is not a reserve for purpose of Industry Guide 7.
 
Processing Capability
 We have a mineral processing plant with a capacity of up to 45,000 tons per annum for certain applications. Currently, this facility is dedicated to processing our iron oxide resource. Additionally, the Company has a second processing facility with a capacity of up to 10,000 tons per annum that is dedicated to its halloysite resource. 
 
At the Dragon Mine, we use a dry beneficiation method to process our halloysite products through a micronizing system. Wet processing of halloysite is available through toll processors. 
 
We use a third party processer to convert our iron oxide into pigments.

The Dragon Mine is a 267-acre property located in central Utah, approximately 70 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah.
 
We market our halloysite clay-based line of products under the tradename DRAGONITE. We market our iron oxide line of products under the tradename AMIRON.
 

INFORMATION ABOUT THE DRAGON MINE
 
History of the Dragon Mine
 
The Dragon Mine was first mined in the third quarter of the 19th century. It has since been mined by various owners and operators. It was mined for iron oxide from the late nineteenth century until approximately 1931 and it was mined for halloysite clay from approximately 1931 to 1976. From 1949 to 1976, the halloysite was sold for use as a petroleum cracking catalyst. A fire closed the mine in 1976. No mining took place from 1976 until 2001, at which point the Company leased the property with an option to buy it. The Company purchased the property in 2005.
 
The Company acquired the Dragon Mine primarily to exploit the mine’s halloysite resources. At the time that the Dragon Mine was acquired, it was assumed that the iron oxide mineralization would be useful only for steelmaking. Given historical price conditions and our method of mining (underground), sales of iron oxide for steelmaking would often not be economic and at best would yield marginal or low profits.
 
Prior to a change in management in 2009, the Company did relatively little to explore the mineralization at the Dragon Mine or to identify and exploit markets for the minerals. Since new management was installed in 2009, the Company has been using a consulting geologist to categorize the mineralization at the Dragon Mine and management has identified and begun to develop and exploit markets for halloysite and iron oxide.
 
As a result of categorizing the iron oxide mineralization, we believe the iron oxide deposit at the Dragon Mine is a high-quality deposit (due to its high Fe2O3 content, relative chemical purity, good dispersibility, good tinting strength and color saturation, low content of heavy metals, and high surface area, (25 m2/g – 125 m2/g) and reactivity). 
 
Resource Study of the Dragon Mine’s Mineralization
 

  There are two areas of the Dragon Mine minesite at which mining is conducted and they are referred to the “Dragon Pit” are and the “Western Area.” In addition, there are five surface piles on the site, mineralization that was left by prior operators.
 
The Company has commissioned an ongoing study (and updates) of the mine’s “resources” that was conducted using the standards of the JORC Code of the Australasian Code for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. We will refer to the 2013 update as the “study.” The Company has commissioned a further update of the study to consider new information including the ability to wet process halloysite to eliminate substantially all iron oxide in halloysite products and to reevaluate past data and conclusions, in part because of the need to use of a different modeling system to determine tonnage. As a result, there will be changes to the information discussed below. So the information below should be considered preliminary.
  
The study indicated the existence of JORC “resources” of halloysite clay and iron oxide. Under the JORC Code, resource tonnages are reported in situ (in the ground) and are not net of (i) diluting materials or (ii) losses due to the mining process or (iii) losses due to processing to turn the mined mineral into saleable product.
   A JORC resource is defined is a “mineral deposit in such form, grade…and quantity that there are reasonable for prospects for eventual economic extraction.”   There are three levels of resources, differentiated by the level of confidence and they are in ascending order of confidence: inferred, indicated, and measured.
 
A JORC indicated resource is an economic mineral occurrence that has been sampled (from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits and boreholes) to a point where an estimate has been made, at a reasonable level of confidence, of its contained metal, grade, tonnage, shape, densities, and physical characteristics. 
 
A JORC measured resource is an indicated resource that has undergone enough further sampling to be an acceptable estimate, at a high degree of confidence, of the grade, tonnage, shape, densities, physical characteristics and mineral content of the mineral occurrence.
 The results of the study are summarized below. The tonnages in the Dragon Pit, the Western Area, and in Surface Pile #1 are considered “measured” resources. The tonnages in Waste Piles #2 - #5 are considered “indicated” resources.

The study was performed by Ian Wilson, Ph.D. as our consulting geologist. Dr. Wilson has supervised our drilling program. Dr. Wilson is a member of iom3 (Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining of the UK). From 1974 to 2001 Mr. Wilson worked with English China Clays/Imerys mainly as a geologist and with management roles in Brazil, Spain, Sweden and China. Since his retirement in 2001, he has worked as an independent consultant dealing with many industrial minerals including halloysite. 
 
Dragon Pit
 
The Dragon Pit area covers 4.95 acres and is mined underground. There are three separate types of mineralized material in the Dragon Pit area. 
 
The first type is comprised of clay with a relatively high concentration (approximately 94%) of halloysite. The Dragon Pit contains 629,650 tons of this type of mineralized material.
 
The second type is comprised of a mix of kaolinite, illite-smectite, and halloysite clays.  Clays constitute approximately 73.4% of this mineralization, of which halloysite constitutes approximately 42.6%, kaolinite constitutes 19.2% and illite-smectite constitutes 11.6%.  The Dragon Pit contains 565,575 tons of this type of mineralized material.
 
The third type of mineralized material found in the Dragon Pit is comprised of iron-bearing materials.  This mineralization contains goethite and hematite. When dehydrated, goethite forms hematite. We will sometimes refer to either minerals or combinations of the minerals as “iron oxide.”  The mineralization is approximately 94% iron oxide, of which goethite accounts for 69.7% and hematite 24.3%. There exist separate areas of goethite and hematite but the majority of the iron-bearing mineralization in the Dragon Pit exists as a goethite-hematite mix. The Dragon Pit contains 3,254,989 tons of this iron-bearing mineralization.
 
The table below describes the clay resource in the Dragon Pit:
 

Area | Acres | | Resource Status | | Clay (Tons) | Clay Type | Average Clay Content (%)
-----------+-------+------+-----------------+----------+-------------+-------------+-------------------------
 | | | | | | 629,650 | Pure | Halloysite | | Kaolinite | | Illite-Smectite | Total
Dragon Pit | | 4.95 | | Measured | | | Halloysite | | 94.0 | | N/A | | N/A | 94.0
 | | | | | | 565,575 (1) | Mixed | | 42.6 | | 19.2 | | 11.6 | 73.4


(1) | The amount is the result of processing to < 45 microns, which eliminated 27% of the starting unprocessed material. The material would have to be wet processed so that the >45 micron material can be removed. The pure halloysite is used in our DRAGONITE products and mixed clays are not used in our DRAGONITE products.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The table below describes the iron oxide resource in the Dragon Pit:
 

 | | | | Resource | | Iron Oxide | | | Average Content (%)
-----------+-------+------+--------+----------+--------+------------+-----------+----------+--------------------
Area | Acres | | Status | | (Tons) | | | Hematite | | Goethite | Fe2O3 | | LOI (1)
Dragon Pit | | 4.95 | | Measured | | | 3,254,989 | | | 29.16 | | 63.54 | | 77.47 | 10.09


(1) | LOI, or Loss on Ignition, is a test used in inorganic analytical chemistry, particularly in the analysis of minerals. It consists of strongly heating ("igniting") a sample of the material at a specified temperature, allowing volatile substances (such as water) to escape, until its mass ceases to change. LOI is generally described as the amount of moisture and trapped volatile oxides or carbonates present in the ore.

Western Area 
 
The Western area covers 6.33 acres and is mined underground.  There are two different types of mineralization in the Western Area.
 
One type of mineralization in the Western Area is clay. It is comprised primarily of a mix of kaolinite, illite-smectite, and halloysite clays. The clay content of this mineralization is approximately 71.4%, of which kaolinite constitutes 47.2%, illite-smectite constitutes 17.5%, and halloysite constitutes 6.7%. The Western Area contains 862,903 tons of this type of mineralization.
 
The other type of mineralization is iron bearing.  The Western Area contains goethite and hematite. The mineralization is approximately 96% iron oxide on a mineralogical basis, of which hematite accounts for 75.9% and goethite 20.1%.  There exist separate areas of goethite and hematite but the majority of the iron-bearing mineralization in the Western Area exists as a goethite-hematite mix. The Western Area contains 797,717 tons of this iron-bearing mineralization.

Western Area | 6.33 | Measured | | 797,717 | | 60.03 | | 30.7 | | 8.29 | | 8.04

Surface Piles
 
There are five surface piles that were created during the mining of halloysite clay between 1949 and 1976 when the Dragon Mine’s halloysite resource for use as a petroleum cracking catalyst.  Any clay that contained more than a minimal amount (~ 2%) of iron oxide was not usable for petroleum cracking and was discarded into one of five surface piles. 
  
The following sets forth information about the mineralized material by surface pile:
 

 | | | | | Average Clay Content (%) | 
-------------+-----------------+-------------+---------+------------+--------------------------+-----
Surface Pile | Resource Status | Clay (Tons) | | Halloysite | | | Kaolinite | Illite-Smectite | Total |

These clays are not used in our DRAGONITE products. 
 
In addition to the surface pile material described above, there is a surface pile of approximately 20,000 tons of mined iron oxide on the surface of the Dragon Mine property.

   Resource Development/Exploration Drilling Expenses
 
In 2016 and 2015, the Company spent $981,045 and $3,997,039, respectively, on exploration and resource development.
 
More Detailed Description of the Mineralization at the Dragon Mine
 
Clays. Kaolinite and halloysite are clays and members of the kaolin group of clays. Both are aluminosilicate clays. Kaolinite and halloysite are essentially chemically identical, but have different morphologies (shapes). Kaolinite typically appears in plates or sheets. Halloysite, in contrast, typically appears in the shape of hollow tubes. On average, the halloysite tubes have a length in the range of 0.5 - 3.0 microns, an exterior diameter in the range of 50 - 70 nanometers and an internal diameter (lumen) in the range of 15 - 30 nanometers. Formation of halloysite occurs when kaolinite sheets roll into tubes due to the strain caused by a lattice mismatch between the adjacent silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide layers. Halloysite is non-toxic and natural, demonstrating high biocompatibility without posing any risk to the environment.
 
Kaolinite is one of the world’s most common minerals. U.S. production in 2014 was approximately 6.3 million tons.
 
Halloysite is, by comparison, a rarer mineral and we believe worldwide production is less than 25,000 tons.
 
Illite refers to a group of clays that includes hydrous micas, phengite, brammalite, celadonite, and glauconite. Illite clays are common and large amounts are produced each year.
 
Smectite refers to a group of clays that includes montmorillonite, bentonite, nontronite, hectorite, saponite and sauconite. Smectite clays are common clay and large amounts are produced each year.
 
Iron Oxide. Hematite is the mineral form of iron oxide, which exists in a range of colors, including black to steel or silver-gray and brown to reddish brown, or red.
 
Geothite is an iron hydroxide oxide mineral, which exists in a range of colors, including yellowish to reddish to dark brown. If goethite is sufficiently heated to eliminate its contained water, it is transformed into hematite.
 
Mixtures of goethite and hematite are the color brown.

STATUS OF THE COMPANY FOR SEC REPORTING PURPOSES
 
The Company is classified as an “exploration stage” company for purposes of Industry Guide 7 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Under Industry Guide 7, companies engaged in significant mining operations are classified into three categories, referred to as “stages” - exploration, development, and production. 
 
Exploration stage includes all companies engaged in the search for mineral deposits (that is, reserves), which are not in either the development or production stage. In order to be classified as a development or production stage company, the company must have already established reserves. Notwithstanding the nature and extent of development-type or production-type activities that have been undertaken or completed, a company cannot be classified as a development or production stage company unless it has established reserves. 
 
Under Industry Guide 7, a “reserve” is “that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.” Generally speaking, a company may not declare reserves, unless, among other requirements, a competent professional engineer conducts a detailed engineering and economic study and prepares a “bankable” or “final” feasibility study that “demonstrates that a mineral deposit can be mined profitably at a commercial rate.”
 
The Company commissioned a study of “resources” under the JORC Code of the Australasian Code for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. That study indicated the existence of JORC “resources” of halloysite clay and iron oxide. A JORC resource is defined is a “mineral deposit in such form, grade and quantity that there are reasonable for prospects for eventual economic extraction,” a lower standard than that used for a final feasibility study. Among the differences between resources determined under the JORC Code and Industry Guide 7 is that under the JORC Code resources are measured in situ and are not net of diluting materials and mining losses, while under Industry Guide 7, reserves are net of diluting materials and mining losses. The results of the study are not net of mining and processing losses.
 
Despite the fact that the Company has not established reserves for purposes of Industry Guide 7, the Company has mined, processed and sold, and intends to continue to mine, process, and sell halloysite clay and iron oxide from the Dragon Mine. 
 
A consequence of the absence of reserves under Industry Guide 7 is that the mining company, such as the Company, is deemed to lack an objective basis to assert that it has a deposit with mineralization that can be economically and legally extracted or produced and sold to produce revenue.
 
PROCESSING FACILITIES AT THE DRAGON MINE
 
We have a mineral processing plant with a capacity of up to 45,000 tons per annum for certain applications. Currently, this facility is dedicated to processing our iron oxide resource. Typically, the processing involves a preliminary step of crushing the iron oxide in a crusher and a further step of pulverizing the iron oxide in our Hosokawa Alpine table roller mill. Depending on the customer’s specifications, if we need to only process the iron oxide through the preliminary step of crushing, our production capacity would be significantly greater than 45,000 tons per annum. We use a third party processor to further process our processed iron oxide for pigments and in particular for mulch coloring.
 
If demand for halloysite increases beyond our current capacity, we may choose to use a third-party to wet process or, if funds are available, invest in more or different processing capacity.

CUSTOMERS
 
AMIRON
 
At the current time, we are selling AMIRON iron oxide to one customer on an ongoing basis. That customer uses the AMIRON as a catalyst to adsorb a gas. The agreement with that Company calls for the sale of $5.0 million of AMIRON over a period of 18 months, which commenced in December, 2015. Through December, 2016 the Company sold approximately $3.7 million of the $5.0 million of AMIRON required by the agreement. The Company has agreed not to sell AMIRON to other customers for use in the same application for five years. The customer may elect to make another $5 million purchase at the end of five years and extend the exclusivity for this application for a total of ten years.
 
In 2015, we sold 20 tons of AMIRON to two other customers for use in commercial sales (as opposed to testing); one of the customers used the AMIRON in a biogas application and the other used it in connection with stain dispersion. The Company received no adverse feedback from such customers.
 
The Company is exploring whether AMIRON can be sold as an effective and cost-efficient substitute or partial substitute for barite as a weighting agent in certain drilling fluids used in the production of oil and gas. There is no certainty that the Company will be successful in penetrating this market.
 
The path to commercialization begins with testing by the customer and ends with a customer’s decision to commercialize the product after pilot scale production trials and, in certain cases, commercial scale production trials. The Company is working with many potential customers and individual potential customers are at different stages of the commercialization process. There is no certainty that any potential customer who tests our products will actually become a customer on an ongoing basis.
 
DRAGONITE
 
At the current time, the Company is selling halloysite on an ongoing basis to seven customers. One customer uses the halloysite to manufacture a specialty zeolite, which is used in an adsorption application. The initial purchase order of $228,000 was placed in 2015. The Company also sells to three ceramic companies that use the halloysite as a binder; to a large manufacturing company that uses the halloysite in structural acrylic adhesives; to a customer that uses the halloysite to strengthen epoxy resins; and to a large manufacturer that uses the halloysite for nucleation in extruded polymers.
 
There is no certainty that any potential customer who tests our products will actually become a customer on an ongoing basis. The Company currently is cautiously optimistic that additional customers could become ongoing customers with additional revenue in 2016 or early 2017.
 
Sales by Customer Use
 The table below discloses the percentage of total revenue by product category for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. “Testing” represents revenue generated from the sale of products used for laboratory testing by customers or potential customers. “Scale-Ups” represents revenue generated from the sale of products to customers or potential customers to determine whether our products perform successfully within a production-scale environment. “Commercial Production” represents revenue generated from the sale of products to customers that are either consumed by the costumer or incorporated into a product that is sold by a customer to a third-party. “Other” represents revenue generated from the sale of products for which the Company is not aware of the use by a potential customer.

APPLICATION MARKETS
 
The following discusses the markets into which the Company is marketing its DRAGONITE and AMIRON products. It cannot be assured that we will be successful penetrating these markets. The discussion does not discuss certain problems of selling into these markets, which are discussed elsewhere in the Business section or in the Risk Factors section.
DRAGONITE
 
The following is a description of the application markets to which the Company is marketing its halloysite-based DRAGONITE products:
 
Molecular Sieves and Catalyst.
 
Molecular Sieves. A molecular sieve is a material with very small holes of precise and uniform size. These holes are small enough to block large molecules while allowing small molecules to pass. Many molecular sieves are used as desiccants (substances that induce or sustain a state of dryness). Zeolites are a form of molecular sieve that are crystalline with a skeletal composed of aluminosilicates. We believe that DRAGONITE works very well with zeolites and helps entrap water and impurities both within halloysite’s hollow tubular structure as well as the porous outer walls, enhancing the drying of natural gas and air, the separation of liquid from product streams, and the separation of impurities from a gas stream.
 
Catalysts. Halloysite can be used as a catalyst for fluid cracking for oil and in methane to olephin. Crude oil petroleum must be processed in order to make it into gasoline and other fuels. Part of that process includes cracking, whereby large are two general types of cracking, thermal and catalytic. Catalytic cracking involves the addition of a catalyst to speed up the cracking. The reactive nature of halloysite lends itself to being an effective catalyst especially for high sulfur oil. Halloysite can also be used as a support for catalysts, which are applied to the halloysite as a coating.
 
Halloysite from the Dragon Mine was mined and processed as a catalyst for petroleum cracking from 1949 to 1976.
  
Nucleation of Polymers; Reinforcement of Polymers
 
Nucleation. Plastics and polymers are composed of long molecular chains that form irregular, entangled coils in a melted resin, the phase in which a resin is liquid and its molecules can move about freely. In semi-crystalline polymers, the chains rearrange upon freezing and form partly ordered regions. Examples of semi-crystalline polymers are polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), Nylon 6 and Nylon 6-6. Crystallization of a polymer occurs as a result of nucleation, a process that starts with small, nanometer-sized domains upon which the polymer chains arrange in an orderly manner to develop larger crystals. The overall rate of crystallization of a polymer be can increased by a nucleating agent. In plastic molding processes, especially in injection molding, the plastic part must remain in the mold until crystallization is complete (freezing). To the extent that crystallization is accelerated, the time in the mold can be reduced, thereby resulting in productivity enhancement. We believe that DRAGONITE added to a resin at a loading of just 1% can significantly speed up the process of crystallization.
 
We believe DRAGONITE can be effective as a nucleating agent for both polyethylene and polypropylene.
 
Reinforcement Fillers. Many plastics are reinforced with a filler to enhance the mechanical properties of a polymer. Reinforced plastics, in certain instances, can compete with stiffer materials like metal while also offering an opportunity to reduce the weight of a manufactured part (“light-weighting”).
 
We believe that the utilization of DRAGONITE as a reinforcing filler results in the improvement of one or more mechanical properties of a polymer such as modulus (the measure of how well a polymer resists breaking when pulled apart), strength (the measure of the stress needed to break a polymer), and impact resistance (the measure of a polymer’s resistance when impacted by a sharp and sudden stress) and can offer a value proposition when compared to certain traditional fillers.

Flame Retardant Additives

Flame retardants are widely used in flammable and flame resistant plastics and are found in electronics, building insulation, polyurethane foam, and wire and cable.  
 
Plastic manufacturers typically mix or load a small amount of flame retardant into plastic to lower the risk of flammability of their products. We believe that DRAGONITE can be used as a partial replacement for Alumina Trihydrate (ATH) and Magnesium Hydroxide (MDH) in certain applications and as a synergist to ATH and MDH in other applications. 
 
At typical loadings, ATH and MDH can adversely affect certain mechanical properties of plastics. We believe that DRAGONITE, in conjunction with ATH and MDH, exhibits a synergistic performance. Our research and development indicates that DRAGONITE can be used to replace 50% - 75% of antimony trioxide (ATO) in plastic without affecting flame retardancy, retaining the same rating under UL 94, the Standard for Safety of Flammability of Plastic Materials for Parts in Devices and Appliances testing. 
 
Generally speaking, we believe the use of DRAGONITE instead of other fire retardant products should allow a manufacturer to use less fire retardant. In addition, using DRAGONITE may enable the manufacturer to reduce the weight of the manufactured part.
 
Other clays compete in the markets for partially replacing ATH, MDH, and ATO. 
 
Cementing
 
The Company markets its DRAGONITE product to the cement admixture market. Research demonstrates how DRAGONITE, when added to a cement formulation, results in significant improvements in tensile strength that are more than twice the improvements in compressive strength while also reducing in permeability.
Binders for Ceramics
 
DRAGONITE is an effective binder for traditional ceramic products (any of various hard, brittle, heat-resistant and corrosion-resistant materials made by shaping and then firing a nonmetallic mineral, such as clay, at a high temperature). Binders are substances that improve the mechanical strength of green ceramic bodies so they can pass through production steps before firing without breakage. We believe that DRAGONITE, when used as a binder, also effectuates an improvement in the casting rate of the ceramic manufacturing process. This would equate to an increase in manufacturing efficiency. 
Cosmetics
 
Halloysite in DRAGONITE has a tubular shape that may be suited for an array of cosmetic applications. We believe that the adsorptive nature of the halloysite found in halloysite clay can serve as a hypoallergenic skin cleanser capable of removing unwanted toxins and oils from the skin without the need for harsh chemicals; of halloysite is also capable of exfoliating the skin; and, halloysite has been shown to be capable of functioning as a non-irritating carrier and release mechanism of cosmetic ingredients for a long lasting application. 
Controlled Release Carriers
 
We believe that the halloysite present in DRAGONITE clay can act as an effective carrier of active ingredients, enabling an agent to be released from the carrier over an extended time frame. We believe that this controlled release capability can be utilized in oilfield applications, paints and coatings.
AMIRON
 
The Company markets its AMIRON line of natural iron oxide-based products to the pigmentary and technical application markets. The iron oxide resource at the Dragon Mine has a high content of Fe2O3, The iron oxide is of high chemical purity, possesses high surface area, fine grains, dispersability, good tinting strength, enhanced color saturation, low color variation, and a low level of heavy metals content, high surface area (25 m2/g – 125 m2/g and reactivity. For these reasons, we refer to the Dragon Mine’s iron oxide resource as an “advanced” natural iron oxide. 
Pigments.

We can produce natural iron oxide pigments. These compete with synthetic iron oxide pigments that are produced from basic chemicals. Synthetic iron oxides account for approximately 80% of the market; natural iron oxides account for approximately 20%. Generally speaking, synthetic iron oxides cost much more to produce than natural iron oxides and sell for prices significantly in excess of natural iron oxides. Traditionally, natural iron oxides, due to their variance in quality, have not been able to compete with synthetic in the pigment market. We believe that the consistency of purity (high level of Fe2O3), desirable dispersability, color consistency, and UV protection, as well as the lower price, of our iron oxide should enable us to compete to some extent with higher priced synthetic iron oxides.
 
The major focus of our efforts in the pigment area involves the use of pigments for mulch. We are currently working to perfect a formula that does not run in the rain. We also believe that our AMIRON pigments can be used for artistic paint, semi-transparent and opaque exterior wood stain, semi-transparent cosmetics, food contact colorants, and pharmaceutical applications. 
 
Technical Applications.

Among the technical applications for our AMIRON are the following: adsorbents (iron oxide can be used to remove arsenic, copper, lead, chromium, cadmium from drinking water) and to remove contaminants and moisture from gases (under a supply agreement, the Company may not sell, at least until 2020, iron oxide to remove hydrogen sulfide from liquids or gases). Other applications include iron oxide for use in agriculture, as an additive in pet food, and for use in steel casing in foundries.

THE SALES PROCESS
 
The Company sells its products using employees, agents, and distributors, selling on a global basis.
 
DRAGONITE
 
The Company markets its DRAGONITE into two general types of application markets.  
 
The first type is a market in which halloysite has not been previously used, or is to be used as an additive in substitution for another additive, to enhance certain functionality of an application.  This type of market requires a number of steps to be completed before a sale can be consummated.  Like any new material that will be incorporated into a commercial manufacturing process, a significant amount of testing must be performed by a customer before DRAGONITE can be incorporated into a manufacturing process and a product. Sales of this type require working with the potential customers’ existing formulations, which can vary from potential customer to potential customer. 
 
This could include identifying a solution, such as (i) surface coating or (ii) when to introduce DRAGONITE into the formulation or (iii) the conditions under which it should be introduced or (iv) changes, deletions, additions, or substitutions involving other elements of the customer’s formulation. Without the customer’s collaboration in identifying a solution, DRAGONITE could be unsuccessful in achieving the customer’s goals. This process can take an extended period of time (years in the case of discoloration of polymers as a result of the introduction of DRAGONITE) and, in some cases, there is no solution. In this type of market, price can be an important consideration and in some cases, we are not able to compete.
 
The second type of market is one in which halloysite clay is currently being used in traditional application markets.  Within these established markets, we believe our DRAGONITE products often offers an enhanced value proposition with respect to purity and other properties sought by customers, although in some cases DRAGONITE’s purity and/or other properties may not be required or useful.  The pricing of our products relative to those of our competitors, however, will always be a significant factor in determining our ability to penetrate these markets.
  
AMIRON
 
The Company encounters the same types of challenges marketing AMIRON, as it faces in marketing DRAGONITE. In particular, the Company must compete on price and quality in relation to competitive materials.
 
It cannot be assured that we will be successful in further penetrating these markets.
 
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
 
The Company’s research and development and testing efforts are focused on the continued creation of commercial applications for our halloysite-based products and our iron oxides. The Company conducts significant research and development efforts internally and occasionally through consultants. The Company also conducts product research and development collaboratively with customers and potential customers.
 
In 2016 and 2015, the Company spent $139,539 and $181,821 for testing and research, respectively.
 
TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS
 
We have trademarked the name DRAGONITE and AMIRON. We believe these trademarks are important to the successful marketing of our product offering.  We filed a Provisional Application for Patent in October, 2010 related to the use of nucleating agents in polyethylene. As of December 31, 2016, we have been granted this patent in Great Britain, Denmark, France and China. A patent is pending approval in the United States, Canada and Thailand.
REGULATION
 
The Utah Department of Natural Resources sets the guidelines for exploration and other mineral related activities based on provisions of the Mined Land Reclamation Act, Title 40-8, Utah Code Annotated 1953, as amended, and the General Rules and Rules of Practice and Procedures, R647-1 through R647-5.We have received a large mine permit from the Department.  The Company does not believe that such regulations, including environmental regulations, have or will adversely affect the Company’s business or have a material impact on capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company.
 
We carry a Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) license (#4202383) for the Dragon Mine and report as required to MSHA. The Company is subject to extensive regulation and periodic inspections by the Mine Safety and Health Administration, which was created by the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The regulations generally are designed to assure the health and safety of miners and our mine is periodically inspected by MSHA.  The Company does not believe that such regulations have or will materially adversely affect the Company’s business or have a material impact on capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company.
 
The clays that the Company mines, including halloysite, may contain various levels of crystalline silica when mined.  Crystalline silica is considered a hazardous substance under regulations promulgated by the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) and U.S. Mine Health and Safety Administration (MSHA) and as a result is subject to permissible exposure limits (PELs), both in the mine and at the workplaces of our customers.  The Company is required to provide Safety Data Sheets (SDS) at the mine and accompanying sales of products to customers. The Company must also apply hazard warning to labels of containers of the product sold to customers if levels of crystalline silica are present above specified thresholds.  Kaolin and halloysite are subject to PELs.

The EPA has stated that it is developing a test rule under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to require manufacturers (which would include the Company) of certain nanoscale materials including kaolin, halloysite, and alumina (which is present in the clays mined by the company) to conduct testing for health effects, ecological effects, and environmental fate, as well as provide material characterization data.  The impact of such a rule on the Company cannot be determined at this time.  It seems clear, however, that if the results of the testing of particular nanomaterials indicate adverse health, ecological, or environmental effects, the EPA may seek to regulate those nanomaterials more extensively.  Such regulation could include, among other things, limiting the uses of the nanoscale materials; requiring the use of personal protective equipment, such as impervious gloves and NIOSH approved respirators, and limiting environmental releases.  The EPA is developing a SNUR for nanoscale materials under TSCA.
