Industry Segments
Our segments include regulated utility, retail energy-marketing, commercial energy systems and midstream energy services. Transactions and activities not specifically identified in one of these four segments are reported as “Other Activities.” The four segments are described below.
REGULATED UTILITY SEGMENT
The regulated utility segment consists of Washington Gas and Hampshire and represents approximately 75% of WGL’s total assets. Operating revenues related to gas sales and deliveries to external customers were approximately $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion, and $1.3 billion in fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Washington Gas Light Company
Washington Gas is a regulated public utility that sells and delivers natural gas to retail customers in accordance with tariffs approved by regulatory commissions in the District of Columbia and adjoining areas in Maryland, Virginia and several cities and towns in the northern Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. Washington Gas has been engaged in the natural gas distribution business since its incorporation by an Act of Congress in 1848. Washington Gas has been a Virginia corporation since 1953 and a corporation of the District of Columbia since 1957.
Washington Gas provides regulated distribution or delivery of natural gas to retail customers under tariff rates designed to provide for a return on and return of the investment used in providing that service. The rates are also designed to provide for recovery of operating expenses and taxes incurred in providing that service. Washington Gas also sells natural gas to customers who have not elected to purchase natural gas from unregulated third party marketers (refer to the section entitled “Natural Gas Unbundling”). Washington Gas recovers the cost of the natural gas purchased to serve firm customers through recovery mechanisms as approved in jurisdictional tariffs. Any difference between gas costs incurred on behalf of firm customers and the gas costs recovered from those customers is deferred on the balance sheet as an amount to be collected from or refunded to

customers in future periods. Therefore, increases or decreases in the cost of gas associated with sales made to firm customers have no direct effect on Washington Gas’ net revenues and net income. However, to the extent Washington Gas does not have regulatory mechanisms in place to mitigate the indirect effects of higher gas prices, such as: (i) lower natural gas consumption caused by customer conservation; (ii) increased short-term interest expense to finance a higher natural gas storage and accounts receivables balances and (iii) higher expenses for uncollectible accounts, its net income may decrease. 
Washington Gas, under its asset optimization program, makes use of storage and transportation capacity resources when those assets are not required to serve utility customers. The objective of this program is to derive a profit to be shared with its utility customers. These profits are earned by entering into commodity-related physical and financial contracts with third parties (refer to the section entitled “Asset Optimization Derivative Contracts” for further discussion of the asset optimization program). Unless otherwise noted, therm deliveries reported for the regulated utility segment do not include deliveries related to the asset optimization program. 
At September 30, 2017, Washington Gas’ service area had a population estimated at 5.6 million and included approximately 2.2 million households and commercial structures. Washington Gas operations are such that the loss of any one customer or group of customers would not have a significant adverse effect on its business. The following table lists the number of active customer meters and therms delivered by jurisdiction as of and for the year ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

For additional information about gas deliveries and meter statistics, refer to the section entitled “Results of Operations” in Management’s Discussion for Washington Gas.
Hampshire Gas Company
Hampshire owns full and partial interests in underground natural gas storage facilities, including pipeline delivery facilities located in and around Hampshire County, West Virginia, and operates those facilities to serve Washington Gas, which purchases all of the storage services of Hampshire. Washington Gas includes the cost of these services in the bills sent to its customers. Hampshire operates under a “pass-through” cost of service-based tariff approved by the FERC, and adjusts its billing rates to Washington Gas on a periodic basis to account for changes in its investment in utility plant and associated expenses.
Regulatory Environment
Washington Gas is regulated by the PSC of DC, the PSC of MD and the SCC of VA which approve its terms of service and the billing rates that it charges to its customers. Hampshire is regulated by the FERC. The rates charged to utility customers are designed to recover Washington Gas’ operating expenses and natural gas commodity costs and to provide a return on its investment in the net assets used in its firm gas sales and delivery service. For a discussion of current rates and regulatory matters, refer to the section entitled “Rates and Regulatory Matters” in Management’s Discussion for Washington Gas.
District of Columbia Jurisdiction
The PSC of DC consists of three full-time members who are appointed by the Mayor with the advice and consent of the District of Columbia City Council. The term of each commissioner is four years with no limitations on the number of terms that can be served. The PSC of DC has no time limitation within which it must make decisions regarding modifications to base rates charged by Washington Gas to its customers; however, it targets resolving pending rate cases within three months of the close of record.

Item 1. Business (continued)

Maryland Jurisdiction
The PSC of MD consists of five full-time members who are appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate of Maryland. Each commissioner is appointed to a five-year term, with no limit on the number of terms that can be served.
When Washington Gas files for a rate increase, the PSC of MD may initially suspend the proposed increase for 180 days, and then has the option to extend the suspension for an additional 30 days. If action has not been taken after 210 days, the requested rates become effective subject to refund.
Virginia Jurisdiction
The SCC of VA consists of three full-time members who are elected by the General Assembly of Virginia. Each commissioner has a six-year term with no limitation on the number of terms that can be served.
Either of two methods may be used to request a modification of existing rates. Washington Gas may file an application for a general rate increase, in which it may propose new adjustments to the cost of service that are different from those previously approved for Washington Gas by the SCC of VA, as well as a revised return on equity. The proposed rates under this process may take effect 150 days after the filing, subject to refund pending the outcome of the SCC of VA’s action on the application.
Alternatively, an expedited rate case procedure allows proposed rate increases to be effective 30 days after the filing date, subject to refund. Under this procedure, Washington Gas may not propose new adjustments for issues not approved in its last general rate case, or request a change in its authorized return on common equity. Once filed, other parties may propose new adjustments or a change in the cost of capital from the level authorized in its last general rate case. The expedited rate case procedure may not be available if the SCC of VA decides that there has been a substantial change in circumstances since the last general rate case filed by Washington Gas.
Seasonality of Business Operations
Washington Gas’ business is weather-sensitive and seasonal because the majority of its business is derived from residential and small commercial customers who use natural gas for space heating. Excluding deliveries for electric generation, 73% of the total therms delivered in Washington Gas’ service area occurred during its first and second fiscal quarters for both fiscal years 2017 and 2016. Washington Gas’ earnings are typically generated during these two quarters, and Washington Gas typically incurs net losses in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. The seasonal nature of the business creates large variations in short-term cash requirements, primarily due to the season-to-season fluctuations in the level of customer accounts receivable, unbilled revenues and storage gas inventories. Washington Gas finances these seasonal requirements primarily through the sale of commercial paper and unsecured short-term bank loans. For information on our management of weather risk, refer to the section entitled “Weather Risk” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis. For information about management of cash requirements, refer to the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis. 
Non-Weather Related Changes in Natural Gas Consumption Patterns
Natural gas supply requirements for the utility are affected by changes in the natural gas consumption patterns of our customers that are driven by factors other than weather. Natural gas usage per customer may decline as customers change their consumption patterns for various reasons, including: (i) more volatile and higher natural gas prices; (ii) customer upgrades to more energy efficient appliances and building structures and (iii) a decline in the economy in the region in which we operate. 
For each jurisdiction in which Washington Gas operates, changes in customer usage profiles are reflected in rate case proceedings and rates are adjusted accordingly. Changes in customer usage by existing customers that occur subsequent to rate case proceedings in Maryland generally will not change revenues because the RNA mechanism stabilizes the level of delivery charge revenues received from customers.
In Virginia, decoupling rate mechanisms for residential, small commercial and industrial and group metered apartment customers permit Washington Gas to adjust revenues for non-weather related changes in customer usage. The WNA and the CRA are billing mechanisms that together eliminate the effects of both weather and other factors such as conservation.
In the District of Columbia, a decrease in customer usage that occurs subsequent to a rate case proceeding would have the effect of reducing revenues, which could be offset by additions of new customers.
Natural Gas Supply and Capacity
10

WGL Holdings, Inc.

Item 1. Business (continued)

Capacity and Supply Requirements
Washington Gas must contract for reliable and adequate natural gas supplies, interstate pipeline capacity and storage capacity to provide natural gas to its distribution system, while considering: (i) the dynamics of the commodity supply and interstate pipeline and storage capacity markets; (ii) its own on-system natural gas peaking facilities and (iii) the characteristics of its customer base. Energy-marketing companies that sell natural gas to customers located within Washington Gas’ service territory are responsible for acquiring natural gas for their customers; however, Washington Gas allocates certain storage and pipeline capacity related to these customers in accordance with regulatory requirements. 
Washington Gas has adopted a diversified portfolio approach designed to address constraints on supply by using multiple supply receipt points, dependable interstate pipeline transportation and storage arrangements, and its own substantial storage and peak shaving capabilities. Washington Gas’ supply and pipeline capacity plan is based on forecasted system requirements, and takes into account estimated load growth, attrition, conservation, geographic location, interstate pipeline and storage capacity and contractual limitations and the forecasted movement of customers between bundled service and delivery service. Under reduced supply conditions, Washington Gas may implement contingency plans in order to maximize the number of customers served. Contingency plans include requests to the general population to conserve and target curtailments to specific sections of the system, consistent with curtailment tariffs approved by regulators in each of Washington Gas’ three jurisdictions.

Washington Gas obtains natural gas supplies that originate from multiple regions throughout the United States. At September 30, 2017 and 2016, Washington Gas had service agreements with four pipeline companies that provided firm transportation and/or storage services directly to Washington Gas’ city gates. These contracts have expiration dates ranging from fiscal years 2018 to 2034. Additionally, Washington Gas has contracted with various interstate pipeline and storage companies to add to its storage and transportation capacity starting in fiscal year 2018 and continues to monitor other opportunities to acquire or participate in obtaining additional pipeline and storage capacity that will support customer growth and improve or maintain the high level of service expected by its customer base.
Asset Optimization Derivative Contracts
Under the asset optimization program, Washington Gas utilizes its storage and transportation capacity resources when they are not being used to serve its utility customers. Washington Gas executes commodity-related physical and financial contracts in the form of forwards, futures and options as part of an asset optimization program that is managed by its internal staff. These transactions are accounted for as derivatives. The objective of this program is to derive a profit to be shared with Washington Gas' utility customers. Washington Gas enters into these derivative transaction contracts to secure operating margins that will ultimately be shared between Washington Gas customers and shareholders. Because these sharing mechanisms are approved by our regulators in all three jurisdictions, any changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded through earnings or as regulatory assets or liabilities if realized gains and losses will be included in the rates charged to customers.
The derivatives used under this program are subject to fair value accounting treatment which may cause significant period-to-period volatility in earnings from unrealized gains and losses associated with changes in fair value for the portion of net profits attributed to shareholders. However, this earnings volatility does not change the realized margins that Washington Gas expects to earn from these transactions. All physically and financially settled contracts under our asset optimization program are reported on a net basis in the statements of income in “Utility cost of gas.” Total net margins including unrealized gains and losses recorded to “Utility cost of gas” after sharing and management fees associated with all asset optimization transactions for the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were net gains of $82.9 million, $43.8 million, and $27.9 million.
Refer to the sections entitled “Results of Operations — Regulated Utility Operating Results” and “Market Risk” in Management’s Discussion for further discussion of the asset optimization program and its effect on earnings.
Annual Sendout
As reflected in the table below, Washington Gas received natural gas from multiple sources in fiscal year 2017 and expects to use those same sources to satisfy customer demand in fiscal year 2018. Firm transportation denotes gas transported directly to the entry point of Washington Gas’ distribution system in contractual volumes. Transportation storage denotes volumes stored by a pipeline during the spring, summer and fall for withdrawal and delivery to the Washington Gas distribution system during the winter heating season to meet load requirements. Peak load requirements are met by: (i) underground natural gas storage at the Hampshire storage field; (ii) the local production of propane air plants located at Washington Gas-owned facilities in Rockville, Maryland (Rockville Station) and in Springfield, Virginia (Ravensworth Station) and (iii) other peak-

shaving resources. Unregulated third party marketers acquire interstate pipeline and storage capacity and the natural gas commodity on behalf of Washington Gas’ delivery service customers under customer choice programs. Washington Gas also provides transportation, storage and peaking resources to unregulated third party marketers (refer to the section entitled “Natural Gas Unbundling”). These retail marketers have natural gas delivered to the entry point of Washington Gas’ distribution system on behalf of those utility customers that have decided to acquire their natural gas commodity on an unbundled basis, as discussed below. 

Excluding the sendout of sales and deliveries of natural gas used for electric generation, the following table outlines total sendout of the system. The sources of delivery and related volumes that were used to satisfy the requirements of fiscal year 2017 and those projected for pipeline year 2018 are shown in the following table.

(a)Based on normal weather.
Design Day Sendout
The effectiveness of Washington Gas’ capacity resource plan is largely dependent on the sources used to satisfy forecasted and actual customer demand requirements for its design day. For planning purposes, Washington Gas assumes that all interruptible customers will be curtailed on the design day. Washington Gas’ forecasted design day demand for the 2017-2018 winter season is 19.8 million therms and Washington Gas’ projected sources of delivery for design day sendout is 21.0 million therms. This provides a reserve margin of approximately 5.9%. Washington Gas plans for the optimal utilization of its storage and peaking capacity to reduce its dependency on firm transportation and to lower pipeline capacity costs. The following table reflects the sources of delivery that are projected to be used to satisfy the forecasted design day sendout estimate for fiscal year 2018.

Projected Sources of Delivery for Design Day Sendout 
(In millions of therms) | Fiscal Year 2017
Sources of Delivery | Volumes | Percent

Unregulated Third Party Marketers | 0.2 | | 1 | %
Total | 21.0 | | 100 | %

Natural Gas Unbundling
At September 30, 2017, customer choice programs for natural gas customers were available to all of Washington Gas’ regulated utility customers in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia. These programs allow customers to purchase their natural gas from unregulated third party marketers, rather than purchasing this commodity as part of a bundled service from the local utility. Of Washington Gas’ 1.2 million active customers at September 30, 2017, approximately 178,000 customers purchased their natural gas commodity from unregulated third party marketers.

The following table provides the percentage of customers participating in customer choice programs in Washington Gas’ jurisdictions at September 30, 2017.

When customers choose to purchase the natural gas commodity from unregulated third party marketers, Washington Gas’ net income is not affected because Washington Gas charges its customers the cost of gas without any mark-up. When customers select an unregulated third party marketer as their gas supplier, Washington Gas continues to charge these customers to deliver natural gas through its distribution system at rates identical to the delivery portion of the bundled sales service customers.
Safety and Reliability of the Natural Gas Distribution System
Maintaining and improving the public safety and reliability of Washington Gas’ distribution system is our highest priority, providing benefits to both customers and investors through improved customer service. Washington Gas continually monitors and reviews changes in requirements of the codes and regulations that govern the operation of the distribution system and refines its safety practices, with a particular focus on design, construction, maintenance, operation, replacement, inspection and monitoring practices to meet or exceed these requirements. Significant changes in regulations can impact the cost of operating and maintaining our distribution system. 
Competition
The Natural Gas Delivery Function
The natural gas delivery function, the core business of Washington Gas, continues to be regulated by local and state regulatory commissions. In developing this core business, Washington Gas has invested $5.3 billion as of September 30, 2017, in safe and reliable distribution system assets. Because of the high fixed costs and significant safety and environmental considerations associated with building and operating a distribution system, Washington Gas expects to continue being the only owner and operator of a distribution system in its current franchise area for the foreseeable future. The nature of Washington Gas’ customer base and the distance of most customers from interstate pipelines mitigate the threat of bypass of its facilities by other potential delivery service providers.
Competition with Other Energy Products
Washington Gas faces competition based on customers’ preference for other energy products and the prices of those products compared to natural gas. In the residential market, which generates a significant portion of Washington Gas’ net income, the most significant product competition occurs between natural gas and electricity. Because the cost of electricity is affected by the cost of fuel used to generate electricity, such as natural gas, Washington Gas generally maintains a price advantage over competitive electricity supply in its service area for traditional residential uses of energy such as heating, water heating and cooking. Washington Gas continues to attract the majority of the new residential construction market in its service territory, and consumers’ continuing preference for natural gas allows Washington Gas to maintain a strong market presence. The following table lists the new customer meters added by jurisdiction and major rate class for the year ended September 30, 2017.

In the interruptible market, fuel oil is the prevalent energy alternative to natural gas. Washington Gas’ success in this market depends largely on the relationship between natural gas and oil prices. The supply of natural gas primarily is derived from domestic sources, and the relationship between supply and demand generally has the greatest impact on natural gas prices. Since the source of a large portion of oil comes from foreign countries, political events and foreign currency conversion rates can influence oil supplies and prices to domestic consumers.
Critical Factors
Factors critical to the success of the regulated utility segment include: (i) operating a safe and reliable natural gas distribution system; (ii) having sufficient natural gas supplies to meet customer demands; (iii) being competitive with other sources of energy such as electricity, fuel oil and propane; (iv) having access to sources of liquidity; (v) recovering the costs and expenses of this business in the rates charged to customers and (vi) earning a just and reasonable rate of return on invested capital.
RETAIL ENERGY-MARKETING SEGMENT
The retail energy-marketing segment consists of the operations of WGL Energy Services, which competes with regulated utilities and other unregulated third party marketers to sell natural gas and/or electricity directly to residential, commercial and industrial customers in Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. WGL Energy Services is subject to regulation by the public service regulatory commissions of the states in which the company is authorized as a competitive service provider. These regulatory commissions: (i) authorize WGL Energy Services to provide service, (ii) review certain terms and conditions of service, (iii) establish the regulatory rules for interactions between the utility and the competitive service provider and (iv) issue orders and promulgate rules that establish the broad structure and conduct of retail energy markets. Changes to the rules, rates and orders by the regulatory commissions may affect WGL Energy Services’ financial performance. 
WGL Energy Services buys natural gas and electricity with the objective of earning a profit through competitively priced sales contracts with end-users. These commodities are delivered to retail customers through the distribution systems owned by regulated utilities. Washington Gas is one of several utilities that deliver gas to, and on behalf of, WGL Energy Services. Unaffiliated electric utilities deliver all of the electricity sold by WGL Energy Services. Additionally, WGL Energy Services bills its customers either independently or through the billing services of the regulated utilities that deliver its commodities. Refer to Note 18—Related Party Transactions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our purchase of receivables program. 
WGL Energy Services also sells wind and other RECs and carbon offsets to retail customers. WGL Energy Services owns solar generating assets which are dedicated to five specific customers. The results of operations for these assets are reported within the Commercial Energy Systems segment. WGL Energy Services does not own or operate any other electric generation, transmission or distribution assets.
At September 30, 2017, WGL Energy Services served approximately 116,200 residential, commercial and industrial natural gas customer accounts and approximately 113,700 residential, commercial and industrial electricity customer accounts located in Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. Its customer concentration is such that the loss of any one customer or group of customers would not have a significant adverse effect on its business.
The retail energy-marketing segment’s total operating revenues were $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2017, $1.2 billion for fiscal year 2016, and $1.3 billion for fiscal year 2015.

Seasonality of Business Operations
The operations of WGL Energy Services are seasonal, with larger amounts of electricity being sold in the summer and peak winter months and larger amounts of natural gas being sold in the winter months. Working capital requirements can vary significantly during the year and these variations are financed through internally generated funds and WGL’s issuance of commercial paper and unsecured short-term bank loans. WGL Energy Services accesses these funds through the WGL money pool. For a discussion of the WGL money pool, refer to the section entitled “Money Pool” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis. 
Natural Gas and Electricity Supply
WGL Energy Services contracts for storage and pipeline capacity to meet its customers’ needs primarily through transportation releases and storage services allocated from the utility companies in the various service territories in which it provides retail energy commodity. 
On February 20, 2013, WGL Energy Services entered into a five-year secured supply arrangement with Shell Energy North America (US), LP (Shell Energy). Under this arrangement, WGL Energy Services has the ability to purchase the majority of its power, natural gas and related products from Shell Energy in a structure that reduces WGL Energy Services’ cash flow risk from collateral posting requirements. While Shell is intended to be the majority provider of natural gas and electricity, WGL Energy Services retains the right to purchase supply from other providers. On November 7, 2016, the supply arrangement was extended for two years, expiring in 2020.
Natural gas supplies are delivered to WGL Energy Services’ market territories through several interstate natural gas pipelines. To supplement WGL Energy Services’ natural gas supplies during periods of high customer demand, WGL Energy Services maintains gas storage inventory in storage facilities that are assigned by natural gas utilities such as Washington Gas. This storage inventory enables WGL Energy Services to meet daily and monthly fluctuations in demand and to minimize the effect of market price volatility.
 The PJM Interconnection (PJM) is a regional transmission organization that regulates and coordinates generation supply and the wholesale delivery of electricity in the states and jurisdictions where WGL Energy Services operates. WGL Energy Services buys wholesale and sells retail electricity in the PJM market territory, subject to its rules and regulations. PJM requires that its market participants have sufficient load capacity to serve their customers’ load requirements.
Competition
Natural Gas. WGL Energy Services competes with regulated gas utilities and other third party marketers to sell natural gas to customers both inside and outside of the Washington Gas service area. 
Electricity. WGL Energy Services competes with regulated electric utilities and other third party marketers to sell electricity to customers. 
Marketers of natural gas and electric supply compete largely on price; therefore, gross margins are relatively small. To provide competitive pricing to its retail customers and in adherence to its risk management policies and procedures, WGL Energy Services manages its natural gas and electricity contract portfolios by attempting to closely match the commitments for gas and electricity deliveries from suppliers with requirements to serve sales customers. 
WGL Energy Services’ residential and small commercial electric customer growth opportunities are significantly affected by the price for Standard Offer Service (SOS) offered by electric utilities. These rates are periodically reset for each customer class based on the regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction. Customer growth opportunities either expand or contract due to the relationship of these SOS rates to current market prices.
For a discussion of WGL Energy Services’ exposure to and management of price risk, refer to the section entitled “Market Risk—Price Risk Related to the Non-Utility Segments” in Management’s Discussion. 
Critical Factors
Factors critical to managing the retail energy-marketing segment include: (i) managing the market risk of the difference between the price committed to customers under sales contracts and the cost of natural gas and electricity needed to satisfy

these commitments, including PJM costs and costs to meet renewable portfolio standards; (ii) managing credit risks associated with customers and suppliers; (iii) having sufficient deliverability of natural gas and electric supplies and transportation to serve the demand of its customers, which can be affected by the ability of natural gas producers, pipeline gatherers, natural gas processors, interstate pipelines, electricity generators and regional electric transmission operators to deliver the respective commodities; (iv) access to sources of financial liquidity; (v) controlling the level of selling, general and administrative expenses, including customer acquisition expenses and (iv) access to markets through customer choice programs or other forms of deregulation.
COMMERCIAL ENERGY SYSTEMS SEGMENT
The commercial energy systems segment consists of the operations of WGL Energy Systems, WGSW and the results of operations of wholly owned subsidiaries, consolidated investments and affiliate owned commercial distributed energy projects. 
This segment focuses on clean and energy efficient solutions for its customers, driving earnings through (i) investing in distributed generation assets such as Solar PV systems, combined heat and power plants, and natural gas fuel cells and (ii) operating as a general contractor to upgrade the mechanical, electrical, water and energy-related infrastructure of large governmental and commercial facilities by implementing both traditional and alternative energy technologies. This segment has assets and activities across the United States.

As of September 30, 2017, this segment owned $561.0 million of operating distributed generation assets, generating a total of 290,465 megawatt hours in fiscal year 2017. Additionally, as of September 30, 2017, there was $41.0 million of signed projects under construction. These distributed generation assets drive revenue through the sale of renewable power generation under long-term power purchase agreements and the sale of renewable energy credits. As of September 30, 2017, we have $150.9 million in unamortized investment tax credits and grants related to these assets placed in service. These credits and grants are recognized as reductions in tax expense by amortizing them over the useful life of the underlying assets, typically 30 years. 
Competition
There are many competitors in this business segment. In the renewable energy and distributed generation market, competitors primarily include other developers, tax equity investors, distributed generation asset owner firms and lending institutions. Within the government sector, competitors primarily include companies contracting with customers under Energy Savings Performance Contracting (ESPC) as well as utilities providing services under Utility Energy Saving Contracts (UESC). WGL Energy Systems competes on the basis of strong customer relationships developed over many years of implementing successful projects, developing and maintaining strong supplier relationships, and focusing in areas where it can bring relevant expertise.
Critical Factors
Factors critical to the success of the commercial energy systems segment include: (i) generating adequate sales commitments from distributed generation channel partners and customers; (ii) generating adequate sales commitments from the government and private sectors in the facility construction and retrofit markets; (iii) building a stable base of customer relationships; (iv) estimating and managing fixed-price contracts with contractors; (v) managing selling, general and administrative expenses; (vi) managing price and operational risk associated with distributed energy projects and (vii) successful operation and optimization of commercial assets. 
MIDSTREAM ENERGY SERVICES SEGMENT
WGL Midstream specializes in the investment, management, development and optimization of natural gas storage and transportation assets. At September 30, 2017, WGL Midstream had infrastructure investments totaling $384.6 million. For a discussion of WGL Midstream's infrastructure investments, refer to the section entitled "Liquidity and Capital Resources--Infrastructure Investments" in Management's Discussion.
Additionally, WGL Midstream provides natural gas related solutions to its customers and counterparties including producers, utilities, local distribution companies, power generators, wholesale energy suppliers, LNG exporters, pipelines and storage facilities. Moreover, WGL Midstream contracts for storage and pipeline capacity in its trading activities through both long term contracts and short term transportation releases. WGL Midstream also contracts for physical natural gas sales and purchases on both a long term and short term basis.

Item 1. Business (continued)

WGL Midstream enters into both physical and financial derivative transactions to mitigate risks while seeking to maximize potential profits from the optimization of the transportation and storage assets it has under contract. These derivatives may cause significant period-to-period volatility in earnings as recorded under GAAP; however, this earnings volatility will not change the realized margins that WGL Midstream expects to earn on the underlying physical transactions.
WGL Midstream seeks to manage price risk exposure under its risk management policy by matching its forward physical and financial positions with its asset base. For a discussion of WGL Midstream’s exposure to and management of price risk, refer to the section entitled “Market Risk-Price Risk Related to the Non-Utility Segments” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
Competition 
WGL Midstream competes with other midstream infrastructure and energy services companies, wholesale energy suppliers, producers and other non-utility affiliates of regulated utilities for the acquisition of natural gas storage and transportation assets.
Price Volatility
WGL Midstream can be positively or negatively affected by significant volatility in the wholesale price of natural gas. WGL Midstream risk management policies and procedures are designed to minimize the risk that purchase commitments and the related sale commitments do not closely match. In general, profit opportunities for trading activities are increased for WGL Midstream with increased volatility in natural gas prices. These opportunities are primarily in short term transportation and storage spreads, seasonal storage spreads and long term supply or basis transactions. 
Critical Factors
Factors critical to the success of WGL Midstream’s operations include: (i) pipeline investment projects are on time and on budget within set parameters; (ii) internal risk management policies; (iii) winning business in a competitive marketplace; (iv) managing counterparty credit risk; (v) managing contract risks associated with the purchase and sale of natural gas, including index pricing and changes in natural gas markets; (vi) maintaining and leveraging expertise in managing and optimizing natural gas related contracts; (vii) access to sources of financial liquidity and (viii) the level of general and administrative expenses.
OTHER ACTIVITIES
Activities and transactions that are not significant enough on a stand-alone basis to warrant treatment as an operating segment, and that do not fit into one of our other operating segments, are aggregated as “Other activities” in the Operating Segment Financial Information. Administrative and business development activity costs associated with WGL and Washington Gas Resources are included in this segment. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations related to environmental matters. These laws and regulations may require expenditures over a long timeframe to control environmental effects. Almost all of the environmental liabilities we have recorded are for costs expected to be incurred to remediate sites where we or a predecessor affiliate operated manufactured gas plants (MGPs). Estimates of liabilities for environmental response costs are difficult to determine with precision because of the various factors that can affect their ultimate level. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | the complexity of the site;


• | changes in environmental laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels;


• | the number of regulatory agencies or other parties involved;


• | new technology that renders previous technology obsolete or experience with existing technology that proves ineffective;


• | the level of remediation required and


• | variation between the estimated and actual period of time required to respond to an environmentally-contaminated site.

Item 1. Business (concluded)

Washington Gas has identified up to ten sites where it or its predecessors may have operated MGPs. Washington Gas’ last use of an MGP was in 1984. In connection with these operations, we are aware that coal tar and certain other by-products of the gas manufacturing process are present at or near some former sites, and may be present at others. Based on the information available to us, we have concluded that none of the sites are likely to present an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment, and either the appropriate remediation is being undertaken, or Washington Gas believes no remediation is necessary. 
Washington Gas is currently conducting a remedial investigation and feasibility study of potential contamination in the Anacostia River associated with and adjacent to one of its former MGP sites under a 2012 consent decree with the District of Columbia and federal governments. During the fiscal year ended 2017, Washington Gas began working on the second phase of this study, an in-river investigation designed to evaluate the nature and extent of contamination in groundwater (beneath the river), surface water, and sediments of the Anacostia River. The study is ongoing. 
Washington Gas received a letter in February 2016 from the District of Columbia and National Park Service regarding the Anacostia River Sediment Project, indicating that the District of Columbia is conducting a separate remedial investigation and feasibility study of the river to determine if and what cleanup measures may be required and to prepare a natural resource damage assessment. The sediment project draft report identifies one of Washington Gas’ former MGP sites as one of seventeen potential environmental cleanup sites. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, Washington Gas received a request for information related to three Washington Gas properties: the previously identified former MGP site under the 2012 consent decree, one other former MGP site and another Washington Gas location. We are not able to estimate the amount of potential damages or timing associated with the District of Columbia's environmental investigation on the Anacostia River at this time. While an allocation method has not been established, Washington Gas has accrued an amount based on a potential range of estimates.
The impact of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on Washington Gas’ financial position, cash flows, capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. See Note 12—Environmental Matters of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of environmental response costs.
