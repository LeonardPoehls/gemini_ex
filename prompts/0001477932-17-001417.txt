Amounts for the Company’s historical (pre-reverse stock split) common stock including share and earnings per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted using the respective ratio of 1-for-2500 in this filing, unless otherwise disclosed and indicated.
Organizational History
 
Precision Aerospace Components (“Precision Aerospace”, “Precision” or the “Company”) was previously known as Jordan 1 Holdings Company (“Jordan 1”) and was incorporated in Delaware on December 28, 2005. Jordan 1 is the successor to Gasel Transportation Lines, Inc. ("Gasel"), a corporation that was organized under the laws of the State of Ohio on January 27, 1988.
 
Gasel was a trucking company that filed for bankruptcy in the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, in May 2003. On December 12, 2005, a final plan of reorganization was approved by the court and the bankruptcy proceeding was dismissed.
 
Subsequent to December 30, 2005, Jordan 1 did not engage in any business activity until July 20, 2006 when it entered into an exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the equity of Delaware Fastener Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“DFAC”), pursuant to an exchange agreement with the stockholders of DFAC. Contemporaneously, DFAC acquired the assets, subject to certain liabilities, of Freundlich Supply Company, Inc. (“Freundlich Supply”) pursuant to an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) dated May 24, 2006 among DFAC, Freundlich Supply, and Michael Freundlich. The purchase of the assets was financed by the proceeds from the sale by the Company of its securities pursuant to a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”). As a result of the Exchange Agreement, DFAC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Upon completion of the foregoing transactions, the Company changed its name to Precision Aerospace Components, Inc. and DFAC changed its name to Freundlich Supply Company, Inc. (“Freundlich”). On March 13, 2009, Precision formed Tiger-Tight Corp., a Delaware corporation, as a wholly-owned subsidiary to serve as the exclusive North American master distributor of the Tiger-Tight locking washer.
 
On March 25, 2012, Precision formed two-wholly owned subsidiaries, Apace Acquisition I, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Apace Acquisition II, Inc., a Delaware corporation. On May 25, 2012, the Company acquired the assets and certain of the liabilities of Fastener Distribution and Marketing Company, Inc., which was comprised of two fastener distribution companies, Aero-Missile Components, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation and Creative Assembly Systems, Inc., an Ohio corporation. Apace Acquisition I, Inc. acquired all of the assets of Aero-Missile Components, Inc. and subsequently changed its name to Aero-Missile Components, Inc. Apace Acquisition II, Inc. acquired all of the assets of Creative Assembly Systems, Inc. and subsequently changed its name to Creative Assembly Systems, Inc.

Overview of Business
 
The Company distributes high-quality, predominantly domestically-manufactured, technically complex, nut and bolt products and a proprietary locking washer product that are used primarily for aerospace and military applications and for industrial/commercial applications that require a high level of certified and assured quality.
 
The Company's operations are carried out through its wholly-owned distribution subsidiaries, Aero-Missile and Creative Assembly. Aero-Missile has a stocking distributor relationship with a number of United States fastener manufacturers and sells high technology, specially engineered fasteners - nuts and bolts - predominantly to all levels of the aviation industries (original equipment manufacturers, maintenance and repair organizations, and other distributors as well as to the United States Department of Defense (“Department of Defense”). Creative Assembly is a value added distributor of proprietary and specialty fasteners primarily serving the heavy truck, automotive, transportation, and infrastructure industries.
 
The Company’s products are manufactured, by others, to exacting specifications and are made from materials that provide the strength and reliability required for their aerospace and industrial applications.
 
Industry Overview
 
The fastener distribution industry is highly fragmented. No one company holds a dominant position. This is primarily caused by the varied uses of fasteners and the size of the industry. Precision competes with the numerous fastener distributors which serve as authorized stocking distributors for one or more of the manufacturers in the Company’s supplier base. Precision believes that the depth of its inventory represents a competitive advantage. As a stocking distributor, the Company has employed a business model of maintaining levels of inventory on hand or on order with its suppliers that can satisfy its customers’ projected needs. The demanding quality, inspection, tracking and re-inspection requirements, part certifications and customer qualifications imposed on distributors of aviation fasteners by major consumers create a barrier to entry. 
Customers
 
In the years 2016 and 2015, approximately19.4% and 17.9% of the Company’s sales were to the Department of Defense, respectively. The balance due from this customer represents 16% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2016 and 8.4% at December 31, 2015. All of these products were sold for maintenance, repair and operations functions. Precision shipped to various government installations across the United States.
 
In each of the years 2016 and 2015, approximately 20.1% of the Company’s sales were to PACCAR, Inc. The balance due from this customer represents 15% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2016 and 14.4% at December 31, 2015. All of these products were sold for manufacturing, repairs, and maintenance of trucks.
 
No other customers represented more than 10 percent of total sales in 2016 or 2015, or outstanding accounts receivable as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Competition
 
The fastener distribution industry as a whole is highly competitive and fragmented. In addition to competing against other distributors, the company believes it faces competition from end users creating their own supply chain management.
 
The company believes its competitive attributes are as follows:
 


· | The Company’s quality system is certified to Rev. C, AS9120:2009 and ISO 9001:2008 quality measures. Since quality is an important measure of aerospace suppliers, the Company strives to maintain its quality system to the highest standards in the industry. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | As an authorized stocking distributor for the premier domestic manufacturers, the Company is able to maintain relationships with customers not generally available to the industry. Many manufacturers in the past several years have consolidated their network of authorized distributors.
· | As a certified government supplier, also known as “Qualified Supplier/List Distributor,” (“QSLD”) the Company faces less competition when quoting certain orders. 

Government Regulation
 
The Fastener Quality Act (“FQA”) and its implementing regulations issued by the United States Department of Commerce require certain distributors of fasteners to, among other things, maintain lot traceability for all of their products sold. This requires that companies like Precision keep their books and records for aerospace parts such that they can trace the origin of each item sold back to the manufacturer from which the item was purchased. The FQA imposes additional requirements on the manufacturers of the subject parts and on the users. Because of the demands of the industry, its customers, and its own quality systems, the Company maintains strict lot traceability for each item in its aerospace inventory, and has done so for many years.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had 24 employees, of whom 1 was part-time. We believe our employee relations are very good.
