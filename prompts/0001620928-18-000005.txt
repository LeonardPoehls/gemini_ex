 Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a growth-oriented limited partnership formed by Rice Energy to own, operate, develop and acquire midstream assets in the Appalachian Basin. We operate in two business segments, which are managed separately due to their distinct operational differences: (i) gathering and compression and (ii) water services. Our natural gas gathering assets consist of natural gas gathering systems and associated compression that service EQT and other third-party producers in the dry gas core of the Marcellus Shale in southwestern Pennsylvania. Our water services assets consist of water pipelines, impoundment facilities, pumping stations, take point facilities and measurement facilities, which are used to support well completion activities and to collect and recycle or dispose of flowback and produced water for EQT and other third-party producers in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania and Belmont County, Ohio. We provide our services under long-term, fee-based contracts, primarily to EQT and its affiliates. Our principal business objective is to increase the quarterly cash distributions that we pay to our unitholders over time while ensuring the ongoing stability of our business.
On November 13, 2017 (the Merger Date), EQT and Rice Energy consummated the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 19, 2017 (as amended, the Merger Agreement), by and among EQT, Rice Energy and a wholly-owned subsidiary of EQT (Merger Sub). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Rice Energy, with Rice Energy continuing as the surviving entity and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of EQT. Immediately thereafter Rice Energy merged with and into another indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of EQT (together, the Mergers). 
Prior to the completion of the Mergers, Rice Energy was the indirect parent of our general partner and an indirect limited partner of us. Immediately following the completion of the Mergers, EQT became the indirect parent of our general partner and an indirect limited partner of us, acquiring beneficial ownership of 3,623 common units representing limited partner interests, 28,753,623 subordinated units representing limited partner interests and all of our incentive distribution rights (IDRs), which entitle EQT to receive 50% of all incremental cash distributed in a quarter after $0.2813 has been distributed in respect of each common unit of RMP for that quarter. The subordinated units converted into common units on a one-for-one basis on February 15, 2018.
Our Assets 
Gathering and Compression Segment
Our gathering and compression assets are concentrated in the dry gas core of the Marcellus Shale and, as of December 31, 2017, consisted of a high-pressure dry gas gathering system and associated compression in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, with connections to the Dominion Transmission, Columbia Gas Transmission, Texas Eastern Transmission, Equitrans Transmission and National Fuel Gas Supply interstate pipelines. The dry gas core of the Marcellus Shale in southwestern Pennsylvania is characterized by a combination of low development costs, consistently high production volumes and access to multiple takeaway pipelines. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, our average daily throughput was 1,539 BBtu/d. As of December 31, 2017, our gathering assets consisted of 178 miles of pipeline with gathering capacity of 5.1 TBtu/d and compression capacity of approximately 85,000 horsepower. 
We contract with EQT and other producers to gather and compress natural gas from wells and well pads located in our dedicated areas and/or near our gathering systems. The natural gas we gather and compress generally requires no processing or treating prior to delivery into interstate pipelines.
We generate all of our gathering and compression revenues pursuant to long-term, fixed price per unit contracts. We generate revenue primarily by charging a fixed price per unit for volumes of natural gas that we gather and compress through our systems. Our assets are sized to accommodate the projected future production growth of EQT, as well as to allow us to pursue volumes from additional third parties. We have secured dedications from certain EQT affiliates under various fixed price per unit gathering and compression agreements covering (i) approximately 246,000 gross acres of EQT’s acreage position as of December 31, 2017 in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, and (ii) subject to certain exceptions and limitations pursuant to the gathering and compression agreements, any future acreage certain affiliates of EQT acquire within these counties.
Following the completion of the Mergers, EQT became our largest customer, representing substantially all of our gathering and compression volumes for the year ended December 31, 2017 when considering the combined volumes of EQT and Rice Energy. 
Water Services Segment
6

Our water services assets consist of water pipelines, impoundment facilities, pumping stations, take point facilities and measurement facilities, which are used to support well completion activities and to collect and recycle or dispose of flowback and produced water for EQT and other third parties in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, and Belmont County, Ohio. We have the exclusive right to provide certain fluid handling services to EQT until December 22, 2029, and from month to month thereafter. The fluid handling services include the exclusive right to provide fresh water for well completions operations and to collect and recycle or dispose of flowback and produced water for EQT within certain areas of dedication in defined service areas in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania and Belmont County, Ohio. We also provide water services to third parties under fee-based contracts to support well completion activities. As of December 31, 2017, our Pennsylvania assets provided access to 29.4 MMgal/d of fresh water from the Monongahela River and several other regional water sources, while our Ohio assets provided access to 14.0 MMgal/d of fresh water from the Ohio River and several other regional water sources, both for distribution to EQT and third parties. 
Following the completion of the Mergers, EQT became our largest customer, representing approximately 91% of our water services volumes for the year ended December 31, 2017 when considering the combined volumes of EQT and Rice Energy. 
Please see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information about our segments. 
2018 Capital Budget
In 2018, we plan to invest $260 million on organic projects, of which $215 million is expected to be used for our continued build-out of our Pennsylvania gas gathering systems and $45 million is expected to be used for our water services infrastructure.
Our Customers
EQT (inclusive of the results of Rice Energy prior to the Mergers) represented substantially all of our gathering and compression revenues and 96% of our water revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Our Relationship with EQT
EQT is an integrated energy company, with an emphasis on natural gas production, gathering and transmission. EQT conducts its business through five business segments: EQT Production, EQM Gathering, EQM Transmission, RMP Gathering and RMP Water. EQT Production holds 21.4 Tcfe of proved natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves across approximately 4.0 million gross acres, including approximately 1.1 million gross acres in the Marcellus play, many of which have associated deep Utica and/or Upper Devonian drilling rights, and approximately 0.1 million gross acres in the Ohio Utica play as of December 31, 2017. EQM Gathering and EQM Transmission provide gathering, transmission and storage services for EQT's produced gas, as well as for independent third parties across the Appalachian Basin through EQT Midstream Partners, LP (EQM). 
Following the completion of the Mergers, EQT became the indirect parent of our general partner, which owned the non-economic general partner interest in us, and acquired beneficial ownership of a 28.1% limited partner interest in us and all of our IDRs. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, EQT indirectly held a 90.1% limited partner interest and 100% of the non-economic general partner interest in EQT GP Holdings, LP (EQGP), which owned a 1.8% general partner interest in EQM, all of the IDRs in EQM and a 26.6% limited partner interest in EQM. 
Our relationship with EQT is also a source of potential conflicts. For example, EQT is not restricted from competing with us, whether directly, through EQM or otherwise. In addition, all of the executive officers and six of the directors of our general partner also serve as officers and/or directors of EQT, three of the executive officers and four of the directors of our general partner also serve as officers and/or directors of EQT GP Services, LLC, the general partner of EQGP, and all of the executive officers and five of the directors of our general partner also serve as officers and/or directors of EQT Midstream Services, LLC, the general partner of EQM. These individuals face conflicts of interest, which include the allocation of their time among us, EQT, EQGP and EQM. For a description of our relationships with EQT, please read “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence.” In addition, EQT has announced that its board of directors has formed a committee to evaluate options for addressing EQT’s sum-of-the-parts discount. EQT’s board will announce a decision by the end of March 2018, after considering the committee’s recommendation.

Title to Properties and Rights-of-Way
Our real property is classified into two categories: (i) parcels that we own in fee and (ii) parcels in which our interest derives from leases, easements, right-of-ways, permits or licenses from landowners or government authorities, permitting the use of such land for our operations. Portions of the land on which our pipelines and major facilities are located are owned by us in fee title, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to these lands. The remainder of the land on which our pipelines and major facilities are located are held by us pursuant to surface leases between us, as lessee, and the fee owner of the lands, as lessors. We have leased or owned these lands without any material challenge known to us relating to the title to the land upon which the assets are located, and we believe that we have satisfactory leasehold estates or fee ownership of such lands. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license held by us or to our title to any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or lease, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of its material leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses. 

Some of the leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses that were transferred to us from Rice Energy required the consent of the grantor of such rights, which in certain instances is a governmental entity. Rice Energy obtained sufficient third-party consents, permits and authorizations for the transfer of the assets necessary to enable us to operate our business in all material respects. With respect to any remaining consents, permits or authorizations that have not been obtained, we have determined these will not have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business should we fail to obtain such consents, permits or authorization in a reasonable time frame. 
Seasonality
Demand for natural gas generally decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the summer and winter months. However, seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or mild summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. These seasonal anomalies can increase demand for our services during the summer and winter months and decrease demand for our services during the spring and fall months. 
Competition 
Key competitors for new gathering systems include companies that own major natural gas pipelines, independent gas gatherers and integrated energy companies. Many of our competitors, including EQM, have capital resources and control supplies of natural gas greater than we do. Key competition for water services include natural gas producers that develop their own water distribution systems in lieu of employing our assets and other natural gas midstream companies. Our ability to attract volumes to the water services business depends on our ability to evaluate and select suitable projects and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.
Regulation of Operations
Regulation of pipeline gathering services may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our services. Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government, primarily the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affects the marketing of natural gas that EQT produces, as well as the revenues EQT receives for sales of its natural gas.
The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated primarily under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) and by regulations and orders promulgated under the NGA by FERC. In certain limited circumstances, intrastate transportation, gathering, and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by Congress and by FERC regulations.
Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although its policy is still in flux, FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase EQT’s costs of getting gas to point of sale locations. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally include various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory-take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, states are currently pursuing regulatory programs intended to safely build pipeline infrastructure. For instance, the Pennsylvania Pipeline Infrastructure Task Force is currently developing policies and guidelines to assist in pipeline development to, among other goals, ensure pipeline safety and integrity during operation of the pipeline.
Intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as our assets are determined to be intrastate transportation 
8

facilities, such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, and we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis would not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that EQT produces, as well as the revenues EQT receives for sales of its natural gas.
Changes in law and to FERC policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action FERC will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas gatherers with which we compete.
FERC is authorized to impose civil penalties of up to approximately $1.2 million per violation, per day for violations of the NGA, the Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA) or the rules, regulations, restrictions, conditions and orders promulgated under those statutes. This maximum penalty authority established by statute will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the transportation and sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. 
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005) amended the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior as prescribed by FERC. In Order No. 670, the FERC promulgated rules implementing the anti-market manipulation provision of EPAct 2005. The rules make it unlawful in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, (1) to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The anti-market manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction.
Gathering Pipeline Regulation 
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests the FERC has used to establish whether a pipeline is a gathering pipeline not subject to FERC jurisdiction as a natural gas company. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is often the subject of litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts, or Congress. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the FERC. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or the NGPA, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the cost-based rate established by the FERC.
 While our systems have not been regulated by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA, we are required to report aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. In addition, Congress may enact legislation or FERC may adopt regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to further regulation. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability.
State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities and intrastate transportation pipelines generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. Our natural gas gathering facilities are not subject to rate regulation or open access requirements in the states in which we operate. However, state regulators may require us to register as pipeline operators, pay assessment and registration fees, undergo inspections, and report annually on the miles of pipeline we operate. We cannot predict what new or different regulations federal and state regulatory agencies may adopt, or what effect subsequent regulation may have on our activities. Such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, result of operations and cash flows.
Pipeline Safety Regulation
9

Some of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (NGPSA), and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (PSIA), as reauthorized and amended by the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 (2006 PIPES Act). The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities, while the PSIA establishes mandatory inspections for all U.S. oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in high-consequence areas (HCAs).
The PHMSA has developed regulations that require pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs. The regulations require operators, including us, to:

• | perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;


• | identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact an HCA;


• | improve data collection, integration and analysis;


• | repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and


• | implement preventive and mitigating actions.

The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (2011 Pipeline Safety Act) reauthorizes funding for federal pipeline safety programs, increases penalties for safety violations, establishes additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines, and requires studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, among other things, increases the maximum civil penalty for pipeline safety violations and directs the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate rules or standards relating to expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, excess flow valve use, leak detection system installation and testing to confirm the material strength of pipe operating above 30% of specified minimum yield strength in HCAs. PHMSA has the authority to impose civil penalties for pipeline safety violations up to a maximum of approximately $200,000 per day for each violation and approximately $2 million for a related series of violations. This maximum penalty authority established by statute will continue to be adjusted periodically to account for inflation. The safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act as well as any implementation of PHMSA regulations thereunder or any issuance or reinterpretation of PHMSA guidance with respect thereto could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any of which could result in our incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.
PHMSA regularly revises its pipeline safety regulations. For example, in March of 2015, PHMSA finalized new rules applicable to gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that, among other changes, impose new post-construction inspections, welding, gas component pressure testing requirements, as well as requirements for calculating pressure reductions for immediate repairs on liquid pipelines. Additionally, in April 2016, PHMSA proposed rules that would, if adopted, impose more stringent requirements for certain gas lines. Among other things, the proposed rulemaking would extend certain of PHMSA’s current regulatory safety programs for gas pipelines beyond HCAs to cover gas pipelines found in newly defined “moderate consequence areas” that contain as few as five dwellings within the potential impact area and would also require gas pipelines installed before 1970 that are currently exempted from certain pressure testing obligations to be tested to determine their maximum allowable operating pressures (MAOP). Other new requirements proposed by PHMSA under the rulemaking would require pipeline operators to: report to PHMSA in the event of certain MAOP exceedances; strengthen PHMSA integrity management requirements; consider seismicity in evaluating threats to a pipeline; conduct hydrostatic testing for all pipeline segments manufactured using longitudinal seam welds; and use more detailed guidance from PHMSA in the selection of assessment methods to inspect pipelines. The proposed rulemaking also seeks to impose a number of requirements on gathering lines. Additionally, in January 2017, PHMSA promulgated a new final rule regarding hazardous liquid pipelines, which increases the quality and frequency of tests that assess the condition of pipelines, requires operators to annually evaluate the existing protective measures in place for pipeline segments in HCAs, extends certain leak detection requirements for hazardous liquid pipelines not located in HCAs, and expands the list of conditions that require immediate repair. However, it is unclear when or if this rule will go into effect because, on January 20, 2017, the Trump Administration requested that all regulations that had been sent to the Office of the Federal Register, but were not yet published, be immediately withdrawn for further review. Accordingly, this rule has not become effective through publication in the Federal Register. We are monitoring and evaluating the effect of these and other emerging requirements on our operations.
States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most are certified by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. In June 2016, President Obama signed into law new legislation entitled Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (2016 Pipeline Safety Act). The 2016 Pipeline Safety Act 
10

reauthorizes PHMSA through 2019, and facilitates greater pipeline safety by providing PHMSA with emergency order authority, including authority to issue prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities to address imminent hazards, without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing, as well as enhanced release reporting requirements, requiring a review of both natural gas and hazardous liquid integrity management programs, and mandating the creation of a working group to consider the development of an information-sharing system related to integrity risk analyses. Pursuant to those provisions of the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, in October 2016 and December 2016, PHMSA issued two separate Interim Final Rules that expanded the agency’s authority to impose emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures and strengthened the rules related to underground natural gas storage facilities, including well integrity, wellbore tubing and casing integrity. The December 2016 Interim Final Rule, relating to underground gas storage facilities, went into effect in January 2017, with a compliance deadline in January 2018. PHMSA determined, however, that it will not issue enforcement citations to any operators for violations of provisions of the December 2016 Interim Final Rule that had previously been non-mandatory provisions of American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practices 1170 and 1171 until one year after PHMSA issues a final rule. In October 2017, PHMSA formally reopened the comment period on the December 2016 Interim Final Rule in response to a petition for reconsideration, with comments due in November 2017.
Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
General
Our natural gas gathering and water services activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. As an owner or operator of these facilities, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:

• | requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment, imposing emission or discharge limits or otherwise restricting the way we operate resulting in additional costs to our operations;


• | limiting or prohibiting construction activities in areas, such as air quality nonattainment areas, wetlands, coastal regions, endangered species habitat and other protected areas;


• | delaying system modification or upgrades during review of permit applications and revisions;


• | requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate discharges, releases or pollution conditions associated with our operations or attributable to former operations; and


• | enjoining operations deemed to be in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to, or regulatory requirements imposed by, such environmental laws and regulations.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties and damages. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, neighboring landowners and other third parties may file common law claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other pollutants into the environment.
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. As with the midstream industry in general, complying with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations can increase our costs to construct, maintain and operate equipment and facilities. While these laws and regulations affect our capital expenditures and net income, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows, nor do we believe that they will affect our competitive position since the operations of our competitors are generally similarly affected. In addition, we do not believe that the various activities in which we are presently engaged that are subject to environmental laws and regulations will materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability to gather natural gas or obtain and deliver water. We cannot assure you, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs. Below is a discussion of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business.
Hydraulic Fracturing Activities
11

Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Our anchor customer, EQT, regularly uses hydraulic fracturing as part of its operations. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but, in response to increased public concern regarding the alleged potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels. The EPA has also issued final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act (CAA) establishing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing, published a notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, and finalized rules in June 2016 that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA announced its intention to reconsider the CAA performance standards rule in April 2017 and has sought to stay its requirements; however, the rule remains in effect. These rules, if not changed or withdrawn, will continue to require changes to our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions. In addition, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) finalized rules in March 2015 that imposed new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. The BLM rule was struck down by a federal court in Wyoming in June 2016, but reinstated on appeal by the Tenth Circuit in September 2017. While this appeal was pending, the BLM proposed a rulemaking in July 2017 to rescind these rules in their entirety. Although the BLM published a final rule rescinding the 2015 rules in December 2017, other federal or state agencies may look to the BLM rule in developing new regulations that could apply to our operations.
Various state and federal agencies are studying the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing. In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report, contrary to several previously published draft reports issued by the EPA, found instances in which impacts to drinking water may occur. However, the report also noted significant data gaps that prevented the EPA from determining the extent or severity of these impacts. The results of such reviews or studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.  
Presently, hydraulic fracturing is regulated primarily at the state level, typically by state oil and natural gas commissions and similar agencies. In July 2015, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources issued final rules for horizontal drilling well-pad construction. Ohio, Pennsylvania (where we conduct a majority of our operations), and Texas have all adopted laws and proposed regulations that require oil and natural gas operators to disclose chemical ingredients and water volumes used to hydraulically fracture wells, in addition to more stringent well construction and monitoring requirements. In addition, in January 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) issued new rules establishing stricter disposal requirements for wastes associated with hydraulic fracturing activities, which include, among other things, a prohibition on the use of centralized impoundments for the storage of drill cuttings and waste fluids. Further, these rules include requirements relating to storage tank vandalism, secondary containment for storage vessels, construction rules for gathering lines and horizontal drilling under streams, and temporary transport lines for freshwater and wastewater. Moreover, local governments may also adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. The adoption of new laws, regulations or ordinances at the federal, state or local levels imposing more stringent restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult for our customers to complete natural gas wells, increase our customers' costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our gathering, transmission, storage and water services.
If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where our customers operate, our customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. Any such added costs, delays or restrictions for our customers could significantly affect our operations. In addition, if the amount of water needed to hydraulically fracture wells is unavailable or if flowback water disposal options become more limited, our customers may experience added costs or delays, which could significantly affect our operations.
Hazardous Waste 
The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and comparable state laws, impose requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous waste. RCRA currently exempts certain wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil and natural gas, which we handle in the course of our operations, including produced water. However, these oil and gas exploration and production wastes may still be regulated by the EPA or state agencies under RCRA’s less stringent nonhazardous solid waste provisions or other federal laws, or state laws, 
12

and it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous waste in the future. For example, from time to time certain environmental groups have petitioned or sued the EPA to remove the RCRA’s exemption for wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil and natural gas. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If such changes were to occur, it could have a significant impact on our operating costs, as well as the natural gas and oil industry in general. Moreover, some ordinary industrial wastes which we generate, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated as hazardous wastes if they have hazardous characteristics.
Site Remediation 
We currently own, lease or operate, and may have in the past owned, leased or operated, properties that have been used for the gathering of natural gas. Although we typically used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for disposal. Such petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes may have migrated to property adjacent to our owned and leased sites or the disposal sites. In addition, some of the properties may have been operated by third parties or by previous owners whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes was not under our control.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Under CERCLA, such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released, and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations, such as landfills. CERCLA authorizes the EPA, states, and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment and to seek to recover from the classes of responsible persons the costs they incur to address the release. Under CERCLA, we could be subject to strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In some states, including Pennsylvania, site remediation of oil and natural gas facilities is regulated by state agencies with jurisdiction over oil and natural gas operations. The regulated releases and remediation activities, including the classes of persons that may be held responsible for releases of hazardous substances, may be broader than those regulated under CERCLA or RCRA.
Although natural gas is excluded from CERCLA’s definition of “hazardous substance,” in the course of our ordinary operations we may handle substances or wastes designated as hazardous. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed wastes, including waste disposed of by prior owners or operators; remediate contaminated property, including groundwater contamination, whether from prior owners or operators or other historic activities or spills; or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently a potentially responsible party in any federal or state Superfund site remediation and there are no current, pending or anticipated Superfund response or remedial activities at our facilities.
Air Emissions 
The CAA, and comparable state laws, regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including natural gas processing plants and compressor stations, and also impose various preconstruction requirements, emission limits, operational limits and monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping requirements on air emission sources. Recently, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations, and/or criminal enforcement actions. Such laws and regulations, for example, require preconstruction permits, such as Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD permits, for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities with the potential to emit air pollutants above certain thresholds. Preconstruction permits generally require use of best available control technology (BACT) to limit air emissions. Several federal and state new source performance standards and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants and analogous 
13

state law requirements also apply to our facilities and operations. These applicable federal and state standards impose emission limits and operational limits as well as detailed testing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements on the facilities subject to these regulations. Several of our facilities are “major” facilities requiring Title V operating permits which impose semi-annual reporting requirements, but the number of such facilities could grow in the future. For example, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules under the CAA regarding criteria for aggregating multiple sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities (such as tank batteries and compressor stations), on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements, which in turn could result in operational delays or require us to install costly pollution control equipment. Also, in December 2016, the PADEP announced that the agency intends to issue a new general permit for oil and gas exploration, development, and production facilities and liquids loading activities, requiring best available technology for equipment and processes, enhanced record-keeping, and quarterly monitoring inspections for the control of methane emissions. The PADEP issued “draft-final” language for methane reductions from the oil and gas section in November 2017, and intends to issue similar methane rules for existing sources. The PADEP also proposed a new general permit for compressor stations that includes noise minimization requirements.
We may incur capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with complying with existing and recently proposed rules, or with obtaining or maintaining operating or preconstruction permits and complying with federal, state and local regulations related to air emissions (including air emission reporting requirements). However, we do not believe that such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations and we believe such requirements will not be any more burdensome to us than to other similarly situated companies.
Water Discharges 
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act (CWA), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including sediment, and spills and releases of oil, brine and other substances into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters or wetlands is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or a delegated state agency. In September 2015, new EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rules defining the scope of the EPA’s and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ jurisdiction became effective (2015 Clean Water Rule). To the extent the rule expands the scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for activities in wetland areas. The rule has been challenged in court on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of CWA programs, and implementation of the rule has been stayed pending resolution of the court challenge. In November 2017, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed the addition of an applicability date to the 2015 Clean Water Rule that would be two years after the date of a final rule. This change, if adopted, would effectively prevent the rule from coming back into effect immediately if the stay is lifted. The process for obtaining permits has the potential to delay our operations. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. We believe that we maintain all required discharge permits necessary to conduct our operations. Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from our operations could result in government penalties and administrative, civil or criminal liability.
Occupational Safety and Health Act 
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA). Specifically, OSHA’s hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and implementing regulations, and similar state statutes and regulations, require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to state and local government authorities and citizens. Certain of our operations are also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive material.
Endangered Species and Migratory Bird Treaty Act 
The Endangered Species Act (ESA) and analogous state laws restrict activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Some of our pipelines are located in areas that are or may be designated as protected habitats for endangered or threatened species, including the Indiana Bat, which has a seasonal impact on our construction activities and operations. The future listing of previously unprotected species in areas where we conduct or may conduct operations, or the designation of critical habitat in these areas, could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our operating activities, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. For example, in April 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the northern long-eared bat, whose habitat includes the areas in which we operate, as a threatened 
14

species under the ESA. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit access to protected areas that lay within our areas of operation.
Climate Change 
In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that establish pre-construction and operating permit requirements for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources. Under these regulations, for example, facilities required to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permits because they are potential major sources of criteria pollutants must comply with BACT-driven GHG permit limits established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA, on a case-by-case basis. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain onshore oil and natural gas processing and fractionating facilities, as well as gathering and boosting facilities. We are monitoring GHG emissions from our operations in accordance with the GHG emissions reporting rule. Also, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules that impose volatile organic compound emissions limits (and collaterally reduce methane emissions) on certain types of compressors and pneumatic pumps, as well as requiring the development and implementation of leak monitoring plans for compressor stations. The EPA announced its intention to reconsider certain of these rules in April 2017 and has sought to stay their requirements; however, the rules remain in effect. These regulations, if not changed or withdrawn, will continue to require changes to our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions. The EPA has also announced that it intends to pursue, but has not yet proposed, methane emission standards for existing sources in addition to new sources. Several states are also pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of GHGs from new and existing sources. If enacted or promulgated, additional GHG regulations could impose new compliance costs and permitting burdens on our operations.
Also, in November 2016, the BLM finalized, and in December 2016 the PADEP announced that it intends to propose rules related to the control of methane emissions. Certain provisions of the BLM rule went into effect in January 2017, while others were scheduled to go into effect in January 2018. In December 2017, BLM published a final rule delaying the 2018 provisions until 2019. The final draft of the PADEP rule was released in November 2017, and the PADEP hopes to finalize the regulations in early 2018. Compliance with rules to control methane emissions will likely require enhanced record-keeping practices, the purchase of new equipment such as optical gas imaging instruments to detect leaks, and the increased frequency of maintenance and repair activities to address emissions leakage. The rules will also likely require hiring additional personnel to support these activities or the engagement of third party contractors to assist with and verify compliance. These new rules could result in increased compliance costs on our operations. The PADEP also recently announced an initiative to restrict methane emissions from natural gas development activities. Under the proposed changes, operators in Pennsylvania would need to (i) obtain an air quality general permit in advance of operations, (ii) control releases, and (iii) report emissions.
Additionally, while Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, the prospect for adoption of significant legislation at the federal level to reduce GHG emissions is perceived to be low at this time. However, many states have adopted cap and trade programs or renewable energy portfolio standards in an effort to reduce GHG emissions, and these efforts are likely to continue absent additional federal action. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that limit emissions of GHGs could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that exploration and production operators produce, some of whom are our customers, which could thereby reduce demand for our midstream services. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, it is uncertain if they would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to make distributions to our unitholders.
Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this will continue.
