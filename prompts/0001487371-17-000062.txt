Item 1. | BUSINESS


GenMark Diagnostics, Inc., or GenMark, is a molecular diagnostics company focused on developing and commercializing multiplex molecular tests that aid in the diagnosis of complex medical conditions and help guide therapy decisions. References herein to “we,” “us” or “our” refer to GenMark Diagnostics, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless the context specifically requires otherwise.

Overview

We currently develop and commercialize high-value, simple to perform, clinically relevant multiplex molecular tests based on our proprietary eSensor electrochemical detection technology. We currently sell our XT-8 instrument and related diagnostic and research tests, as well as certain custom manufactured reagents, which collectively we refer to as our XT-8 system. Our XT-8 system supports a broad range of molecular tests with a compact and easy-to-use workstation and disposable test cartridges. In addition, we have developed and are commercializing of our sample-to-answer ePlex instrument and Respiratory Pathogen (RP) Panel. We intend to offer a number of additional associated diagnostic tests for use with our ePlex instrument, which we collectively refer to as our ePlex system. 
Since inception, we have incurred net losses from operations each year, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $50.6 million and $42.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $355.3 million. Our operations to date have been funded principally through sales of capital stock, borrowings, and cash from operations. We expect to incur increasing expenses over the next several years, principally to commercialize our ePlex system, as well as to further increase our manufacturing capabilities and domestic and international commercial organization. 
Our Strategy

Our goal is to become the market leading provider of automated, multiplex molecular diagnostic testing systems. In order to achieve this objective, we intend to:


• | Successfully Commercialize our ePlex System. We believe the ePlex system is an attractive solution for a broad range of hospitals and laboratories that lack the technical or economic resources to perform molecular diagnostic testing with existing products and technology. We believe the ePlex system will expand our current potential user base from approximately 1,000 domestic customers to approximately 12,000 potential customers globally. 


• | Expand our Menu of Clinical Diagnostic Products. We intend to develop a broad menu of molecular diagnostic tests for our ePlex system that we believe will satisfy important medical needs and present attractive commercial opportunities. For example, in June 2016 we obtained CE Mark of our ePlex instrument and RP Panel, and in December 2016 we submitted 510(k) applications to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for our ePlex instrument and RP Panel. During 2017, we intend to complete the development of, CE Mark, and submit 510(k) applications to the FDA our ePlex blood culture identification (BCID) family of panels, which include a gram-positive (GP), a gram-negative (GN), and a fungal pathogen panel. In addition, we are actively evaluating the development of additional assay panels that we believe will meet important, unmet clinical needs, which our ePlex system is uniquely positioned to address. 


• | Grow our Installed Base of Customers. We have identified those laboratories and hospitals that we believe will benefit from our product portfolio. We intend to leverage our commercial organization to drive placements of our ePlex system both domestically and internationally. We anticipate that the expansion of our installed base of customers will drive sales of our test cartridges, from which we anticipate generating the majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future. 


• | Increase Test Utilization. We intend to increase the use of our diagnostic tests by developing and offering tools and support tailored to our products such as education programs and seminars, product training for our customers, and reimbursement support. These activities are designed to aid in establishing the clinical and health economic utility of multiplex molecular diagnostic tests, which we believe will increase adoption of our products. 

Revenues, net loss, and total assets for the past three years are contained in our consolidated financial statements in Part II of this Annual Report. Substantially all of our revenues for the periods reported in our consolidated financial statements in Part II of this Annual Report were derived from customers located within the United States.

Our Technology
Our eSensor Technology
Our proprietary eSensor technology is based on the principles of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, hybridization and electrochemical detection. DNA naturally forms a double-stranded structure, with each strand binding with high affinity, or hybridizing, only to a complementary strand. Our technology takes advantage of this highly specific binding by first creating two types of single-stranded DNA, the capture probe and the signal probe. The capture probe and signal probe are each complementary to a different segment of the target DNA that is the focus of the particular diagnostic test. Using our technology and processes, we attach our capture probes to a proprietary monolayer on the surface of a gold electrode within our test cartridges. We separately attach ferrocene, a proprietary label, to our signal probes.
Before placing the sample into our XT-8 test cartridge, the technician mixes the amplified DNA sample with our signal probe. If the target biomarker is present in the prepared patient sample, a segment of the biomarker DNA will hybridize with a solution containing our signal probe. This solution is then run past an electrode, against which our capture probes have been immobilized. The as-yet unbound segment of the target biomarker binds to our capture probe, creating a target DNA, signal probe, capture probe complex at the surface of the electrode. This complex produces an electrochemical signal which is analyzed and interpreted by our XT-8 system. 
With our ePlex sample-to-answer test cartridges, the operator adds a patient sample directly or with minimal preparation into the sample chamber, closes the lid, and inserts the test cartridge into the ePlex instrument. Within the instrument, the same steps performed by a technician with the XT-8 system are performed within the ePlex test cartridge, resulting in the delivery of target DNA and signal probes to the eSensor electrodes within the ePlex cartridge. As with XT-8, when a complex forms as a result of a target match, the complex produces an electrochemical signal that is interpreted by the ePlex system.
Our XT-8 and ePlex test cartridges utilize the combination of distinct electrodes and multiple signal probes to detect dozens of target biomarkers from a single sample, thereby enabling highly multiplexed testing. Our eSensor technology is highly specific for the target biomarker, and is not based on optical or fluorescent detection. As a result, our diagnostic tests are less prone to sample contamination risk and do not require many of the time-consuming washing and preparation steps required by competing technologies. The sample preparation steps required before using our XT-8 test cartridges are nucleic acid purification and a polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, amplification, which involves amplifying, or generating billions of copies of the target DNA molecules, followed by transfer of the sample to our test cartridge and insertion of the test cartridge into any open module in our XT-8 system. In some XT-8 tests, amplified DNA is subject to an additional enzymatic treatment to produce a single-stranded-DNA. In contrast, the ePlex system generally requires no pre-analytic steps to be performed by the user, except, in limited cases, certain minimal up-front sample handling.
We believe our proprietary electrochemical detection technology has several advantages over other signal detection platforms, including high sensitivity and accuracy, streamlined sample preparation, efficient multiplexing, effective use of lab space, low maintenance, and the ability to cost-effectively develop additional tests.
Digital Microfluidics
Digital microfluidics is another innovative technology included within our ePlex system which we have exclusively licensed within a defined field of use from an affiliate of Illumina, Inc. Digital microfluidics is a technique for moving small droplets of liquid using electrowetting, a process for making a surface hydrophobic or hydrophilic based on the application of a voltage to a surface. Our ePlex printed circuit board contains eSensor electrodes capable of nucleic acid detection along with electrowetting electrodes capable of digital microfluidics. The ePlex system uses numerous choreographed digital inputs to perform the fluid manipulations associated with sample-to-answer molecular diagnostics. Drops are dispensed, mixed, merged, heated, cooled, split and delivered, all under precise and programmable digital control. In this manner, standard procedures of the molecular diagnostics lab (e.g., DNA purification, PCR, exonuclease digestion, etc.) can be performed automatically within our ePlex cartridge.
 Our Instrument Systems

Our XT-8 System.    Our XT-8 instrument is a post-PCR multiplex workstation that has a modular design consisting of an integrated touch screen and up to three analyzers. Each analyzer contains eight modules into which individual test cartridges are placed. The test cartridge modules operate independently of each other allowing up to 24 independent test cartridges to be loaded at one time, with the remaining modules available for use at any future time while the system is running.

Research and Development

Our research and development (R&D) team is focused on expanding our ePlex test menu. In addition, our R&D team is supporting the following initiatives:

• | On Market Product Support. A role of our R&D team is to assist our manufacturing and quality assurance teams in ensuring high product quality and thorough complaint handling and investigation. This team also supports improvements in quality control methods and metrics and are active participants in the continuous improvement processes utilized by our product manufacturing teams. 


• | Improving the Clinical and Practical Utility of our Tests. Our R&D organization also supports the clinical utility and value of our molecular diagnostic tests. We have previously and intend to continue to partner with academic and reference laboratories to perform validation and clinical studies on our tests. Key aspects of our efforts are aimed at improving workflow in the laboratory setting, positively comparing our tests to historical or “gold standard” tests, and demonstrating that our tests can help improve patient care and lower diagnostic and medical treatment costs. We intend to publish the results from these clinical studies in peer-reviewed or trade journals, submit them to regulatory bodies and present them at industry conferences in support of our commercialization strategy. 

Manufacturing

We manufacture our proprietary test cartridges, certain related components and ancillary reagents in our Carlsbad, California facilities. We perform reagent formulation, test cartridge manufacturing and packaging of final components and test cartridges in accordance with applicable guidelines for medical device manufacturing. We currently lease an aggregate of approximately 87,000 square feet at two nearby locations in Carlsbad, California, where we maintain our corporate office and manufacturing facilities.
We currently outsource the manufacture of our XT-8 instrument to Leica Biosystems Melbourne Pty Ltd., or Leica, and outsource the manufacture of our ePlex instrument to Plexus Corp, or Plexus. We rely on third party suppliers, including in certain instances, sole source suppliers, for certain raw materials and other supplies and components used in our products.

We have implemented a quality management system designed to comply with FDA regulations and ISO standards governing diagnostic medical device products. These regulations control the design, manufacture, testing and release of diagnostics products, as well as raw material receipt and control. In 2012, our Carlsbad, California corporate headquarters facility obtained ISO 13485 certification. We control methods for the consistent manufacturing of our proprietary test cartridges and reagents at our facilities. Our key outsourcing partners are regularly audited to help ensure a continual supply of high quality components.
We plan to continue to manufacture components that we determine are highly proprietary or highly customized, while outsourcing more commodity-like components. We are likely to establish additional outsourcing partnerships as we manufacture additional products.

Sales and Marketing

Our current sales and marketing strategy is to expand our business globally with the commercialization of our ePlex system in the United States and Europe, while also continuing to support the placement and use of our XT-8 system in the United States. Our products are sold in the United States through a geographically dispersed direct sales and technically specialized service organization, which is supported by a centralized team of product managers and marketing, customer support, and technical support personnel. We utilize a direct sales and technical support team to sell our ePlex system in certain key European countries, which are augmented by distributors in other locations internationally. 
Our sales representatives typically have experience in molecular diagnostics and a network of laboratory contacts within their respective territories. We utilize our representatives’ knowledge along with market research databases to target and qualify our customers. We execute a variety of sales campaigns and strategies to meet the buying criteria of the different customer segments we serve. To support the growth in our customer base and our launch plans for our ePlex system, we continue to make investments in these customer facing organizations.
Our sales cycle typically includes customer evaluations and validations of our products. Upon successful validation, a customer may generally acquire our instrument system in the following ways:
 6


• | Capital Purchase: The instrument is paid for upfront and in its entirety by the customer. Customers are also eligible to receive structured pricing incentives if they enter into an optional annual minimum cartridge purchase commitment. 


• | Reagent Rental: A reagent rental agreement requires that a customer commit to purchase a minimum number of test cartridges over the term of the agreement, and a portion of the charge for each cartridge is attributable to a usage fee for the instrument. 

Customers

Our target customers include hospital-based laboratories and research institutions. We believe our ePlex system will expand our current potential user base from approximately 1,000 domestic customers to approximately 12,000 potential customers globally. In 2016 and 2015, Laboratory Corporation of America, Inc. represented 27% and 17%, respectively, of our total revenue. In 2014, no single customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue. 
Competition 

We primarily face competition in the molecular diagnostic testing markets with testing products and systems developed by public and private companies such as bioMerieux (which acquired Biofire Diagnostics, Inc.), Luminex Corporation (which acquired Nanosphere, Inc.), Danaher Corporation (which acquired Cephied), Siemens, Hologic, Inc., Seegene, Roche Diagnostics and Abbott Molecular Diagnostics. Our diagnostic tests also face competition with laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, developed by national and regional reference laboratories and hospitals. We believe that our testing systems compete largely on the basis of accuracy, reliability, enhanced laboratory workflow, multiplex capability, ease-of-use and return on investment for customers. 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, research and other resources and larger, more established marketing, sales and distribution organizations than we do. Many of our competitors also offer broader product lines and have greater brand recognition than we do. Moreover, our existing and new competitors may make rapid technological developments that may result in our technologies and products becoming obsolete before we recover the expenses incurred to develop them or before they generate significant revenue.
Intellectual Property

To establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products, we rely on a combination of our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as other intellectual property rights in our technology and business information. Our intellectual property portfolio for our core electrochemical technology was initially built through the combination of our acquisition of the Clinical Micro Sensors business from Motorola and licensing patents from the California Institute of Technology. We also have exclusively licensed the digital microfluidics technology utilized in our ePlex system within a defined field of use from an affiliate of Illumina.

We believe that our patent portfolio, which includes over 100 owned and exclusively licensed U.S. and foreign patents and approximately 30 pending applications, provides us with extensive protection of our eSensor systems. We continue to pursue the issuance of new patents to protect our ongoing research, development and commercial activities, in particular with respect to our ePlex system and related consumables. In general, patents have a term of at least 20 years from the application filing date or earlier claimed priority date. A majority of our issued and exclusively licensed patents are scheduled to expire by 2021, with approximately one half of the patents expiring by 2018. Several of our pending applications have the potential to mature into patents that may expire between 2028 and 2034. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to police infringement and continue to develop proprietary products and technologies without infringing the intellectual property rights of others.

We also rely in part on trade secret protection of our intellectual property. We attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants. Our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in intellectual property, such as patents and copyrights arising from their work for us. All employees sign an agreement not to compete unfairly with us during their employment and upon termination of their employment through the misuse of confidential information.

We also have filed for registration, or obtained registration, in the U.S. and other countries for marks used with our products and technology. Our issued trademarks in the United States and/or Europe include eSensor®, word and design marks for GenMark®, GenMark DX®, eSensor®, XT-8®, eSensor XT-8®, ePlex®, and GenMark ePlex®, among others.

Government Regulation

The design, development, manufacture, testing and sale of our molecular diagnostic products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA, and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies.

Regulation by the FDA

In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, FDA regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. The FDA regulates the design, manufacturing, servicing, sale and distribution of medical devices, including molecular diagnostic test kits and instrumentation systems. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the United States will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution. 
The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization required applicable to a device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, also called PMA. We have obtained 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the following molecular diagnostic tests for use on our XT-8 system: the Respiratory Viral panel, the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Test, the Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Test, and the Thrombophilia Risk Test. In December 2016, we filed 510(k) applications with the FDA for our ePlex instrument and RP Panel.
Proposed Regulation of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs). In October 2014, the FDA promulgated draft guidance which describes a new proposed regulatory framework for LDTs. Based on this proposal, clinical laboratories that develop and use LDTs would be required to comply with specific regulatory requirements (e.g., adverse even reporting, quality system regulation, or QSR, premarket submission, and FDA review) prior to the use of LDTs for clinical diagnostic purposes. The timeline for phasing in the proposed regulatory requirements would begin upon finalization of the FDA guidance document. The ultimate impact of this draft guidance on our customers remains uncertain. 

Regulation after FDA Clearance or Approval.    Any devices we manufacture or distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. We are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which includes testing, control and documentation requirements. Non-compliance with these standards can result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions. We have designed and implemented quality system processes within our manufacturing facilities in order to comply with FDA’s GMP requirements.

Because we are a medical device manufacturer, we must also comply with FDA’s medical device reporting requirements whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that one of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.
Labeling, advertising, and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution. We have implemented quality system processes and advertising/promotional policies designed to comply with these requirements.

Environmental Regulations.    We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. Some of these laws require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct our operations. We have numerous policies and quality system procedures in place to ensure compliance with these laws and to minimize the risk of occupational exposure to hazardous materials. We do not expect the operations of our products to produce significant quantities of hazardous or toxic waste or radiation that would require the use of extraordinary disposal practices. Although the costs to comply with these applicable laws and regulations have not been material, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, nor can we ensure we will be able to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits.
 8

Export of Our Products.    Medical devices that are legally marketed in the U.S. may be exported anywhere in the world without prior FDA notification or approval. Devices that have not been approved or cleared in the U.S. must follow the export provisions of the FDCA. Depending on which section of the FDCA we may export under, we may need to request an export permit letter or export certificate, or we may need to submit a simple notification. Export certificates may be requested by foreign customers or foreign governments to provide proof of the products’ status as regulated by the FDA. The export certificate is prepared by the FDA and contains information about a product’s regulatory or marketing status in the United States.

Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988.    The use of our products is also affected by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, and related federal and state regulations, which provide for regulation of laboratory testing. Any customers using our products for clinical use in the United States will be regulated under CLIA, which establishes quality standards for all laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test was performed. In particular, these regulations mandate that clinical laboratories must be certified by the federal government or a federally approved accreditation agency, or must be located in a state that has been deemed exempt from CLIA requirements because the state has in effect laws that provide for requirements equal to or more stringent than CLIA requirements. Moreover, these laboratories must meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards, and they must undergo proficiency testing and inspections. The CLIA standards applicable to clinical laboratories are based on the complexity of the method of testing performed by the laboratory, which range from “waived” to “moderate complexity” to “high complexity.” We expect that most of our products will be categorized as “high complexity,” since most molecular diagnostic tests are currently FDA-cleared as CLIA “high complexity” devices.

Foreign Government Regulation.    We intend to market our products in European and other select international markets. The regulatory pre-market requirements for in vitro diagnostic, or IVD, devices vary from country to country. Some countries impose product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements and import restrictions on devices. Each country has its own tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

Fraud and Abuse Regulations

We are subject to numerous federal and state health care anti-fraud laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute and False Claims Act, or the FCA, that are intended to reduce waste, fraud and abuse in the health care industry. These laws are broad and subject to evolving interpretations. They prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in industries other than health care, including certain payments for consulting and other personal services, some discounting arrangements, the provision of gifts and business courtesies, the furnishing of free supplies and services, and waivers of payments. In addition, many states have enacted or are considering laws that limit arrangements between medical device manufacturers and physicians and other health care providers and require significant public disclosure concerning permitted arrangements. These laws are vigorously enforced against medical device manufacturers and have resulted in manufacturers paying significant fines and penalties and being subject to stringent corrective action plans and reporting obligations. We must operate our business within the requirements of these laws and, if we were accused of violating them, we could be forced to expend significant resources on investigation, remediation and monetary penalties.
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act

Our operations are affected by the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to as the Health Care Act. The Health Care Act imposes a 2.3% excise tax on sales of medical devices by manufacturers. In December 2015, the excise tax was suspended for 2016 and 2017. We are unable to predict whether the suspension will be continued beyond 2017. Taxable devices include any medical device defined in section 201(h) of the FDCA and intended for use by humans, with limited exclusions for devices purchased by the general public at retail for individual use. There is no exemption for small companies, and we paid the tax from January 2013 through December 2015. The Health Care Act also requires manufacturers to report to the Department of Health and Human Services detailed information about financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals. These reporting provisions preempt state laws that require reporting of the same information, but not those that require reports of different or additional information. Failure to comply with these requirements subjects the manufacturer to significant civil monetary penalties.
Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we had 308 employees, of which: 163 employees were involved in research and development; 51 in operations, manufacturing and quality assurance; 62 in sales and marketing; and 32 in general and administrative functions. Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees. We face competition in this 
 9

regard from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Corporate and Available Information

Our corporate office is located at 5964 La Place Court, Carlsbad, California. We also lease additional manufacturing space nearby to our corporate office in Carlsbad, California.

We make available, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. We also make these documents and certain public financial information available on our website, which is www.genmarkdx.com. Our SEC reports and other financial information can be accessed through the investor relations section of our website. Some of the information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC.
