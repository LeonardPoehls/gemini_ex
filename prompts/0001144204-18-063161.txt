ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
Unless the context indicates otherwise, as used herein the terms “General Steel”, the “Company”, “we”, “our” and “us” all refer to General Steel Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 
We were incorporated on August 5, 2002, in the State of Nevada. We are headquartered in Beijing, China and through our 100% owned subsidiary, General Steel Investment, we have been operating steel companies serving various industries in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). Our main operation through December 30, 2015 had been the manufacturing and sales of steel products such as steel rebar, hot-rolled carbon and silicon sheets and spiral-weld pipes.
 
On November 4, 2015, the Board authorized the Company's management to pursue the potential sale of all its ownership in Maoming Hengda Steel Company, Ltd. ("Maoming Hengda") and Longmen Joint Venture to divest from and restructure the steel business. On December 30, 2015, we sold our equity interest in General Steel (China) Co., Ltd and Longmen Joint Venture. On March 21, 2016, we sold our equity interest in Maoming Hengda and completed the divestiture of our steel business as planned.
 
In October 2015, we completed our acquisition of an 84.5% equity interest in Catalon Chemical Corp. (“Catalon”), a Delaware corporation headquartered in Virginia that develops and manufactures De-NOx honeycomb catalysts and industrial ceramics.  Prior to December 31, 2015, we became aware of operational issues related to Catalon. It was determined that such issues might have affected Catalon’s prior operations, as well as its ability to conduct business in the future. As such, at the time weexpected to cancel the shares issued to the 84.5% original owners of Catalon in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Because we have decided to dispose of Catalon in the near future, the Company presented Catalon’s remaining assets, after impairment charges, and liabilities as held for sale as of December 31, 2015. On March 31, 2016 the Company has decided to dispose of Catalon, so the result of operations of Catalon was presented as discontinued operations in December 31, 2016 in the consolidated financial statements. On September 21, 2018, the shares issued to Catalon were cancelled.
 
Our remaining steel business is primarily comprised of Tianjin Shuangsi Trading Co. Ltd, (“Tianjin Shuangsi”), a trading company that mainly sources overseas iron ore for steel mills. We acquired a 100% equity interest in Tianjin Shuangsi on February 16, 2016. On December 31, 2017, the Company sold Shuangsi to Wendler Investment & Management Group Co., Ltd, a related party, no consideration was received. Therefore the results of operations was presented as operations to be disposed in December 31, 2016 in the consolidated financial statements See Note 2(o) – Operations held for sale and operations disposed/to be disposed.
 
As a result of this restructuring, our former steel-related subsidiaries, including Longmen Joint Venture (prior to December 30, 2015), Maoming Hengda and our recently acquired non steel-related subsidiary, Catalon and Shuangsi, all of which represented a majority of our consolidated sales and operations, are presented as discontinued operations or operations held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 
Recent Developments
 
On July 18, 2016, we received a notice from the staff of the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) stating that the NYSE had determined to commence proceedings to delist our common stock, and our common stock would be suspended at the close of trading on the same date.
 
In the notice and in a public announcement distributed by the NYSE on July 18, 2016, the NYSE stated that we were previously deemed below compliance with the NYSE’s continued listing standard requiring listed companies to maintain either (i) at least $50 million in stockholders’ equity or (ii) at least $50 million in total market capitalization on a 30 trading day average basis. The NYSE noted that they had previously accepted our 18-month plan to regain compliance with the listing standard. However, the NYSE stated that as of the expiration of the plan period on July 9, 2016, we were unable to demonstrate that we had regained compliance with the applicable continued listing standard. The NYSE also included in its public announcement that we were delayed in filing with the SEC of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter end March 31, 2016.

We appealed the delisting determination by submitting a request for review in writing to the NYSE Regulations, Inc., Board of Directors’ Committee for Review (the “CFR”)
 
Prior to the NYSE notice, we had presented to the NYSE the steps we intended to take to address the deficiencies raised by the staff at NYSE. We reached an agreement with a number of our current debt holders to forgive existing debt and/or exchange debt for equity, which when completed, would have increased our stockholders’ equity to at least $50 million thereby satisfying the NYSE’s continued listing standard.
 
On October 20, 2016, we received a letter from the CFR that our appeal was denied. On October 25, 2016, our common stock was delisted.
 
Change in Control
 
On August 24, 2018, the Company entered into a subscription agreement with Hummingbird Holdings Limited, a BVI entity . Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, the Investor purchased 7,352,941 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, representing 29.7% of our issued and outstanding common stock at a purchase price of $0.034 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $250,000. Victory New Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands entity controlled by our chief executive officer. Mr. Zuosheng Yu, entered into a stock purchase agreement with Hummingbird whereby it sold 3,092,899 of our Series A Preferred Stock, representing 100% of our Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, Mr. Yu sold to Hummingbird (i) 944,780 shares of common stock held in his name and (ii) 4,800,000 shares of common stock held in the name of Golden Eight Investments Limited (‘‘Golden Eight’’), of which Mr. Yu is the sole director of Golden Eight. As a result of the transactions, Hummingbird owns 52.9% of our issued and outstanding common stock and through ownership of our Series A Preferred Stock has voting power of 30% of the combined voting power of our common stock and preferred stock.
Subsidiaries
 
We presently have controlling interests in one subsidiary under continuing operations:
 

· | Tongyong Shengyuan (Tianjin) Technology Development Co., Ltd. (“Tongyong Shengyuan”) which is a holding company and its main operations is the 32% equity investment in in Tianwu General Steel Material Trading Co., Ltd.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Operations held for sale:
 
Our remaining steel business is primarily comprised of Tianjin Shuangsi Trading Co. Ltd, (“Tianjin Shuangsi”), a trading company that mainly sources overseas iron ore for steel mills. We acquired a 100% equity interest in Tianjin Shuangsi on February 16, 2016. On December 31, 2017, the Company sold Shuangsi to Wendler Investment & Management Group Co., Ltd, a related party, no consideration was received.
 
Subsidiaries disposed:
 
Maoming Hengda Steel Co., Ltd
 
On June 25, 2008, through our subsidiary Qiu Steel, we paid approximately $7.1 million (RMB 50 million) in cash to purchase 99% of Maoming Hengda Steel Group, Ltd. (“Maoming Hengda”).  The total registered capital of Maoming Hengda is approximately $77.8 million (RMB 544.6 million)
 
Maoming Hengda’s core business was the production of rebar products used in the construction industry.  Located on 140 hectares (approximately 346 acres) in Maoming city, Guangdong Province, the Maoming Hengda facility previously had two production lines capable of annual production capacities of 1.8 million metric tons of 5.5mm to 16mm diameter high-speed wire and 12mm to 38mm diameter rebar. The products were sold through nine distributors that targeted customers in Guangxi Province and the western region of Guangdong. To take advantage of a stronger market demand in Shaanxi Province, between 2009 and 2010, we relocated the 1.8 million metric ton capacity rebar production line and high-speed wire production line from Maoming Hengda's facility to Longmen Joint Venture.

In December 2010, we brought online a new 400,000 ton capacity rebar production line. On December 15, 2013, Maoming Hengda entered into a lease agreement with Zhongshan Baohua Rebar Factory, with which Maoming Hengda leased the 400,000 ton capacity rebar production line and various other buildings and equipment to Zhongshan Baohua Rebar Factory, for an annual payment of $1.2 million (RMB 7.2 million) for eight years between March 2014 and February 2022.
 
Management evaluates the fair value of Maoming Hengda’s long-lived assets on an annual basis, or upon a triggering event which would require an assessment sooner. As of December 31, 2015, Management is of the opinion that the fair value of the property, plant and equipment exceeded their current carrying value.
 
On March 21, 2016, we sold our equity interest in Maoming Hengda to Tianwu Tongyong (Tianjin) International Trade Co., Ltd, ("Tianwu Tongyong"), for which the Company already had 32% equity interest in, for RMB 328.0 million in cash or approximately $50.5 million and with this transaction completed the full divestiture of our steel manufacturing and distribution business was completed. The agreement was further amended in September 2016 to set the sale price at RMB 155.3 million or approximately $23.9 million. The Company expected to receive its 99% ownership for the total proceeds of RMB 154.0 million (approximately $23.8 million), of which the full amount would be paid within one year after the signing of the Agreement.
 
Accordingly, the Company recorded the total amount of net consideration of $45.7 million in additional-paid-in capital.
 

Catalon Chemical Corp. 
 
In October 2015, we acquired an 84.5% equity interest in Catalon Chemical Corp. (“Catalon”), a Delaware corporation headquartered in Virginia that develops and manufactures De-NOx honeycomb catalysts and industrial ceramics.  Prior to December 31, 2015, we became aware of some operational issues related to Catalon. It was determined that such issues might have affected Catalon’s prior operations as well as its ability to conduct business in the future. As such, we are expected to cancel the shares issued to the 84.5% original owners of Catalon in accordance with the terms of the agreement at the end of 2016. Because we have decided to dispose of Catalon in the near future, we are presenting Catalon’s remaining assets, after impairment charges, and liabilities as held for sale as of December 31, 2015 in the consolidated financial statements. Due to operational issues, Catalon was not able to meet the Minimum Sales Target or Minimum Net Profit applicable as stipulated in the Stock Exchange agreement, therefore the board has voted unanimously to cancel the shares that were placed in escrow for the selling shareholders. As such the Company deconsolidated Catalon on March 31, 2016. See Note 2(o) in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.

Marketing and Customers
 
Since we completed the divestiture of our steel manufacturing business the Company’s remaining business is primarily comprised of Tianjin Shuangsi Trading Co. Ltd. (“Tianjin Shuangsi”), a trading company in which the Company acquired 100% of the equity interest on February 16, 2016 for contract price of RMB19 million and debt assumed of RMB 18.8 million for a net purchase price of $0.03 million as Tianjin Shuangsi was established by the chief executive officer of a related entity of the Company, and the CEO’s relative. Tianjin Shuangsi primarily trades iron ore, nickel-iron-manganese alloys, and other steel-related products.
 
Our revenue is dependent, in large part, on significant contracts with a limited number of large customers, including related parties. For the year ended December 31, 2016, three of the Company’s customers, including related parties, individually accounted for 33.0%, 29.5% and 6.3% of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Moreover, our success will depend in part upon our ability to obtain orders from new customers, as well as the financial condition and success of our customers and general economic conditions in China.
 
Industry Environment
 
China’s steel industry is highly fragmented, and the Chinese government continues to encourage industry consolidation. The Chinese central government has had a long-stated goal to consolidate 60% of domestic steel production among the top ten producers by 2015, and expanding to 70% by 2020. The top ten producers’ output fell to 39% of the national output in 2013 from 49% in 2010, which is still below the 60% target for 2015 set in the 12th year plan.
 
Despite the government’s initiatives to encourage industry consolidation and cut over-capacity, it is estimated that new capacity of approximately 20~25 million metric tons was added in 2014. Excess supply, weakening economic growth, and sagging prices have resulted in depressed margins and operating losses. According to statistics by China Iron and Steel Association, the blended net margin of China steel enterprises in 2014 was only 0.85%, with approximately 15% of major steel companies monitored by China Iron and Steel Association still incurring operating losses.
 
 On July 12, 2010, the Ministry of Industry & Information Technology enacted the Steel Industry Admittance and Operation Qualifications standards. The new standards specify requirements for all aspects of steel production in China, which include: size of blast furnaces, size of converters, emission of waste water, dust per ton from steel production, quantity of coal used for each process in steel production and output capacity.  According to the new standards, blast furnaces under 450 cubic meters are targeted to be eliminated. These standards once again confirmed the central government’s determination to push forward the consolidation of this fragmented industry.
 
Since 2013, the government has exerted a more stringent environment protection policy on the steel industry. In January 2014, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China (the "MIIT") announced a List of Enterprises Fulfilling the Iron and Steel Industry Specification (the "List"). The List includes a highly-selected group of large and medium steel manufacturers that have met or exceeded more stringent national requirements and standards on product quality, environmental protection, energy consumption, workmanship and equipment, production scale, as well as work safety and social responsibility. The MIIT will collaborate with China's other governmental agencies to provide support to the List's members and to speed up the steel industry's restructuring and consolidation. Steel makers omitted from the List will most likely face higher electricity costs, more restrictive administrative measures, and adverse effects of forceful regulations intent on reducing the nation's overcapacity. Longmen Joint Venture, which was our major facility, is included on the List as one of the key steel enterprises in China’s Shaanxi Province.
 
In 2016, the state's efforts to promote the structural reform of the supply side, the steel industry was able to achieve the goals of steel production control and therefore demand steadily increased. Steel price and overall profitability of the industry was improved compared to 2016. However, due to weak demand growth, overall inventory level is still high. We therefore rely on the trading business of iron ore and steel, with the expectation that steel industry environment will gradually improve due to decrease in inventory level.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 11 full-time employees.
