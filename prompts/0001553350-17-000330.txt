ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
History
 
MediXall Group, Inc. (formerly Continental Rail Corp.) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on December 21, 1998 under the name IP Gate, Inc. 

On December 31, 2002, IP Gate, Inc. entered into a share exchange agreement and merged with Action Stocks, Inc., a Nevada corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, the original shareholders of IP Gate retained ownership of their shares and Action Stocks shareholders received 14.25 shares of the surviving corporation for each share they owned prior to the merger. The management of the former Action Stocks became the officers and directors of the surviving corporation, which then changed its name to Action Stocks, Inc. 

On June 3, 2003, Action Stocks merged with Classic Health Systems. Classic Health Systems was in the Durable Medical Goods industry delivering equipment for home care such as oxygen, ventilators, beds, and CPAPs. 

On June 23, 2003 Action Stocks changed its name to Specialized Home Medical Services, Inc. as a result of the acquisition of Classic Health Systems Inc. which continued as a wholly owned subsidiary. On January 3, 2006, the officers and directors resigned in favor of a new board and the incoming President and CEO purchased a block of treasury stock, and became the majority shareholder. Immediately following this change of control, the new management added another wholly owned subsidiary, South East Stamp Sales, LLC in order to expand the companys operations. This new subsidiary provided cataloging and valuation services for auction companies. In December 2007, the durable medical equipment business and inventory was sold for cash to a similar business operating in the same market, due to declining sales. 

Specialized Home Medical Services changed its name to IGSM Group, Inc. in April 2007 to reflect its diverse operations and the removal of the medical related business. The South East Stamp Sales, LLC subsidiary continued operations until December 2009, when it lost the majority of its business due to an economic downturn in its primary customer. The company attempted to engage in an internet technology business through a licensing or acquisition strategy, but it was unsuccessful. 

Late December 2012, the Company contracted the services of TBG Holdings Corporation (TBG) who assisted with restructuring the Company into a short-line and regional freight railroad holding company. On June 23, 2013, IGSM Group entered into a share exchange agreement with Transportation Management Services, Inc. under which IGSM acquired all of the outstanding stock of TMS in exchange for the issuance of 1,500,000 shares of preferred IGSM stock. TMS was in the business of providing consulting services to railroad companies. IGSM Group changed its name to Continental Rail Corp effective July 10, 2013. 

On June 19, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Continental Rail, LLC (LLC), a Florida limited liability company, and the Series A Preferred Shareholders of the Company. The Company was actively seeking to secure financing for the purchase of the Delta Southern Railroad (Delta), a Class III short-line railroad headquartered in Tallulah, Louisiana. Delta was subsequently purchased by Golden Gate Capital (Golden Gate), a private equity firm in San Francisco, California. Golden Gate decided that it was in its best interest to utilize the railroad operations management skills of certain Preferred Shareholders of the Company to manage the daily operations of Delta (the Manager). By the terms of the Agreement, however the Delta Manager cannot be owned (more than 10%) or controlled by a public company. Consequently, the LLC was organized by the Preferred Shareholders as the vehicle to manage Delta and satisfy the conditions set forth in the agreement. In conjunction with this transaction the Company received a 10% interest in the LLC and the preferred shareholders returned their preferred shares to the Company for cancelation. 

On June 24, 2016, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with TBG where the Company exchanged 100% of its membership interest in the LLC in exchange for 1,000,000 shares of the Company held by TBG. The exchange of the LLC interest was facilitated for the purpose of the Companys pursuit of future acquisitions and/or mergers with other public and/or private entities that would expand its opportunities to create value for the Companys shareholders. The 1,000,000 shares were cancelled.

On November 22, 2016, Continental Rail Corp. filed a Certificate of Amendment pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) sections 78.385 and 78.390 and a Certificate of Change pursuant to NRS 78.0295 with the Nevada Secretary of State. The Certificate of Amendment provided for a change in the Companys name from Continental Rail Corp. to MediXall Group, Inc. to reflect a change in our business model to a Healthcare Incubator of development-stage healthcare technology companies. The Certificate of Change provided for a 1 for 15 reverse stock split of the Companys issued and outstanding common stock, reducing the number of common shares outstanding from 38,921,911 to 2,595,379 of which approximately 85% was controlled by related parties. No preferred shares were outstanding at the time of the Merger discussed below.

On December 13, 2016 the Company, completed a Share Exchange Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the Merger) with IHL of Florida, Inc., a Florida corporation (IHL) established in April, 2016 and under common control with the Company. Pursuant to the Merger, IHL shareholders transferred to the Company all their issued and outstanding shares of capital stock. In exchange, the Company agreed to issue 41,131,000 shares of common stock to IHL shareholders, including 18,599,750 shares issued to common control parties and 264,894 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, all issued to common control parties, and convertible into 24,900,000 shares of common stock. The share issuances represent approximately 94.1% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company post-closing. As a result, the Company (i) became the 100% parent of IHL; (ii) assumed the operations of IHL; and (iii) changed its name from Continental Rail Corp. to MediXall Group, Inc. 

Due to the common control of IHL and the Company, pursuant to ASC 805-50-25, Transactions Between Entities Under Common Control and other SEC guidance including for lack of economic substance, the Merger was accounted for as a transfer of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities under the predecessor value method of accounting. Financial statement presentation under the predecessor values method of accounting as a result of a business combination between entities under common control requires the receiving entity (i.e., the Company) to report the results of operations as if both entities had always been combined. The consolidated financial statements include both entities full results since the inception of IHL in April, 2016.

Prior to the Merger, On July 8, 2016, IHL entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with MediXall, Inc., a Florida corporation founded in November 2015. MediXall, Inc is a technology and innovative-driven organization purposefully designed and structured to bring effective change to the healthcare industry by improving healthcare and reducing costs. The Company currently has the rights to use 13 patents and 18 pending patents related to healthcare technologies licensed by The Quantum Group, Inc., (a privately-held Florida corporation), an incubator of companies that design, develop and deploy innovative solutions, technology, products, and services to the healthcare industry. MediXall, Inc. had no material operations prior to the Share Exchange which resulted in the acquisition of $2,200 of debt and no assets or revenue generating activities.

Business Overview
 
We are an Incubator of development-stage healthcare technology companies. Our mission is to revolutionize the medical industry by improving communication; providing better technology and support services; and enabling more efficient, cost-effective healthcare for the consumer.

Through licensing agreements, we have created the MediXaid Platform (the MediXaid Platform), which has developed a region by region medical services and products e-Marketplace to allow purchasers of products and services, including but not limited to consumers, insurance companies, self-insured employers, at-risk providers (such as Accountable Care Organizations) and others, to solicit bids from vendors including diagnostic companies and product providers based on location, quality, customer satisfaction results and best value. This regional medical/healthcare e-marketplace will allow patients to confidentially (using coded profiles and encrypted member identification) solicit for the MRI services (and all other services and products) within a given radius of their location. The MediXaid Platform will have multiple providers for all services, reversed bidding for the product or service and a variety of conditions that may be selected by patients such as location, delivery time and insurance network affiliation to be bid on by the provider based on their cost structure, immediate capacity, availability and ability to meet the patients selections.
 
Market Analysis

U.S. government reports confirm that healthcare spending in the United States continues to grow at a multiple of current inflation and by nearly five times the growth in GDP for the comparable period. At the current rate of growth, healthcare costs are predicted to grow to $4.7 trillion by 2021. At that point, healthcare spending will account for nearly 20 percent of our forecast GDP as compared to approximately 17% in 2014. 

In a National Health Expenditures Projections report, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimated that the average annual healthcare spending in the United States is projected to outpace the average annual growth in the overall economy by 2 to 3 percentage points per year. The projected principal drivers for this growth include continued cost-increasing medical innovation, inflation, continued demand for prescription drugs and the aging baby boomer demographic.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We know of no other company in the medical exchange marketplace that is prepared to offer the full range of medical equipment, medical devices, products and services credentialed in accordance with healthcare industry standards. The competitors of MediXaid are the online look-up medical equipment and device brokers. They offer no other assistance to the consumer/patient other than to display selected items and prices at various locations for consumer/patient purchase. These competitors are essentially recast Angies List, eBay or Thumbtack type of sites and provide no information 

The business model adopted by MediXaid includes the credentialing of all providers on the platform, real-time validation of consumer/patient health insurance, a robust payment system for consumer/patient payment to the provider, a scheduling system for setting appointments for services and the bidding portal for the providers. These elements, unique to MediXaid constitute an extremely high barrier of entry to anyone desiring to be competitive with MediXaid. 

Competitors

Subject to financing, we believe that we should be able to introduce our product to the marketplace by the fourth quarter of 2017.

Based on our experience and market analysis, there are various potential competitors that are providing online sales of medical equipment and durable medical devices; however, we have found no other company in the niche that MediXaid is creating. The following companies could modify their business model and compete with MediXaid in the future: 

McKesson, Inc.®  a public corporation trading as MCK in the NYSE and currently ranked 15th on the Fortune 500, delivers pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and healthcare information technology. At intersection with MediXaid the company provides a wide-range of medical devices and supplies for healthcare providers, including physicians and hospitals. The company also provides durable medical equipment for home healthcare to long-term care and home healthcare agencies; however, they do not provide access to physician or provider services.

Amerisourcebergen Corporation® - a public corporation trading as ABC on the NYSE and currently ranked 16th on the Fortune 500, distributes generic, branded and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, as well as some medical supplies and other products, using its network of more than two dozen facilities. A specialty distribution unit focuses on sensitive and complex biopharmaceuticals and other operations that includes pharmaceutical packaging.
Cardinal Health Inc.® - a public corporation trading as CAH on the NYSE and currently ranked 26th on the Fortune 500, a top distributor of pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies and equipment in the US. Its medical division parcels out medical, laboratory and surgical supplies and provides logistics, consulting and data management. Customers include retail pharmacies, hospitals, nursing homes, doctor's offices and other health care businesses. International markets for Cardinal Health include China.

Based upon our competitor analysis to date the large corporations are well positioned to deliver medical equipment, products and durable medical devices to physicians, hospitals, pharmacies and healthcare services businesses. We believe that there is no company positioned to address the growing shift in healthcare toward the individual patient/consumer. 

MediXaid has recognized this growing shift toward a patient-centric control of their own wellness and has designed the MediXaid platform to open a new vista of opportunity for the patient/consumer to not just manage their own wellness but potentially reduce their total out of pocket expenditures in this era of growing deductibles and healthcare costs. 
 
Our Business Strategy
 
The US healthcare industry in 2014 had passed the $3.2 trillion (USD) in annual expenditures consuming over 17% of GDP. Healthcare expenditures have been growing at a higher rate than inflation over the last 50 years, and only recently has this trend slowed. We believe that contrary to media reports the slowdown is part of the aftermath of the great recession of 2008 and 2009 and only with stubbornly high unemployment and corresponding underemployment has this trend line suspended. We believe this trend will prove short-lived and the long-term trend lines will be reestablished in 2017 for four primary reasons:

·
 The headwinds of economic contraction of unemployment will diminish.

·
 The function of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2009 has and will bring millions of new insured patients to the traditional marketplace, many of which have not had the benefits of continuous medical care, preventative care or access to full-service ancillary and diagnostic care.

·
 The continuing aging of 77 million baby boomers that are reaching 65 at a rate of 10,000 per day, a long term master trend that will have an impact on every segment of health care going forward.

·
 Gen-Y with 76 million in population are now shopping for healthcare and expect this type of technology to be readily available. This generation is already accustomed to finding everything via a computer or smart phone. They will be the ones who go into sticker shock when they start finding out how expensive healthcare really is. We expect this to create a dependency on our platform for generations to come.

The Problem:

Technology is transforming every industry in the US with the exception of healthcare and education. We believe that a tipping point has been reached and healthcare is currently experiencing an inflection point. The use of the Internet has transformed everything from buying a book, arranging a vacation, purchasing services for the home, buying a TV, a car and even a home. Today, consumers believe they can buy nearly anything online or get the best and highest value by checking online.

The Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, as it is sometimes referred to, has begun to change the way we buy insurance and interact with our government. For all the shortcomings of the much-publicized www.healthcare.gov website, it has pushed industry past the line in the sand and is forcing healthcare into the technology era with the rest of industry. It is our contention that the US government mandate that Providers use Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and cash incentives for Providers of over $35 billion in government grants has changed the healthcare industry forever. 

As the planned changes in ACA have been phased in the result has been skyrocketing premiums and unaffordable deductibles. "Deductibles have been going up so much faster than wages, almost seven times faster than wages," said Drew Altman, president and CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation. "When out-of-pocket costs are going up at a time when wages are flat, the pain level is still pretty high." He said higher deductibles are particularly difficult for people with chronic illnesses. "They may not get the health care they need if they have a very high deductible.1" We believe that demand for ancillary and support products and services as a bridge between normal primary care needs will be higher than ever. 

Cara Calvin, benefits manager at Alcott HR, a provider of human resources outsourcing solutions in Farmingdale, N.Y. stated, researching or shopping around for different facilities for procedures and services can result in lower costs to the employee, the insurance carrier and eventually the employer.2 In particular, large employers who self-insure can benefit from shopping their health care services and reducing their healthcare costs which creates an incentive for both employee and employer to use the MediXaid platform.

Example:

A patient with a $5,000 annual deductible plan has just been told by a doctor that in order to rule out a possible medical condition, or to confirm a condition, it is indicated that the patient receive an MRI with contrast of the head. 

From experience we know that the doctor will likely call a provider that they consider to be their favorite to pursue these MRI services, and the MRI services will contact the health plan of the consumer to obtain the information necessary to obtain proper authorization, determine benefits as well as co-pays and deductibles of the health plan and advise the patient/member of the list of approved ancillary providers. With a high deductible plan, it is very likely that the patient will be responsible for the entire or substantially all the cost of the procedure, and yet the patient was NOT involved in the securing of the best price or value.

This process has been the same for decades.

Generally, the health plan has negotiated a contract with a given provider in its network that pre-determines both cost, as well as the patient's co-pay, or remaining deductible amount, consistent with their health plan benefits. The patient does not pick generally the MRI Provider, and has little knowledge of the cost. Until recently it had been assumed by the industry experts that the health plan had the best network AND had negotiated the best prices; yet, market conditions have changed and our management experience confirms this assumption is not always true, in fact it is seldom true. This is due in part to both lack of transparency and the ability to have dynamic pricing. Our experience further tells us that the same contrast MRI cost can range between $400 and $3,000, depending on a number of situational conditions. Our goal is to make the process confidential, more effective and financially more transparent.
Our Solution:

We propose creating a region by region medical and healthcare-related electronic marketplace to allow purchasers of related goods, services and products, including but not limited to consumers, insurance companies, self-insured employers, at-risk providers (such as Accountable Care Organizations) and others, to solicit bids from vendors including diagnostic companies and product providers based on location, quality, customer satisfaction results and best value. 

This regional medical/healthcare marketplace will allow patients to confidentially (using encoded and encrypted profiles to protect their identity until a purchase is made) solicit for the MRI services (and all other services and products) within a given radius of their location. It will have multiple providers for all services, reversed bidding for the product or service based on cost structure and availability. 

In our example, a patient may be willing to do an MRI if the cost was lower on an evening or even a weekend to pay less, or may be willing to pay slightly more to receive the MRI the same day. The benefit to providers is self-evident, access to a patient that they may not have had any access to, and higher equipment utilization through higher volume. It also allows an MRI provider to price to the market based on the volume they are seeing.

At present, the only way to find and secure a healthcare appointment is to call around. This process is time consuming and outdated. Our unique patient/consumer focused electronic healthcare marketplace will empower instant availability and pricing at internet speeds.

In addition to MediXaid, MediXall is in active negotiations to acquire, invest and incubate other operating and startup companies that collectively align with our vision. These companies are in the market of electronic health information; diagnostics; medical practice management; medical billing and collections; care management; and, synergistic information technologies. While some of these potential acquisitions are in the design stage, others are in pre-revenue operations or fully operational, generating revenue from $1,000,000 to $4,000,000 annually. 

In the short term, all of our current projects and companies have exclusive operation in South Florida; however, subject to financing rapid national expansion is anticipated through additional investments and/or acquisitions in the latter part of 2017. 

Sales 
 
As opposed to a delayed revenue business model, each of MediXalls investments is acquired with the intention of generating revenue in the near term. 

The MediXaid Platform will generate revenue through provider/vendor membership fees, credentialing fees and transaction fees. These costs will be nominal for providers/vendors but will provide material margins for the company allowing us to initially provide the platform to the public marketplace at no charge to the consumer. 
Intellectual Property
 
The Quantum Group, Inc. (QGP) has licensed its patents, both issued and in pending status, to MediXall for the exclusive purpose of establishing a medical exchange and developing medical and healthcare technologies consistent with the Mission of MediXall. Additional patent applications are being filed by QGP in areas that could benefit MediXall. QGP has developed and is bringing to market a revolutionary Electronic Health Record (EHR) platform called PWeR® for Personal Wellness electronic Record® that is envisioned to eventually utilize the MediXaid Marketplace Platform through its unique Patient Portal to provide an entirely new and robust experience for both the patient and provider in identifying and obtaining needed medical-related patient care.

The 13 patents granted and the more than 18 pending patents created by QGP contain more than 800 patent claims that QGP is perfecting. Only a few EMR/EHR companies have patents in this space and we are confident that no other company has a portfolio that reaches the breadth and depth of the QGP patents. A review of the patents clearly establishes that the use of one or more of the patents could be beneficial to both companies. 

QGP has exclusively assigned and licensed to MediXall all of its pending and issued patents and intellectual property related to and for use exclusively in areas of common interest such as the building of the healthcare exchange. In consideration for the license to its patents Quantum has recieved a non-dilutable interest in MediXall Group, Inc.; payment of perpetual licensing fees; and access to other healthcare-related patents controlled by The Quantum Group, Inc. The basis of the MediXaid concept is based on a patent application filed by QGP on November 9, 2007 and published as US 2009/0125325 A1 on May 14, 2009. This patent was by design very broad and not issued because it was not considered a new innovation and appeared like other exchanges; however, MediXall and QGP management believes material opportunity remains for this concept.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016 we employed 4 full-time employees.
