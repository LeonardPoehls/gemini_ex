 Industry Overview and Market Opportunity 
 People and businesses have unparalleled access to content. News, blogs, social media, photos, mobile messaging, videos, movies and television shows are consumed across a growing number of devices as screens and Internet connectivity are ubiquitous. As digital has become the primary method of media consumption for consumers, creative professionalsincluding brand managers, agencies and other marketing professionalshave changed the way they create, distribute and display content across an increasingly diverse device ecosystem in order to influence consumer behavior. Creative professionals need an abundance of content, delivered seamlessly across device platforms, that is engaging, on brand, and relevant to the consumer. For device manufacturers, the challenge is allowing users to consume content with the look-and-feel the author intended. In all of these environments, consumers are seeking opportunities for creative self-expression through social media interactions and messaging. In each case, the goal is to provide an engaging user experience and a platform for self-expression. 
 Overarching themes in these markets include: 
 

 | Mobile is the dominant platform. The majority of global Internet devices are now smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices provide convenient and ubiquitous connectivity. Consumer reliance on traditional personal computers for communication, computing and accessing content is declining rapidly. This migration is changing consumer behavior. While television remains a significant source for media, in the U.S. the percent of time spent and the percent of advertising spending on traditional television media is in decline. In the U.S., mobile is the only platform for media consumption that has shown an increase in share over the last five years, according to Kleiner Perkins partner Mary Meekers 2016 Internet Trends report. This pattern is particularly evident among consumers younger than 35.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The value of a device comes from its being part of an ecosystem. Manufacturers of consumer electronics as well as other connected devices (e.g. cars, appliances and Internet-of-Things devices) are building products that connect to each other and to the cloud in order to accelerate product innovation and extend the capabilities of these devices. In addition, consumers use their connected devices as platforms for consuming content and communicating with other consumers and devices.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A brands relationship with customers is changing. Consumers want to participate actively with brands that they perceive as aligning with their lifestyles and values. Consumers increasingly view poorly-targeted content as a distraction or an intrusion. The desire to interact with specific brands transforms consumers into brand advocates when communication and targeting are done effectively. As advocates, these consumers provide content back to the brands that acts as an authentic voice for brand values; this is often referred to as earned content. For generations such as millennials, purchases driven by brand endorsement are increasingly social, giving rise to social media and messaging platforms as dominant media and consumption channels.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | Data and analytics are core to the connected world. Effective content targeting requires a thorough understanding of users and their behavior. Marketers, product developers and media providers all need to draw insights from consumer data that can be incorporated into actions that build consumer loyalty and foster ongoing interactions between the brand and its consumers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our customers turn to us for comprehensive, powerful and easy-to-use solutions based on our design assets, technology and expertise, which address the needs of our customers whether they are content creators, marketers, consumer device manufacturers, or independent software vendors and developers. These customers use our products to enhance user experiences, create compelling digital and print content, and provide platforms for using content to engage their best customers as brand advocates. 
 Content Creators 
 Content creators include brands, advertising agencies, graphic designers, printers, publishers, and non-professional creators of content (such as social media users, designers, bloggers and self-publishers). Content creators produce digital and/or printed material, and they seek creative ways to convey meaning and differentiate identity. Fonts are an important tool for this differentiation. For example, creative professionals at multinational corporations are increasingly tasked with creating solutions that extend their brand into new markets. The challenge is to ensure that branding efforts are reflected consistently in every communication, regardless of media. In addition, creative professionals need design tools that integrate seamlessly into their workflows, making them more efficient. Web fonts, which travel with the content to a users connected device for consistent viewing regardless of the environment, are an example of a solution that addresses the needs of creative professional customers. Social media and messaging platforms offer a wide range of opportunities for consumers (non-professional creatives) to express a personal brand. Stickers, emoji and fonts allow consumers to communicate who they are in fun and expressive ways and, when their use is monitored and reported, also provide analytics back to the brand. 
Marketers 
 Marketers are facing new challenges. Traditional media channels for reaching consumers, such as broadcast television, are losing their audience. A proliferation of digital media channels for consuming content has forced marketers to reshape their strategies to better serve a mobile-first, multi-screen marketing landscape. The content is on-demand and has a heavy social component through which consumers interact with the content. Marketers need to participate in these channels without being viewed as intrusive or inauthentic. Two positive aspects of the changing landscape are that consumers are actively seeking to align with brands they view as reflecting their values and that these media platforms (including social and messaging platforms) offer more direct data on their users and their interaction with the content. Marketers now have an opportunity to make their best customers advocates of the brand. The content that these users create (broadly defined in the industry as user-generated content or UGC) allows consumers to provide an authentic voice for promoting brands, since the brand earns it through customer loyalty rather than paying for it. Similarly, marketers have the opportunity to provide branded content to these customers who want to show their support. With the right technology platforms, marketers can measure these interactions and refine their programs to optimize the return on their marketing expenses.

Consumer Device Manufacturers 
 Consumer devices are platforms for consuming content. These devices require robust multimedia functionality, as consumers create and share videos, animations and other rich-media and interactive content across various mobile devices. Consumer device manufacturers must display multimedia content, including text, from these different sources, while providing a consistent look-and-feel across devices, supporting worldwide languages and, in many cases, supporting enhanced personalization. As technologies enable media to move seamlessly from one device to another, scalable, multilingual type and related display solutions that are optimized for these devices are critical. For example: 

 | The automotive industry uses digital displays with complex, worldwide language requirements. In addition, the industry is becoming more aware of legibility as a factor in helping to reduce driver distraction.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Digital TVs incorporate scalable text for menu navigation, content delivery and connectivity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Rich media functionality has moved to mobile platforms, driving the adoption of scalable text on phones, tablets and similar devices.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Appliance manufacturers worldwide are adding Internet connectivity and control panels with enhanced graphical user interfaces to improve the user experience and to provide consumers with additional control and functionality.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The market for laser printers and digital copiers is more mature than the rest of the consumer device market. As a result, the least expensive end of the market is becoming more commoditized. Laser printer manufacturers are responding by increasing the functionality of their products with advances such as a larger number of embedded fonts, enhanced control panel functionality, and creating new printing paradigms and services offerings, including mobile printing and managed print services. Comprehensive global text solutions and related technologies continue to be an important part of printing platforms. 
 Independent Software Vendors and Developers 
 Similar to consumer devices, software solutions and cloud services are marketed globally. For example, ISVs require multilingual text solutions for product user interfaces as well as a range of type to add functionality to applications. Mobile device game developers want a distinctive and consistent typeface for their games, especially when the game is designed to run on multiple devices and consoles. In addition, developers want to customize their offerings with fonts specific to their vertical market or geographic regions. 
 ISVs and platform developers are increasingly distributing their solutions through software-as-a-service, cloud-based models and to multiple devices including PCs, mobile phones, game consoles, tablets and other devices. As a result, developers require font technologies that allow products to maintain a consistent, high-quality user experience regardless of the delivery model and device and its screen resolution. 
Our Products 
 We provide high-quality creative assets and technology solutions to marketers and content creators that empower our customers to achieve global brand fidelity and drive consistent user experiences across a wide variety of devices and online media. These creative assets and user experiences now extend to new forms of engagement through consumer

 interactions that allow marketers to broaden a brands reach, while maintaining design fidelity. We also provide underlying technology solutions to enable those same global brand fidelity and user experiences via device screens or printers.

Competitive Strengths 
 We are a leading global provider of design assets, technology and expertise that are designed to enable the best user experiences and ensure brand integrity. Our core strengths include: 
 Type. Our Monotype Libraries, comprised of the Monotype, Linotype, ITC, Ascender, FontFont and Bitstream type collections, are some of the worlds best known inventories of type. Our selection is continuously expanding, adding even more fonts from some of the worlds best type designers.

Our hinting and rendering technologies for consumer devices ensure high-quality display on any screen, regardless of text size or language used. Our solutions for printer manufacturers ensure high-quality output and flexibility to meet specific requirements. 
 Technological and Intellectual Property Leadership. Our technologies are key to providing unique, flexible and comprehensive solutions for content creation, distribution and consumption, and we continue to invest in extending our technology and market leadership positions. For example, we offer web fonts that are hand-hinted by experts to deliver a high-quality experience on the web. Our Monotype Spark solution draws from our iType and WorldType Layout solutions to bring high-quality text rendering to low-memory devices, enabling devices such as wearables to improve their user interfaces. The flexibility of our offerings enables us to provide tailored, comprehensive solutions, like the Monotype Portfolio for Automotive, which brings type, technology and expert consultation to the automotive industry. In addition, we expanded our technology offering with the acquisition of Olapic on August 9, 2016. Olapics technology platform for gathering, moderating, distributing and measuring user-generated content and other types of branded content, when combined with our traditional offerings, provides our customers a unique solution for designing content and using that content for marketing purposes. 
 Expertise, Experienced Leadership and Employee Base. Our expertise in font design and engineering gives us a strong foundation to meet the challenges of todays consumer environments. We are home to some of the worlds top type designers who provide expert consultation and custom design services to help customers articulate their distinctive brand values. Our experts work closely with customers to achieve goals like developing successful brand identities, expanding brands into global markets and managing the consistent use of a brand across an organization. Our employee base includes some of the worlds most experienced professionals who intimately understand typefaces and software. Additionally, 
 
9 
 
 with the acquisitions of Swyft Media and Olapic, we have added deep domain expertise in messaging solutions and visual content marketing solutions, respectively. 
 Established Relationships with Market Leaders. Several of our customer relationships date back 25 years or more. Our OEM customers are many of the largest and most successful companies in each of the markets they serve. In the consumer device space, we provide solutions to market leaders like Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. In the laser printer market, our customers include eight of the top ten laser printer manufacturers based on the volume of units shipped worldwide. Our Creative Professional customers include major international media, publishing and marketing solutions companies, such as Hearst Magazines and Pearson, as well as other large publishers and major design firms. 
 Broad Application of IP and Solutions Among Worlds Largest Organizations. Our design assets, technology, and expertise serve varying needs within a diverse organization. Our rich, multi-language font IP and embedded font technology are crucial to our OEM customers who manufacture high-volume consumer devices that have multimedia functionality and multinational distribution. That same font IP is used to build a brands identity (at a corporate or product level). Our UGC technology enables brands to extract highly authentic content from users on social media platforms at scale which can be used in marketing programs to better connect with intended audiences and improve marketing outcomes. Our mobile messaging IP and technology is vital to those marketers looking to cultivate meaningful engagement with brand enthusiasts across the worlds leading messaging platforms. 
 Global and Multi-Channel Presence. Our customers are located throughout the world. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, 43.8%, 45.5% and 47.6% of our revenue, respectively, was derived from sales by our operating subsidiaries located in the United Kingdom, Germany, China and Japan. With our enterprise sales associates covering North America, LATAM, EMEA, and APAC coupled with our websites, including myfonts.com, fonts.com, fontshop.com and linotype.com, we provide a footprint and sales channel designed to fit any customers needs. We support all of the worlds major languages and have specifically designed our solutions for displaying rich content in Asian and other non-Latin languages. We enable OEM customers to engineer a common platform supporting multiple languages, reducing costs and time to market, and increasing product flexibility. China, Japan and Korea are increasingly becoming centers of design, manufacturing and consumers of consumer devices, and we have more than 25 years of experience partnering with leading Asian companies such as Ricoh, Samsung, Toshiba and Kyocera Mita. 
 Attractive Business Model. We have a significant, predictable base of licensing revenue that is based, in part, on multi-year financial commitments by our customers, mainly due to our established relationships with OEMs and quarterly royalty reports we receive from them, the high volume of web transactions and growing recurring direct business. Other revenue contracts have renewable term licenses, and in Creative Professional, our web font service is primarily a subscription-based model, providing a recurring stream of revenue. In addition, the high volume of low-dollar web transactions runs at a predictable rate, which together lends to an overall recurring and predictable revenue base of over approximately 85% of our total revenue. As a technology licensing business, we generate significant cash flows from incremental OEM revenue. We have a relatively low cash tax rate which increases our cash flows, due primarily to the tax deductibility of goodwill associated with our U.S. and German subsidiaries.

Our Strategy 
 Monotype empowers expression and engagement for creatives, designers, marketers and engineers who have two primary intentions: 
 

 | Produce compelling brand experiences that will resonate with a targeted audience; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Cultivate a relationship with that audience by engaging with brand enthusiasts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our strategy is to make these design and marketing activities more effective and efficient for our customers. For those designing content or user experiences, our strategy begins with our rich heritage of the worlds most iconic typefaces, which form the foundation of the best designs. We also provide complimentary design elements and content, including user-generated content, as well as services for creating branded emojis, to major global brands and individual designers who seek innovative ways to express a brand message. In addition, we offer technology that allows efficient discovery, curation and publishing of this content. 
 For marketers who seek to use this content to communicate with their best customers, our strategy is to enable distribution of branded user experiences to attract, acquire and engage their customers. The goal is to provide earned contentcontent that is generated and shared by brand enthusiaststhat resonates with these customers through an authentic representation of the brand. The best of these customers become advocates and promoters for the brand with their own voice (and content). These interactions are intended to drive further customer action such as a revenue transaction or brand evangelism. Marketers cultivate a meaningful relationship with brand enthusiasts to generate earned, authentic content while the measurement of earned content helps marketers improve ecommerce merchandising, increase performance by optimizing creative decisions, and connect and reward their most valuable followers. 
 From creating compelling brand experiences to cultivating engaging relationships between brands and their best customers, we strive to be the first place to turn for the design assets, technology and expertise that empower brand engagement, self-expression and the best user experiences. Following are the key components of our strategy: 
 Creative Professional 
 Empower the Creative Process. Our focus is to help designers and other creative professionals succeed as workflows and publishing environments become more complex. Our customers are creating content that is distributed through a broad range of publishing environments, including the web, mobile devices, applications, as well as print. We provide a comprehensive selection of typeface designs, custom typefaces, worldwide language support and fonts that are tuned to display in the highest quality, regardless of the output medium. Our licensing options provide flexible coverage to meet our customers evolving requirements. A key component of our strategy is offering simplified, flexible subscriptions to large portions of our font library with the goal of making it easier for creative professionals to access and use any font. 
 Our customers creative needs are not limited to fonts. Just as distribution environments have grown in complexity, so too have the forms of content to which consumers respond. Consumers find content that they view as authentic (as opposed to staged) as more attractive. To that end, our strategy includes offering design assets and other types of content that meet this requirement. User-generated content, which reflects consumers interpretation of the 
 
11 
 
 brand, and branded assets such as emoji, which allow consumers to express themselves using a brands imagery, are examples of how Monotype is expanding its offering to meet these broader creative requirements. 
 Cultivate Meaningful Digital Engagement. Our strategy now extends beyond the creation of content to marketers use of this content to communicate with their best customers. Monotype enables distribution of branded user experiences to attract, acquire and engage our customers consumers. The goal is to provide content that resonates with these consumers through an authentic representation of the brand. With the acquisition of Olapic, we offer a platform for gathering and moderating user-generated content. The platform allows brands to make user-generated content actionable and then to measure response rates to determine what designs are most effective, which contributors offer the best content and what programs are most successful. 
 In addition, mobile messaging apps, photo sharing apps and other social platforms have become the backbone for communicating in todays world, especially among younger consumers. In these environments, consumers are eager to personalize their text messages and their posts with branded content such as digital stickers and emoji. Swyft Medias mobile engagement platform provides value to stakeholders across the mobile messaging ecosystem and provides access to many of the top messaging applications platforms through partnerships, including with Viber, Kik and Kakao Talk. Brands and advertisers are able to reach consumers through branded, monetizable content that is integrated within the social experience. In addition, consumers are able to take advantage of shareable, branded content such as digital stickers and emoji to express themselves. 
 OEM 
 Display Imaging 
 Increase Penetration of our Technologies and Fonts into a Wide Range of Device Categories. Our technologies and fonts play an important role in the mass-market success of device categories such as automotive displays, smart TVs, wearables, mobile devices and e-book readers and tablets. We have an established base of customers in these categories, and we will seek to expand within existing accounts as new models are added, or as new product lines are introduced. We intend to continue to pursue new design wins such as next-generation in-vehicle displays, helping customers to meet key requirements including brand integrity, high legibility and worldwide language support. We also seek to expand our value proposition to device manufacturers by providing a more holistic solution that serves both product experience and branding needs. Our offering is an important component of the user experience on consumer devices. Yet the user experience is only one manifestation of a manufacturers brand communication. As an example, a mobile smartphone manufacturer utilizes our font IP and embedded technology to optimize the user experience of the device. That same manufacturer uses our font IP, messaging IP, and UGC technology to develop a brands identity and influence purchase decisions of its target audience in leading channels. Our strategy includes introducing a licensing model that meets not only the device-side needs of device engineers but also the design and marketing needs of creative professionals within these large organizations. 
Printer Imaging 
 Leverage Our Long-Term Relationships. We constantly strive to strengthen our long-term relationships by working closely with OEMs to fulfill evolving requirements, such as 
 
12 
 
 providing value-added solutions that differentiate offerings, reduce cost, or capitalize on new technology paradigms. For example, we offer printer manufacturers flexible, high-performance printer driver tool kits that support popular operating systems. OEMs are able to integrate and customize robust printing capabilities to gain a competitive edge. Our flexible architecture, support for multiple print languages and extensive use of common code enables printer manufacturers to speed products to market while reducing development time and costs. Using our solution to support multiple page description languages, in combination with our fonts and drivers, provides a more complete offering. In addition, we offer licensing models that make deploying our fonts and technologies broadly within a printer manufacturers offering easy for the long term. 
Independent Software Vendors and Developers 
 Expand Support of ISVs to All Deployment Environments. Our core offering to ISVs and developers consists of providing fonts, custom typefaces and rendering technologies for language coverage, platform compatibility, user experience enhancement and creative expression. Options for accessing and deploying our software and applications have expanded from on-device to secure cloud-based services and combinations of the two. Our ISV strategy is to license our fonts and tools to provide the flexibility ISVs need to create compelling offerings for devices like tablets, smartphones and medical devices. 
Overall, We Seek to: 
 Expand and Deepen our Global Presence. We intend to drive our revenue growth by leveraging our knowledge of global markets and through our global operations. Our strategy focuses on countries and regions where our target Creative Professional and OEM customers and prospects are concentrated. Our approach includes expanding our presence in key countries and developing a direct or indirect presence in countries that we evaluate as having strong potential for growth. Through this organic expansion and possible acquisitions, we intend to increase our ability to service consumer device manufacturers and creative professionals throughout the world. 
 Selectively Pursue Complementary Acquisitions, Strategic Partnerships and Third-Party Intellectual Property. We intend to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions, strategic partnerships and third-party intellectual property to accelerate our time to market with complementary solutions, penetrate new geographies and enhance our intellectual property portfolio. We believe that the market for our solutions is still fragmented. We have a demonstrated track record of identifying, acquiring and integrating companies that enhance our intellectual property portfolio. Our acquisition on August 9, 2016 of Olapic, Inc., a privately-held earned content platform company, has diversified and expanded our offering. Our acquisition of Swyft Media Inc. (formerly TextPride, Inc.) on January 30, 2015, a privately-held branded mobile content company, has helped us reach new customers, and continues to provide us with an opportunity to add value by including some of the worlds largest and most popular collections of fonts.

 We have a strong commitment to research and development for core technology programs directed at creating new products, product enhancements and new applications for existing products, as well as funding research into future market opportunities. Each of the markets we serve is generally characterized by rapid technological change and product innovation. We believe that continued timely development of new products and product enhancements to serve existing and new markets is necessary to remain competitive.

Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of copyright, patent and trademark laws and on contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our technologies and fonts. Whenever possible, we enter into non-disclosure agreements with our suppliers, partners and others to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. 
 We apply for U.S. and international patents with respect to our technologies, and seek copyright registration of our software and U.S. and international trademark registration in those instances which we determine are competitively advantageous and cost effective to do so. We have been granted a total of 19 patents and have 28 patents pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office with many also filed in foreign jurisdictions. Some of our most important patents are related to our dynamic subsetting, font compression and machine learning technologies. We have unregistered trademarks and, where appropriate, registered trademarks on the key fonts in our Monotype Libraries. We intend to continue our policy of taking all measures we deem necessary to protect our patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark rights. 
 Some of our fonts are owned by third parties that we license under exclusive or non-exclusive agreements. We have also collaborated with third parties in the production and development of fonts. 
 Competition 
 Our solutions compete with those offered by a variety of companies, including vendors of print and screen imaging technologies, printer drivers and design tools, as well as designers and distributors of fonts. We compete principally on the basis of our technical innovation, engineering and customer support expertise, the breadth of our font offerings and the overall performance of our solutions, including reliability and timely delivery. Competition with our solutions comes from a variety of sources, including companies that license technologies and fonts, such as Adobe, and local providers of solutions that are specific to a particular countrys language requirements, such as Morisawa in Japan. We also compete with open source fonts and technologies, including the FreeType text renderer, a product of an open source collaborative organization that provides its Linux font rendering code for free, and Google, which provides open source fonts. In addition, we compete with several small players in the emergent space of brand engagement such as, but not limited to, Bazaarvoice, Curalate, Bitstrips and Snaps. The competition for our custom font design services generally comes from companies offering their own type libraries and custom type services, including boutique font foundries and independent professionals. We also compete with in-house resources of our OEM customers.
