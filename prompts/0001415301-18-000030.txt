Item 1.    Business
We were initially organized as a Delaware limited liability company on June 30, 2006 in connection with the acquisition by our former principal stockholder of Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon, Inc., which owned the Del Frisco’s and Sullivan’s restaurant concepts. Following the acquisition, the company was restructured to separate certain other Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon concepts by, among other things, spinning off the subsidiaries that owned and operated those concepts. We converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation in July 2012 in connection with our initial public offering. Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to “we,” “our,” “us,” or the “Company” refer to Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Our Company
We develop, own and operate three contemporary, high-end, complementary restaurants: Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse, or the Double Eagle, Del Frisco’s Grille, or the Grille, and Sullivan’s Steakhouse, or Sullivan’s. We are a leader in the full-service steakhouse industry based on average unit volume ("AUV"), and EBITDA margin. We currently operate 53 restaurants in 23 states and the District of Columbia. Each of our three restaurant concepts offers steaks as well as other menu selections, such as chops and fresh seafood. These menu selections are complemented by an extensive, award-winning wine list. The Double Eagle, Grille and Sullivan’s are positioned within the fine dining segment and are designed to appeal to both business and local dining customers. Our Double Eagle restaurants are sited in urban locations to target customers seeking a “destination dining” experience while our Grille and Sullivan’s restaurants are intended to appeal to a broader demographic, allowing them to be located either in urban areas or in close proximity to affluent residential neighborhoods. We believe our success reflects consistent execution across all aspects of the dining experience, from the formulation of proprietary recipes to the procurement and presentation of high quality menu items and delivery of a positive customer experience.
Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse
We believe the Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse is one of the premier steakhouse concepts in the United States. The Del Frisco’s Double Eagle brand is defined by its menu, which includes USDA Prime grade, wet-aged and dry-aged steaks hand-cut at the time of order and a range of other high-quality offerings, including prime dry-aged lamb, fresh seafood, and signature side dishes and desserts. It is also distinguished by its “swarming service,” whereby customers are served simultaneously by multiple servers. Each restaurant has a sommelier to guide diners through an extensive, award-winning wine list and our bartenders specialize in hand-shaken martinis and crafted cocktails. Del Frisco’s Double Eagle restaurants target customers seeking a full-service, fine dining steakhouse experience. We believe the décor and ambiance, with both contemporary and classic designs, enhance our customers’ experience and differentiate Del Frisco’s Double Eagles from other upscale steakhouse concepts. We currently operate 13 Double Eagle steakhouses in nine states and the District of Columbia. These restaurants range in size from 11,000 to 24,000 square feet with seating capacity for at least 300 people. Additional Double Eagle openings are planned over the next year, and we anticipate they will range in size from 12,000 to 16,000 square feet. Annual AUVs per Double Eagle for locations open the entire year were $13.6 million for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2017. During the same period, the average check at these Double Eagle locations was $116.
Del Frisco’s Grille
We developed the Grille in 2011 to take advantage of the positioning of the Del Frisco’s brand and to provide greater potential for expansion due to its smaller size, lower build out cost and more diverse menu. The Grille is an upscale casual concept with a refreshing, modern menu that draws inspiration from bold flavors and fresh ingredients. It appeals broadly to both business and casual diners borrowing from the Del Frisco’s heritage with the same high quality Double Eagle prime aged steaks, top selling signature menu items and a broad selection of the same quality wines. In addition the Grille has an extensive menu creating new twists on American comfort classics including regional flavors and locally sourced ingredients. We believe the ambiance of the concept appeals to a wide range of customers seeking a less formal atmosphere for their dining occasions. Each Del Frisco’s Grille features a bar that is the centerpiece for a great night out. In 2017 we carried out an in depth Brand analysis with a leading third party consultant to assist us in better understanding growth opportunities and target guests. We currently operate 24 Grilles in 12 states and the District of Columbia. Additional Grille openings are planned over the next year, and we anticipate they will range in size from 6,500 to 8,000 square feet with seating capacity for at least 200 people. Annual AUVs per Grille restaurant for locations open the entire year were $4.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2017. During the same period, the average check at these Grille locations was $46.

Sullivan’s Steakhouse
Sullivan’s was created in the mid-1990’s as a complementary concept to Del Frisco’s. The Sullivan’s brand is defined by a fine dining experience at a more accessible price point, along with a vibrant atmosphere created by an open kitchen, live music and a bar area designed to be a center for social gathering and entertainment. Each Sullivan’s features fine hand-selected aged steaks, fresh seafood and a broad list of custom cocktails, along with an extensive selection of award-winning wines. We currently operate 16 Sullivan’s steakhouses in 13 states. These restaurants range in size from 7,000 to 11,000 square feet with seating capacity for at least 250 people. Annual AUVs per Sullivan’s restaurant were $3.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2017. During the same period, the average check at Sullivan’s was $65.
Site Selection and Development
We believe site selection is critical for the potential success of our restaurants. We have partnered with a third party master broker to source potential sites against a set of clear criteria for each Brand. We carefully consider growth opportunities for each of our restaurant concepts and utilize a customized approach for each concept when selecting and prioritizing markets for expansion. We perform comprehensive demographic and customer profile studies to evaluate and rationalize the trade areas and sites within each desired market. We leverage a significant number of sources to produce extensive research and analysis on the dynamics of the local area, the specific attributes of each site considered and the unit economics we believe we can realize. Our evaluation process also includes working with a third party spatial analytics company, which has developed a model to determine the most attractive locations for each of our Brands and a predictive sales model for specific sites. A Real Estate Committee, consisting of members of the Board and senior management visits, assesses and approves each site against a set of clear criteria.  
For the Double Eagle brand, we focus primarily on sites in urban locations that allow us to easily access business clientele and customers seeking a premium dining experience. Many of our Double Eagle restaurants are in marquee locations, including waterfront property, popular shopping districts and active business centers. For our Grille and Sullivan’s concepts, we target sites in high traffic urban and suburban locations in close proximity to affluent residential areas. Our site assessment analysis includes three primary components: customer profiling (demographics, lifestyle segmentation, spend metrics, clustering/density analysis), trade area and site evaluation (physical inspection, competitive benchmarking, analysis of business generators/traffic patterns), and financial modeling (square footage and seat count analysis, predictive sales analytics, margin evaluations, investment cost and return metrics). Understanding our customers is an essential element of our market planning and site selection processes. We have developed a customer profile model for each of our concepts to help guide our development efforts and educate our development partners. We look for the following minimum criteria in our site trade areas:
 | Population(a) | DaytimePopulation(a) | Average HHIncome | MedianAge | Priority AgeBlocks(b) | TrafficCounts(c)
﻿ | | | | | | 
 | 100,000+ | 150,000+ | $ | 100,000 | + | 40+ | 35-44; 45-54;55-64 | 40,000+

 | 75,000+ | 100,000+ | $ | 75,000 | + | 35+ | 35-44; 45-54 | 25,000+

(a)Represents the population within a customized target area generally with less than a 20-minute drive time.
(b)Represents the targeted age demographics for a prospective site.
(c)Represents the targeted average daily vehicle traffic for a prospective site.
We expect the size of new Double Eagle restaurants to range from 12,000 to 16,000 square feet, new Grille restaurants to range from 6,500 to 8,000 square feet and new Sullivan’s restaurants to range from 8,000 to 9,000 square feet. For the opening of a new restaurant, we measure our cash investment costs net of landlord contributions and equipment financing, but including pre-opening costs. We target average cash investment costs of $7.0 million to $9.0 million for a new Double Eagle and $3.5 million to $4.5 million for a new Grille or Sullivan’s. We target a cash-on-cash return of at least 30% beginning in the third operating year across our concepts with target restaurant-level EBITDA margins of between 25% and 35% for each of our three concepts.
We believe there are opportunities to open four to seven new restaurants annually, generally composed of three to four Double Eagles and one to three Grilles, with new openings of our Double Eagle concept likely serving as the primary driver of new 
2

unit growth in the near term. During the fiscal year ending on December 25, 2018, we expect to open three to four Double Eagles and two to three Grilles. It generally takes 9 to 12 months after the signing of a lease or the closing of a purchase to complete construction and open a new restaurant. Additional time is sometimes required to obtain certain government approvals, permits and licenses, such as liquor licenses.
Restaurant Operations and Management
Our restaurants have a distinctive combination of food, atmosphere and service in an upscale environment. We believe that our success reflects the consistency of our execution across all aspects of the dining experience, from the formulation of proprietary recipes, to the procurement and presentation of high quality menu items and the delivery of a positive customer experience. We strive to provide quality through a carefully controlled and established supply chain and proven preparation techniques.
Depending on the volume of each restaurant, our typical restaurant-level management team ranges from 4 to 10 people including one general manager, one executive chef and a team of assistant managers and sous chefs. We also have an experienced team of regional directors to oversee operations at multiple restaurants. To ensure that each restaurant and its employees meet our demanding performance requirements, we have developed a set of strict operational standards that are followed in all facets of our operations. For example, these standards are used to develop corporate recipes, many of which are proprietary, that are adhered to across all of our restaurants. These standards also mandate a quality control process for the menu items in each of our restaurants that our chefs and managers oversee before each shift. This quality control process includes the full preparation of each item on our menu, other than our steaks, and the testing of each of these items for presentation, taste, portion size and temperature before they are prepared for our customers. Items that do not meet our rigorous standards are re-made until they do. We believe this process of full preparation for testing differentiates us from our competition.
The consistent execution at our restaurants is a result of the extensive training and supervision of our employees. Our general managers are required to undergo eight to ten weeks of initial training in food quality, customer service, alcohol beverage service, liquor liability avoidance and employee retention programs. Each of our new hourly employees also typically participates in a training program during which the employee works under the close supervision of his or her general manager. Our chefs and their assistants receive extensive training in food quality, food supply management and kitchen maintenance. All of our employees are trained to uphold each concept’s distinct characteristics and our overall values and operating philosophy.
Our training programs are administered by the general manager at each restaurant and supervised by our chief people officer and a dedicated training director for each concept. This training team ensures that all new general managers have developed a comprehensive set of tools that they can use to manage their restaurant, including employee selection, performance management and wage and hourly compliance. We also require each general manager to obtain a mandatory internal certification in areas of the kitchen, dining room and bar area. Our training team also supports new restaurant openings. Each of our concepts have developed a streamlined training program that ensures employees opening a new restaurant function as a cohesive team and maintain our high operational and food preparation standards. As a result, our corporate and concept-level infrastructure supports our growth strategy, allowing us to successfully replicate our standards in new restaurants.
Sourcing and Supply Chain
Our ability to maintain the consistent quality of our restaurants depends in part on our ability to procure food and other supplies from reliable sources in accordance with the specifications for all food products established by our corporate executive chef. We continually research and evaluate products and supplies to ensure high quality meat, seafood and other menu ingredients. Our corporate executive chef and director of purchasing work with Stock Yards, a division of U.S. Foods, Inc., our primary beef supplier, as well as secondary beef suppliers, for all beef purchases on a national level. Our director of purchasing negotiates directly with suppliers of meat, seafood and certain other food and beverage products to ensure consistent quality and freshness and to obtain competitive prices for items purchased nationally for each concept. Our strong relationships with national and regional foodservice distributors ensure that our restaurants receive a constant supply of products. Products are shipped directly to the restaurants, and we do not maintain a central product warehouse or commissary.
Our corporate executive chef and our director of purchasing also establish strict product specifications for those items purchased at the local level. Purchasing at each restaurant is directed primarily by each restaurant’s chef, who is trained in our purchasing philosophy and specifications, and who works with regional and corporate managers to ensure consistent products. Each of our restaurants also has an in-house sommelier responsible for purchasing wines based on customer preferences, market availability and menu content.
We have not experienced any significant delays in receiving restaurant supplies and equipment. Although we currently do not engage in futures contracts or other financial risk management strategies with respect to potential price fluctuations, from time to time, we may opportunistically enter into fixed price beef supply contracts or contracts for other food products or consider 
3

other risk management strategies with regard to our meat and other food costs to minimize the impact of potential price fluctuations. This practice could help stabilize our food costs during times of fluctuating prices, although there can be no assurances that this will occur.
Marketing and Advertising
We believe that our commitment to providing quality food, hospitality, service and a high level of value for each price point is an effective approach to attracting customers and maintaining their loyalty. We use a variety of national, regional and local marketing and public relations techniques intended to maintain and build our customer traffic, maintain and enhance our concepts’ images and continually improve and refine our upscale experience. In addition, local restaurant marketing is important to the success of our concepts. For example, each restaurant’s general manager cultivates relationships with local businesses and luxury hotels that drive the restaurant’s business, in particular its private dining business. We also work with a national public relations firm that coordinates local firms in connection with new restaurant openings. The Double Eagle, Grille and Sullivan’s each use specific marketing and advertising initiatives to position the concepts in the applicable segment of our industry, including advertisement placement in magazines, digital advertising and social media targeting the affluent segment of the population.
Competition
The full-service steak industry and general upscale restaurant businesses are highly competitive and fragmented, and the number, size and strength of competitors vary widely by region, especially within the general upscale restaurant segment. We believe restaurant competition is based on quality of food products, customer service, reputation, restaurant décor, location, name recognition and price. Depending on the specific concept, our restaurants compete with a number of restaurants within their markets, both locally-owned restaurants and restaurants that are part of regional or national chains. The principal competitors for our Double Eagle and Sullivan’s concepts are other upscale steakhouses including local independents and chains such as Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar, The Capital Grille, Smith & Wollensky, The Palm, Ruth’s Chris Steak House and Morton’s The Steakhouse. The principal competitors for our Grille concept also include other upscale chains such as Hillstone, Paul Martin’s American Grill and Earl’s Kitchen + Bar. Our concepts also compete with additional restaurants in the broader upscale dining segment.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations comparable to most restaurants. Historically, like other restaurants in our segment, the percentage of our annual revenues earned during the first and fourth fiscal quarters has been typically higher due to holiday traffic, increased gift card purchases and redemptions and increased private dining during the year-end holiday season. In addition, we operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending the last Tuesday of each December, and our first, second and third quarters each contain 12 operating weeks with the fourth quarter containing 16 or 17 operating weeks. Starting in fiscal 2018, we will begin to use 12 periods for our fiscal reporting calendar, meaning that our first, second and third quarters will each contain 13 operating weeks with the fourth quarter containing 13 or 14 operating weeks. The fiscal years ended December 26, 2017, December 27, 2016 and December 29, 2015, which we refer to as fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively, had 52 weeks. The following fiscal year that will end on December 25, 2018, which we refer to as fiscal 2018, will also have 52 weeks.
Intellectual Property
We have registered the names Del Frisco’s, Double Eagle Steakhouse, Sullivan’s, and Del Frisco’s Grille and have applications pending to register certain other names and logos as trade names, trademarks or service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in certain foreign countries. We have the exclusive right for use of these trademarks throughout the United States, other than with respect to the following. A third party that operates a single restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky has an exclusive license to use Del Frisco’s name within a 50-mile radius of Louisville, Kentucky. We do not have any right to any future or recurring payments from or have any affirmative payment obligations to the third party and they are responsible for all costs associated with running their respective location, including all commodity and labor costs and any risks related thereto. In fiscal 2016, we entered into an agreement to obtain and clarify the naming rights in certain counties in Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio related to this unrelated third party for aggregate consideration of $0.6 million. We are also aware of names similar to those of our restaurants used by various third parties in certain limited geographical areas. We believe that our trade names, trademarks and service marks are valuable to the operation of our restaurants and are important to our marketing strategy.

Government Regulation
Our restaurants are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local health, safety, fire and other authorities, including licensing and regulation requirements for the sale of alcoholic beverages and food. We maintain the necessary restaurant, alcoholic beverage and retail licenses, permits and approvals. The development and construction of additional restaurants will also be subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. Federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws regulate, among other things, minimum wage, overtime, tips, tip credits, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, health insurance, citizenship requirements and other working conditions. Our restaurants are subject in each state in which we operate to “dram shop” laws, which allow, in general, a person to sue us if that person was injured by an intoxicated person who was wrongfully served alcoholic beverages at one of our restaurants. A judgment against us under a dram shop law could exceed our liability insurance coverage policy limits and could result in substantial liability for us and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our inability to continue to obtain such insurance coverage at reasonable costs also could have a material adverse effect on us. We are also subject to the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment.
Employees
As of December 26, 2017, we had approximately 4,890 employees. Many of our hourly employees are employed on a part-time basis to provide services necessary during peak periods of restaurant operations. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
