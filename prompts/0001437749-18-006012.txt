ITEM 1. Business
GENERAL BUSINESS
 Our Company
 
GulfMark Offshore, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in 1996. Unless otherwise indicated, references to “we”, “us”, “our” and the “Company” refer to GulfMark Offshore, Inc., its subsidiaries and its predecessors. We provide offshore marine support and transportation services primarily to companies involved in the offshore exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Our vessels transport materials, supplies and personnel to offshore facilities, and also move and position drilling and production facilities. The majority of our operations are conducted in the North Sea, offshore Southeast Asia and offshore the Americas. As of March 30, 2018, we operate a fleet of 69 owned or managed offshore supply vessels, or OSVs, in the following regions: 30 vessels in the North Sea, 10 vessels offshore Southeast Asia, and 29 vessels offshore the Americas. Our fleet is one of the world’s youngest, largest and most geographically balanced, high specification OSV fleets. Our owned vessels have an average age of approximately 11 years. 
 
We have three operating segments: the North Sea, Southeast Asia and the Americas. Our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial information about each of these operating segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate our performance. Our operations within each of these geographic regions have similar economic characteristics, services, distribution methods and regulatory concerns. All of the operating segments are considered reportable segments under Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, No. 280, “Segment Reporting,” or ASC 280. For financial information about our operating segments and geographic areas, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Segment Results” included in Part II, Item 7, and Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 842 West Sam Houston Parkway North, Suite 400, Houston, Texas 77024, and our telephone number at that address is (713) 963-9522. We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. Our SEC filings are available free of charge to the public over the internet on our website at http://www.gulfmark.com and at the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.

Emergence from Bankruptcy Proceedings and Fresh Start Accounting
 
On May 17, 2017, GulfMark Offshore, Inc. filed a voluntary petition, or the Chapter 11 Case, under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code, or the Bankruptcy Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, or the Bankruptcy Court. On October 4, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order, or the Confirmation Order, approving the Amended Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization, as confirmed, or the Plan. On November 14, 2017, or the Effective Date, the Plan became effective pursuant to its terms and we emerged from the Chapter 11 Case. On the Effective Date, we adopted and applied the relevant guidance with respect to the accounting and financial reporting for entities that have emerged from bankruptcy proceedings, or Fresh Start Accounting. Under Fresh Start Accounting, our balance sheet on the Effective Date reflects all of our assets and liabilities at their fair values. Our emergence and the adoption of Fresh Start Accounting resulted in a new reporting entity, or the Successor, for financial reporting purposes. To facilitate our discussion and analysis of our vessels, financial condition and results of operations herein, we refer to the reorganized company as the Successor for periods subsequent to November 14, 2017 and the Predecessor for periods prior to November 15, 2017. 
 
On the Effective Date, the Predecessor implemented the terms of the restructuring support agreement, or the RSA, that the Predecessor had entered into with certain holders, or the Noteholders, of the Predecessor’s senior notes, to support a restructuring on the terms of the Plan.  The RSA provided for, among other things, a $125 million cash rights offering for Successor equity, the exchange of the Predecessor’s senior notes plus unpaid interest for Successor equity, the cancellation of all of the Predecessor’s Class A common stock and the issuance of Successor equity to the Predecessor’s stockholders.  The Successor also obtained a term loan and revolving credit facility upon emergence.
 
For a more detailed discussion of our bankruptcy proceedings and disclosure of our final Predecessor balance sheet as of November 14, 2017 and our beginning Successor balance sheet as of November 15, 2017 see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7, and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.

Offshore Marine Services Industry Overview
 
We utilize our vessels to provide services to our customers supporting the construction, positioning and ongoing operation of offshore oil and natural gas drilling rigs and platforms and related infrastructure, and substantially all of our revenue is derived from providing these services. The offshore marine services industry employs various types of OSVs that are used to transport materials, supplies and personnel, and to move and position drilling and production facilities. Offshore marine service providers are employed by companies that are engaged in the offshore exploration and production of oil and natural gas and related services. Services provided by companies in this industry are performed in numerous locations worldwide. The major markets that employ a large number of vessels include the North Sea, offshore Southeast Asia, offshore West Africa, offshore the Middle East, offshore Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. Vessel usage is also significant in other international markets, including offshore India, offshore Australia, offshore Trinidad, the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean Sea, offshore Russia and offshore East Africa. The industry is fragmented with many multi-national and regional competitors.
 
Our business is directly impacted by the level of activity in worldwide offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, which in turn is influenced by trends in oil and natural gas prices. In addition, oil and natural gas prices are affected by a host of geopolitical and economic forces, including the fundamental principles of supply and demand. In particular, the oil price is significantly influenced by actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC. Beginning in late 2014, the oil and gas industry experienced a significant decline in the price of oil causing an industry-wide downturn that continues into 2018. Beginning in late 2014, oil prices declined significantly from early year levels of over $100 per barrel. Prices continued to decline throughout 2015 and into 2016, reaching a low of less than $30 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016. Prices began to recover over the remainder of 2016, stabilizing at over $40 per barrel for much of the second and third quarters of 2016 and further increasing to over $50 per barrel by year end. Prices are subject to significant uncertainty and continue to be volatile, declining again in early 2017 before recovering to over $60 per barrel in January 2018. The downturn of the last few years has significantly impacted the operational plans for oil companies, resulting in reduced expenditures for exploration and production activities, and consequently has adversely affected the drilling and support service sector. The ongoing and sustained decline in the price of oil that began in 2014 has materially and adversely affected our results of operations. These lower commodity prices have negatively impacted our revenues, earnings and cash flows, and further sustained low oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.
 
The characteristics and current marketing environment in each operating segment are discussed below in greater detail. Each of the major geographic offshore oil and natural gas production regions has unique characteristics that influence the economics of exploration and production and, consequently, the market demand for vessels in support of these activities. While there is some vessel interchangeability between geographic regions, barriers such as mobilization costs, vessel suitability and cabotage restrict migration of some vessels between regions. This is most notable in the North Sea, where vessel design requirements dictated by the harsh operating environment may restrict relocation of vessels into that market, and in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where entry into the market is subject to Jones Act restrictions. Conversely, these same design characteristics make North Sea capable vessels unsuitable for other areas where draft restrictions and, to a lesser degree, higher operating costs, restrict migration. 
 
WORLDWIDE FLEET
 
In addition to the vessels we own, we manage vessels for third-party owners, providing support services ranging from chartering assistance to full operational management. Although these managed vessels provide limited direct financial contribution, the added market presence can provide a competitive advantage for the manager. In addition, as a result of the industry downturn, we have removed some vessels from active service (also called stacking) to preserve cash flow. The following table summarizes our overall owned, managed and total fleet changes since December 31, 2016 and our stacked vessels as of March 30, 2018:

Vessel Classifications
 
OSVs generally fall into one or more of seven functional classifications derived from their primary or predominant operating characteristics or capabilities. These classifications are not rigid, however, and it is not unusual for a vessel to fit into more than one of the categories. These functional classifications are:

● | Anchor Handling, Towing and Support Vessels, or AHTSs, are used to set anchors for drilling rigs and to tow mobile drilling rigs and equipment from one location to another. In addition, these vessels typically can be used in supply roles when they are not performing anchor handling and towing services. They are characterized by shorter aft decks and special equipment such as towing winches. Vessels of this type with less than 10,000 brake horsepower, or BHP, are referred to as small AHTSs, or SmAHTSs, while AHTSs in excess of 10,000 BHP are referred to as large AHTSs, or LgAHTSs. The most powerful North Sea class AHTSs have up to 25,000 BHP. All of our AHTSs can also function as platform supply vessels.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Platform Supply Vessels, or PSVs, serve drilling and production facilities and support offshore construction and maintenance work. They are differentiated from other OSVs by their cargo handling capabilities, particularly their large capacity and versatility. PSVs utilize space on deck and below deck and are used to transport supplies such as fuel, water, drilling fluids, equipment and provisions. PSVs typically range in size from 150 to 300 feet. Large PSVs, or LgPSVs, generally range from 210 to 300 feet in length, with a few vessels somewhat larger, and are particularly suited for supporting large concentrations of offshore production locations because of their large, clear after deck and below deck capacities. The majority of the LgPSVs we operate function primarily in this classification but are also capable of servicing construction support.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fast Supply or Crew Vessels, or FSVs or crewboats, transport personnel and cargo to and from production platforms and rigs. Older crewboats (early 1980s build or earlier) are typically 100 to 120 feet in length and are designed for speed and to transport personnel. Newer crewboat designs are generally larger, 130 to 185 feet in length, and can be longer with greater cargo carrying capacities. Vessels in the larger category are also called fast supply vessels. They are used primarily to transport cargo on a time-sensitive basis.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Specialty Vessels, or SpVs, generally have special features to meet the requirements of specific jobs. The special features can include large deck spaces, high electrical generating capacities, slow controlled speed and varied propulsion thruster configurations, extra berthing facilities and long-range capabilities. These vessels are primarily used to support floating production storing and offloading; diving operations; remotely operated vehicles; survey operations and seismic data gathering; as well as oil recovery, oil spill response and well stimulation. Some of our owned vessels frequently provide specialty functions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Standby Rescue Vessels perform a safety patrol function for a particular area and are required for all manned locations in the North Sea and in some other locations where oil and natural gas exploitation occurs. These vessels typically remain on station to provide a safety backup to offshore rigs and production facilities and carry special equipment to rescue personnel. They are equipped to provide first aid, shelter and, in some cases, function as support vessels.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Construction Support Vessels are vessels such as pipe-laying barges, diving support vessels or specially designed vessels, such as pipe carriers, used to transport the large cargos of material and supplies required to support the construction and installation of offshore platforms and pipelines. A large number of our LgPSVs also function as pipe carriers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Utility Vessels are typically 90 to 150 feet in length and are used to provide limited crew transportation, some transportation of oilfield support equipment and, in some locations, standby functions.

Vessel Construction, Acquisitions and Divestitures
 
During 2016, the Predecessor sold one older vessel from our North Sea region fleet and three vessels from our Southeast Asia fleet for combined proceeds of $6.5 million. The sales of these vessels generated a combined loss on sales of assets of $8.6 million. In March 2017, the Predecessor sold two fast supply vessels and recorded combined losses on sales of assets of $5.3 million.
 
At December 31, 2015, we had two vessels under construction in the U.S. that were significantly delayed. In March 2016, we resolved certain matters under dispute with the shipbuilder and reset the contract schedules so that we would take delivery of the first vessel in mid-2016 and the second vessel in mid-2017, at which time a final payment of $26.0 million would be due. We took delivery of the first of these vessels during the second quarter of 2016. Under the settlement, we could elect not to take delivery of the second vessel and forego the final payment, in which case the shipbuilder would retain the vessel. In May 2017, we elected not to take the vessel. We have no further purchase obligations under such contract.
 
We had a vessel under construction in Norway that was scheduled to be completed and delivered during the first quarter of 2016; however, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we amended our contract with the shipbuilder to delay delivery of the vessel until January 2017. Concurrently, in order to delay the payment of a substantial portion of the construction costs, we agreed to pay monthly installments through May 2016 totaling 92.2 million NOK (or approximately $11.0 million) and to pay a final installment on delivery in January 2017 of 195.0 million NOK (or approximately $23.3 million at delivery). We paid such final installment and took delivery of this vessel in January 2017.

Maintenance of Our Vessels and Drydocking Obligations
 
We are required to make expenditures for the certification and maintenance of our actively marketed vessels, and those expenditures typically increase with the age of the vessels. We have determined that generally we will not maintain stacked vessels in class until they are likely to achieve positive cash flow in a return to market. However, we will determine the need to perform drydocks in some circumstances such as the ability to easily maintain class or a potential sale. The deferred drydocks will eventually be required prior to returning the vessels to active service and, depending on numerous factors such as length of time a vessel has been idle or stacked, the cost for such a drydock could be materially more than a normal drydock. The demands of the market, management judgment as to which vessels to market and which vessels to stack, the expiration of existing contracts, the commencement of new contracts, and customer preferences influence the timing of drydocks. Future drydock costs will depend on vessel activity and vessel class requirements. For accounting purposes, prior to the Effective Date the Predecessor expensed the cost of drydocks as the costs were incurred. Under Fresh Start Accounting, the Successor has elected to capitalize the cost of drydocks and amortize the costs to expense over 30 months.

Market and Segment Overview
 
We define the North Sea market as offshore Norway, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Faeroe Islands, Greenland and the Barents Sea. Historically, this market has been the most demanding of all exploration frontiers due to harsh weather, erratic sea conditions, significant water depth and some long sailing distances. Exploration and production operators in the North Sea market have typically been large and well-capitalized entities (major and state-owned oil and natural gas companies and large independents) in large part because of the significant financial commitment required. Projects in the North Sea tend to be large in scope with long planning horizons. As a result, vessel demand in the North Sea has historically been more stable and less susceptible to abrupt swings than in other regions. 
 
The North Sea market can be broadly divided into three service segments: exploration support; production platform support; and field development and construction (which includes subsea services). The exploration support services market represents the primary demand for AHTSs and has historically been the most volatile segment of the North Sea market. While PSVs support the exploration segment, they also support the production platform and field development and construction segments, which generally are not affected significantly by the volatility in demand for the AHTSs. Our North Sea-based fleet is oriented toward supply vessels that work production platform support and field development and construction, which are the more stable segments of the market. 
 
Unless deployed to one of our other operating segments under long-term contract, vessels based in the North Sea but operating temporarily out of the region are included in our North Sea operating segment statistics, and all vessels based out of the region are supported through our onshore bases in Aberdeen, Scotland and Sandnes, Norway. The region typically has weaker periods of demand for vessels in the winter months of October through February primarily due to lower construction activity and harsh weather conditions affecting the movement of drilling rigs. 
 
Market Development
 
Vessel demand in the North Sea is directly related to drilling and development activities in the region and construction work required in support of these activities. Geopolitical events, the demand for oil and natural gas in both mature and emerging countries, commodity prices and a host of other factors influence the expenditures of both independent and major oil and gas companies.
 
Exploration and development spending in the North Sea has declined in each year since the beginning of the market downturn that began in late 2014, as operators continue to be cautious in the lower oil price environment. Future commodity price uncertainty has put long-term planning and significant commitments to future spending on hold as operators focus on cost savings, efficiencies and cash preservation.

Market and Segment Overview
 
The Southeast Asia market is defined as offshore Asia bounded roughly on the west by the Indian subcontinent and on the north by China, then south to Australia and east to the Pacific Islands. This market includes offshore Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea and Vietnam. Traditionally, the design requirements for vessels in this market were generally similar to the requirements of the shallow water U.S. Gulf of Mexico. However, advanced exploration technology and rapid growth in energy demand among many Pacific Rim countries have led to more remote drilling locations, which has increased both the overall demand and the technical requirements for vessels. All vessels based out of the region are supported through our primary onshore base in Singapore.
 
Southeast Asia’s customer environment is broadly characterized by national oil companies of smaller nations and a large number of mid-sized companies, in contrast to many of the other major offshore exploration and production areas of the world, where a few large operators dominate the market. Affiliations with local companies are generally necessary to maintain a viable marketing presence. Our management has been involved in the region for many years and we continue to maintain long-standing business relationships with a number of local companies.
Market Development
 
Vessels in this market are often smaller than those operating in areas such as the North Sea. However, the varying weather conditions, annual monsoons, severe typhoons and long distances between supply centers in Southeast Asia have allowed for a variety of vessel designs to compete, each suited for a particular set of operating parameters. Vessels designed for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and other areas, where moderate weather conditions prevail, historically made up the bulk of the vessels in the Southeast Asia market. However, over the last several years Southeast Asian and Chinese shipyards have been focusing on larger, newer and higher specification vessels for deepwater projects and inclusion in the larger vessel fleet.
 
Changes in supply and demand dynamics have led to an excess number of vessels. It is possible that vessels currently located in the Arabian/Persian Gulf area, offshore Africa or the U.S. Gulf of Mexico could relocate to the Southeast Asia market; however, not all vessels currently located in those regions would be able to operate in Southeast Asia and oil and natural gas operators in this region continue to demand newer, higher specification vessels. Some countries have specified age limitations for vessels to operate in territorial waters, which limitations could adversely affect our ability to work in those markets. In addition, speculative building at Southeast Asian and Chinese yards as described above has led to a significant overhang of new build vessels, particularly in the mid-size PSV class and smaller AHTSs. Southeast Asia is a dynamic market and from time to time certain types of vessels may be subject to more intense competition. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Markets – Southeast Asia” included in Part II, Item 7.

Market and Segment Overview
 
We define the Americas market as offshore North, Central and South America, specifically including the United States, Mexico, Trinidad and Brazil. All vessels based in the Americas are supported from our onshore bases in the United States, Mexico, Trinidad and Brazil. During 2017, due to the continued lower crude oil price environment and the resulting negative impact on demand for OSVs, we experienced further significant downward pressure on our utilization and day rates in all areas in which we operate. In response, we have kept a number of vessels stacked to reduce operating expenses, preserve cash through deferred drydockings and improve the supply/demand balance in the market. We had 18 vessels of our 31 vessels stacked in the Americas at the end of 2017. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Markets – Americas” included in Part II, Item 7.
 
Market Development 

U.S. Gulf of Mexico
 
Drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico can be divided into three sectors: the shallow waters of the continental shelf, the deepwater and the ultra-deepwater areas. The continental shelf has been explored since the late 1940s and the existing infrastructure and knowledge of this sector allows for incremental drilling costs to be on the lower end of the range of worldwide offshore drilling costs. A surge of deepwater drilling in this sector began in the 1990s as advances in technology made this type of drilling economically feasible. Deepwater and ultra-deepwater drilling is on the higher end of the cost range, and the substantial costs and long lead times required in these types of drilling historically have made it less susceptible to short-term fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas, although all offshore drilling sectors have been dramatically impacted by the current market downturn. We do not expect significant recovery in deepwater or ultra-deepwater drilling until there is some stability in oil prices for several consecutive quarters. Most of our active vessels operate in the deepwater and ultra-deepwater areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
 
At the end of 2017, industry reports indicated that there were 33 “floater” rigs (semi-submersibles and drillships) supporting deepwater drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico with 23 in working locations. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Gulf of Mexico federal offshore oil production accounts for 17% of total U.S. crude oil production. We expect there to be a marginal recovery in the number of active floaters in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in the next 12 to 18 months. Since there is a significant oversupply of vessels in the market it will be up to the OSV operators to practice market discipline on vessel stackings, scrappings and reducing spot vessel availability. Vessels that have been stacked for several years now will require over $1.0 million in costs per vessel to complete a special survey and go through a reactivation process. Assuming continuation of current market conditions, we anticipate a few more quarters of low utilization and cash breakeven levels with gradual recovery into 2019 as older tonnage is removed permanently from the market and demand increases over time. Marine transportation companies that operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico continue to manage challenging operational and financial issues, some more severe than others. If market conditions do not stabilize as indicated above or instead deteriorate, we expect any eventual recovery to be further delayed.
 
 13



In general, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico remains a protected market that is subject to U.S. cabotage laws that impose certain restrictions on the ownership and operation of vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade, which we refer to as Coastwise Trade. These laws are principally contained in 46 U.S.C. Chapters 121, 505 and 551 and the related regulations, which are commonly referred to collectively as the “Jones Act.” Under the Jones Act, Coastwise Trade is the transportation of merchandise and passengers for hire between points in the United States. Subject to limited exceptions, the Jones Act requires that vessels engaged in Coastwise Trade be owned and operated by U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act, which we refer to as U.S. Citizens, be built in and registered under the laws of the United States, and manned by predominantly U.S. Citizen crews.
 
As of the date of this report, we are actively marketing 11 DP-2 class OSVs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. These vessels support the shelf, deepwater and ultra-deepwater activities of the oil and gas industry including, but not limited to, seismic operations, oil and gas exploration, field development, production, offshore pipeline inspection and survey, subsea installation and oil recovery activities. We believe that drilling operators in the Gulf of Mexico generally prefer DP-2 class vessels. All of our U.S. flagged OSVs that are in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are DP-2 class vessels.
 
Mexico

Since 2005, we have operated Small AHTSs and other OSVs offshore Mexico. During the past several years, we have from time to time moved various vessels into and out of the area from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In December 2013, Mexico’s Congress approved a constitutional reform to allow private investment in Mexico’s energy sector which effectively ended the state controlled (Petróleos Mexicanos) 75-year monopoly on oil and natural gas extraction and production. Mexico’s recent shelf and deepwater oil auctions were reported to have surpassed expectations with awards by the National Hydrocarbons Commission to some of the world’s top oil and gas companies. We regularly operate two vessels offshore Mexico.
Trinidad
 
Over the past five years we mobilized several vessels between Trinidad and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea. Given recent licensing and exploration activity in nearby locations, including Suriname and Guyana, we anticipate having OSVs operating offshore Trinidad for the foreseeable future. We operated four vessels offshore Trinidad at the end of 2017, although two of those vessels completed their contracts and were mobilized back to the North Sea in January 2018.
Brazil
 
Brazil, which was once considered a key market for stable, long term PSV charters, continues to feel the effects of low oil prices which have resulted in the cancellation or renegotiation of numerous PSV charters as Petróleo Brasileiro S.A., or Petrobras, defers capital expenditures.  Also, many Brazilian PSV owners have asserted their rights to challenge foreign flagged vessels on their charters. We have mobilized all but one vessel out of the region. 
 
Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for segment and geographical revenue, profit or loss and total assets data during our last three fiscal years.
 
OTHER
 
Seasonality 
 
Operations in the North Sea are generally at their highest levels from April through August and at their lowest levels from December through February primarily due to lower construction activity and harsh weather conditions during the winter months, which reduces the demand for movement of drilling rigs and deliveries to offshore platforms. Vessels operating offshore Southeast Asia are generally at their lowest utilization rates during the monsoon season, which moves across the Asian continent between September and early March. The monsoon season for a specific Southeast Asian location generally lasts about two months. Activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is often lower during the North Atlantic hurricane season of June through November, although following a hurricane, activity may increase as there may be a greater demand for vessel services as repair and remediation activities take place. Operations in any market may, however, be affected by seasonality often related to unusually long or short construction seasons due to, among other things, abnormal weather conditions, as well as market demand associated with increased or decreased drilling and development activities.
Other Markets 
 
From time to time, we have contracted our vessels outside of our operating segment regions principally on short-term charters offshore Africa and in the Mediterranean region. We look to our core markets for the bulk of our term contracts; however, when the economics of a contract are attractive, or we believe it is strategically advantageous, we may operate our vessels in markets outside of our core regions. The operations of vessels in those markets are generally managed through our offices in the North Sea region.
 
 14



Customers, Contract Terms and Competition
 
Our principal customers are major integrated oil and natural gas companies, large independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies working in international markets, and foreign government-owned or controlled oil and natural gas companies. Additionally, our customers also include companies that provide logistic, construction and other services to such oil and natural gas companies and foreign government organizations. Generally, our contracts are industry standard time charters for periods ranging from a few days or months up to five years. Contract terms vary and often are similar within geographic regions with certain contracts containing cancellation provisions (in some cases permitting cancellation for any reason) and others containing non-cancellable provisions except in the case of unsatisfactory performance by the vessel. For the Successor period ended December 31, 2017, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Successor’s total consolidated revenue. For the Predecessor period ended November 14, 2017, we recognized revenue from EOG Resources in the amount of $9.0 million in our Americas region, accounting for more than 10% of our total consolidated revenue. For the Predecessor year ended December 31, 2016, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Predecessor’s total consolidated revenue. For the Predecessor year ended December 31, 2015, the Predecessor had revenue from BG Group and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation in our North Sea and Americas regions totaling $32.4 million and $31.9 million, respectively, each accounting for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenue. 
 
Contract or charter durations vary from single-day to multi-year in length, based upon many different factors that vary by market. Additionally, there are “evergreen” charters (also known as “life of field” or “forever” charters), and at the other end of the spectrum, there are “spot” charters and “short duration” charters, which can vary from a single voyage to charters of less than six months. Longer duration charters are more common where equipment is not as readily available or specific equipment is required. In the North Sea region, multi-year charters are more common and historically have constituted a significant portion of that market. In the Southeast Asia region, term charters have historically been less common than in the North Sea and generally have terms of less than two years. In the Americas, particularly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, charters vary in length from short-term to multi-year periods, many with short-term cancellation clauses. In Brazil, Mexico and Trinidad contracts vary from spot contracts to multi-year term contracts. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Fleet Commitments and Backlog” included in Part II, Item 7. 
 
Managed vessels add to the market presence of the manager but provide limited direct financial contribution. Management fees consist of a fixed annual fee. The manager is typically responsible for disbursement of funds for operating the vessel on behalf of the owner. Currently, we have three vessels under management.
 
Substantially all of our charters are fixed in British Pounds, or GBP; Norwegian Kroner, or NOK; Euros; or U.S. Dollars. We attempt to reduce currency risk by matching each vessel’s contract revenue to the currency in which its operating expenses are incurred. 
 
We have numerous mid-size and large competitors in the North Sea, Southeast Asia and Americas markets, some of which have significantly greater financial resources than we have. We compete principally on the basis of suitability of equipment, price and service. In the Americas region, we benefit from the provisions of the Jones Act which limits vessels that can operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to those with U.S. ownership. Also, in certain foreign countries, preferences given to vessels owned by local companies may be mandated by local law or by national oil companies. We have attempted to mitigate some of the impact of such preferences through affiliations with local companies.
 
Government and Environmental Regulation 
 
We must comply with extensive government regulation in the form of international conventions, federal, state, and local laws and regulations in jurisdictions where our vessels operate and/or are registered. These conventions, laws and regulations govern matters of environmental protection, worker health and safety, vessel and port security, and the manning, construction, ownership and operation of vessels, including cabotage requirements. Our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the United States Coast Guard and the United States Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, as well as their foreign equivalents. The Coast Guard sets safety standards and is authorized to inspect vessels at will to enforce those standards and various laws, and the Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board are authorized to investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards. The CBP is authorized to inspect vessels at will to enforce compliance with immigration and trade laws and regulations. Further, with regard to environmental regulations, we are subject to the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, as well as analogous state and local environmental agencies. Our operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico may, from time to time, fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and its Safety and Environmental Management System regulations, in which case we are also required to certify that our maritime operations adhere to those regulations. In addition, we are subject to regulation by private industry organizations such as the American Bureau of Shipping and Det Norske Veritas. We are also subject to international laws and conventions and the laws of international jurisdictions where we operate. We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. 
 
 15



Maritime Regulations
 
We are subject to the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, which provides that, upon proclamation by the President of the United States of a national emergency or a threat to the security of the national defense, the Secretary of Transportation may requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by United States citizens (which includes our company), including vessels under construction in the United States. If any of the vessels in our fleet were purchased or requisitioned by the federal government under this law, we would be entitled to be paid just compensation, which is generally the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or, in the case of a requisition, the fair market value of charter hire. However, we would not be entitled to be compensated for any consequential damages we suffer as a result of the requisition or purchase of any of our vessels.
Under the Jones Act, the transportation of merchandise or passengers for hire in Coastwise Trade is restricted to vessels that are qualified under the Jones Act, which are vessels that are owned and operated by U.S. Citizens, built in and registered under the laws of the United States, and manned by predominantly U.S. Citizen crews. A corporation is not considered a U.S. Citizen for purposes of owning and operating a vessel in Coastwise Trade unless:

● | the corporation is organized under the laws of the United States or of a state, territory or possession thereof;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the chief executive officer, by whatever title, and the chairman of the board of directors are U.S. Citizens;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | no more than a minority of the number of directors of such corporation necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business are non-U.S. Citizens; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | at least 75 percent of the ownership and voting power of each class or series of the shares of the capital stock is owned by, voted by and controlled by U.S. Citizens, free from any trust or fiduciary obligations in favor of, or any contract or understanding under which voting power or control may be exercised directly or indirectly on behalf of, non-U.S. Citizens.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are currently a U.S. Citizen under these requirements and hence eligible to engage in Coastwise Trade. If we fail to comply with these U.S. Citizen requirements, however, we would no longer be considered a U.S. Citizen. Such an event could result in our ineligibility to engage in Coastwise Trade, the imposition of substantial penalties against us, including fines and seizure and forfeiture of our vessels, and the inability to flag our vessels in the United States and maintain a coastwise endorsement, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
To facilitate compliance with the Jones Act, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws: (i) limit the aggregate percentage ownership by non-U.S. Citizens of any class or series of our capital stock (including Common Stock) to 24% of the outstanding shares of each such class or series to ensure that ownership by non-U.S. Citizens will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by applicable maritime law (presently 25%); (ii) provide that any issuance or transfer of shares in excess of such permitted percentage shall be ineffective as against our company and that neither our company nor its transfer agent shall register such purported issuance or transfer of shares or be required to recognize the purported transferee or owner as a stockholder of our company for any purpose whatsoever except to exercise our company’s remedies; (iii) provide that any such excess shares shall not have any voting or dividend rights; (iv) permit our company to redeem any such excess shares; and (v) permit the Board of Directors to make such reasonable determinations as may be necessary to ascertain such ownership and implement such limitations.
 
Environmental Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations regarding the emission or discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. As some environmental laws impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances, we could be subject to liability even if we were not negligent or at fault. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, including charterers.
Numerous governmental authorities, such as the Coast Guard, EPA, analogous state agencies, and, in certain instances, citizens’ groups, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, revocation of permits, issuance of corrective action orders and suspension or termination of our operations. Environmental laws and regulations may change in ways that substantially increase costs, or impose additional requirements or restrictions which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental laws and regulations, but failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have material adverse consequences. Environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, including the suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. As such, there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not be incurred in the future.
 
 16



International Safety Management and International Ship & Port Facility Security Codes
 
The International Maritime Organization, or IMO, has made the regulations of the International Safety Management Code, or ISM Code, mandatory through the adoption by flag states of the ISM Code under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. The ISM Code provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships, pollution prevention and certain crew and vessel certifications. IMO has also adopted the International Ship & Port Facility Security Code, or ISPS Code. The ISPS Code provides that owners or operators of certain vessels and facilities must provide security and security plans for their vessels and facilities and obtain appropriate certification of compliance. We believe all of our vessels presently are certificated in accordance with ISPS Code. The risks of incurring substantial compliance costs, liabilities and penalties for noncompliance are inherent in offshore marine operations. 
International Labour Organization’s Maritime Labour Convention
 
The International Labour Organization’s Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, as amended, or the MLC, entered into force on August 20, 2013. Since then, 88 countries have ratified the MLC, making for a diverse geographic footprint of enforcement. The MLC establishes comprehensive minimum requirements for working conditions of seafarers including, among other things, conditions of employment, hours of work and rest, grievance and complaints procedures, accommodations, recreational facilities, food and catering, health protection, medical care, welfare, and social security protection. The MLC also provides a definition of seafarer that includes all persons engaged in work on a vessel in addition to the vessel's crew. Under this MLC definition, we may be responsible for proving that customer and contractor personnel aboard its vessels have contracts of employment that comply with the MLC requirements. We could also be responsible for salaries and/or benefits of third parties that may board one of our vessels. The MLC requires certain vessels that engage in international trade to maintain a valid Maritime Labour Certificate issued by their flag administration. Although the United States is not a party to the MLC, U.S.-flag vessels operating internationally must comply with the MLC when visiting a port in a country that is a party to the MLC. 
 
Accordingly, we continue prioritizing certification of our vessels to MLC requirements based on the dates of enforcement by countries in which we have operations, recruit seafarers, perform maintenance and repairs at shipyards, or may make port calls during ocean voyages. Once obtained, vessel certifications are maintained, regardless of the area of operation. Additionally, where possible, we continue to work with certain flag states to seek substantial equivalencies to comparable national and industry laws that meet the intent of the MLC, but allow us to maintain our longstanding operational protocols and mitigate changes to our business processes. As ratifications of the MLC continue, we continue to assess our global seafarer labor relationships and fleet operational practices not only to undertake compliance with the MLC but also to gauge the impact of enforcement, the effects of which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
 
MARPOL
 
The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978, or MARPOL, is the main IMO international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by vessels from operational or accidental causes. MARPOL has been updated by amendments through the years and is implemented in the United States by the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships. MARPOL has six specific annexes. Of relevance to our operations, Annex I governs oil pollution, Annex V governs garbage pollution, and Annex VI governs air pollution.
 
MARPOL Annex VI, which addresses air emissions from vessels, requires the use of low sulfur fuel worldwide in both auxiliary and main propulsion diesel engines on ships. Annex VI also specifies requirements for Emission Control Areas, or ECAs, with stricter limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas. Historically, ships operating in the Baltic Sea ECA, the North Sea/English Channel ECA and the North American ECA were required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 1% or use alternative emission reduction methods rather than the current 3.5% global (non-ECA) limit. Beginning in January 2015, the fuel sulfur content limit in ECAs was reduced to 0.1%. The MARPOL global limit on fuel sulfur content outside of ECAs will be reduced to 0.5% beginning in January 2020. We may incur additional compliance costs as part of our efforts to comply with Annex VI and other provisions of MARPOL. In addition, we could face fines and penalties for failure to meet requirements imposed by MARPOL and similar laws related to the operation of our vessels.
 
The Clean Water Act
 
The Clean Water Act, or CWA, imposes strict controls on the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters of the United States. The CWA also provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharge of oil or other hazardous substances in reportable quantities and imposes liability for the costs of removal and remediation of an unauthorized discharge. Many states have laws that are analogous to the CWA and also require remediation of accidental releases of petroleum or other pollutants in reportable quantities. Our vessels routinely transport diesel fuel to offshore rigs and platforms and also carry diesel fuel for their own use. We maintain response plans as required by the CWA to address potential oil and fuel spills from either our vessels or our shore-based facilities.
 
 17



In addition, the CWA established the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, permitting program, which governs discharges of pollutants into navigable waters of the United States from point sources, such as vessels operating in the navigable waters. Pursuant to the NPDES permitting program, the EPA issued a Vessel General Permit, or VGP. The current Vessel General Permit, or the 2013 VGP, which became effective on December 19, 2013, applies to commercial vessels that are at least 79 feet in length and therefore applies to our vessels. The 2013 VGP requires vessel owners and operators to adhere to “best management practices” to manage the 27 types of covered discharges, including ballast water, which occur normally in the operation of a vessel. In addition, the 2013 VGP requires vessel owners and operators to implement various training, inspection, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, as well as corrective actions upon identification of each deficiency. The purpose of these limitations is to reduce the number of living organisms discharged via ballast water into waters regulated by the 2013 VGP. The 2013 VGP also contains requirements for oil-to-sea interfaces, which seeks to improve environmental protection of U.S. waters, by requiring all vessels to use an “Environmentally Acceptable Lubricant” in all oil-to-sea interfaces, unless not technically feasible. These regulations may increase the costs of compliance for our operations. In addition, failure to comply with the requirements of the 2013 VGP and other provisions of the CWA could result in the imposition of substantial fines and penalties. The 2013 VGP expires on December 18, 2018. We expect a new VGP to be proposed in 2018, which may lead to additional compliance costs.
 
The Oil Pollution Act
 
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, establishes a comprehensive regulatory and liability regime designed to increase pollution prevention, ensure better spill response capability, increase liability for oil spills, and facilitate prompt compensation for cleanup and damages. OPA is applicable to owners and operators of facilities operating near U.S. navigable waters and to owners, operators and bareboat charterers whose vessels operate in U.S. waters, which include the navigable waters of the United States (generally three nautical miles from the coastline) and the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone of the United States. Under OPA, owners and operators of regulated facilities and owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels are “responsible parties” and are jointly, severally and strictly liable for removal costs and damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their facilities or vessels, respectively, up to their limits of liability (except if the limits are broken as described below) unless the discharge results solely from the act or omission of certain third parties under specified circumstances, an act of God or an act of war. “Damages” are defined broadly under OPA to include:

● | damages for injury to natural resources and the costs of remediation thereof;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | damages for injury to, or economic losses resulting from the destruction of, real or personal property;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees and profits by the United States government, and any state or political subdivision thereof;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to property or natural resources damage;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the net costs of providing increased or additional public services necessitated by a spill response, such as protection from fire or other hazards or taking additional safety precautions; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the loss of subsistence use of available natural resources.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 
OPA, through implementing regulations, currently limits the liability of responsible parties for discharges from non-tank vessels to $1,100 per gross ton or $939,800, whichever is greater. These limits are subject to increase. OPA’s liability limits do not apply: (1) if an incident was proximately caused by violation of applicable federal safety, construction or operating regulations or by a responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (2) if the responsible party fails or refuses to report the incident, fails to provide reasonable cooperation and assistance required by a responsible official in connection with oil removal activities, or without sufficient cause fails to comply with an order issued under OPA. If an oil discharge or a substantial threat of discharge were to occur involving one of our shore-based facilities or vessels, we may be liable for removal costs and damages, which could be material to our results of operations and financial position. In addition, failure to comply with OPA may result in the assessment of civil, administrative and criminal penalties.
 
In addition, OPA requires owners and operators of vessels over 300 gross tons to provide the Coast Guard with evidence of financial responsibility to cover the cost of cleaning up oil spills from such vessels. We have provided satisfactory evidence of financial responsibility to the Coast Guard for all of our vessels that are over 300 gross tons.
 
Under the Nontank Vessel Response Plan Final Rule, which became effective October 30, 2013, owners and operators of nontank vessels are required by the Coast Guard to prepare and submit Nontank Vessel Response Plans, or NTVRPs. This rule implemented a 2004 statutory mandate expanding oil spill response planning standards that are applicable to tank vessels under OPA amendments to the CWA to self-propelled nontank vessels of 400 or more gross tons that carry oil of any kind as fuel for main propulsion and that operate on the navigable waterways of the United States. Under this rule, we are required to prepare NTVRPs and contract with oil spill removal organizations to meet certain response planning requirements based on the capacity of a particular vessel. We have, in all material respects, complied with these requirements.
 
OPA allows states to impose their own liability regimes with respect to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries and many states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil spills. Some states have issued regulations addressing financial responsibility and vessel response planning requirements. We do not anticipate that state legislation or regulations will have a material impact on our operations.

Hazardous Wastes and Substances
 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, also known as CERCLA or Superfund, and similar laws, impose liability for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. CERCLA currently exempts crude oil from the definition of hazardous substances for purposes of the statute, but our operations may involve the use or handling of other materials that may be classified as hazardous substances. CERCLA assigns strict liability to each responsible party for all response costs, as well as natural resource damages. CERCLA also imposes liability similar to OPA and provides compensation for cleanup, removal and natural resource damages. Liability per vessel under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5 million, unless the release is the result of willful misconduct or willful negligence, the primary cause of the release was a violation of applicable safety, construction or operating standards or regulations, or the responsible person fails to provide reasonable cooperation and assistance in connection with response activities, in which case liability is unlimited. A responsible person may be liable to the United States for punitive damages up to three times the amount of any costs incurred by the federal Hazardous Substances Superfund as a result of such person’s failure to take proper action. We could be held liable for releases of hazardous substances that resulted from operations by third parties not under our control or for releases associated with practices performed by us or others that were standard in the industry at the time. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment.
 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, regulates the generation, transportation, storage, treatment and disposal of onshore hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of wastes. We generate non-hazardous wastes and small quantities of hazardous wastes in connection with routine operations. We believe that all of the wastes that we generate are handled, in all material respects, in compliance with RCRA and analogous state statutes.
 
Insurance
 
   We review our insurance coverages annually.  In particular, we assess our coverage levels and limits for possible marine liabilities, including pollution, personal injury or death, and property damage.  We can provide no assurance, however, that our insurance coverage will be available beyond the renewal periods, or that it will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise. Claims covered by insurance are subject to deductibles, the aggregate amount of which could be material. Insurance policies are also subject to certain exclusions and compliance with certain conditions, the failure of which could lead to a denial of coverage as to a particular claim or the voiding of a particular insurance policy. There can be no assurance that existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims. 
Litigation
 
We are not a party to any material pending regulatory litigation or other proceeding and we are unaware of any threatened litigation or proceeding, which, if adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
Employees
 
We have approximately 950 employees located principally in the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway and Southeast Asia. Through our contract with a crewing agency, we participate in the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements for approximately 420 contract crew members, approximately half of our labor force, who are members of two North Sea unions. Wages are renegotiated annually in the second half of each year for the North Sea unions. We have no other collective bargaining agreements; however, we do employ crew members who are members of national unions but we do not participate in the negotiation of those collective bargaining agreements. We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory. To date, our operations have not been interrupted by strikes or work stoppages. In addition, our obligations to our crew members are governed by the International Labour Organization’s Maritime Labour Convention which has been adopted in varying degrees by different flag states. We have adopted proactive procedures to ensure that we comply with or are entitled to an exemption from the Convention.
