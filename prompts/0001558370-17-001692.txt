 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Overview
 We are a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions. Given the need for acute and chronic pain products and the issue of prescription abuse, we are focused on bringing non-narcotic and abuse-deterrent opioid formulations to patients and physicians. We are currently marketing SPRIX® (ketorolac tromethamine) Nasal Spray (“SPRIX Nasal Spray”) and OXAYDO® (oxycodone HCI, USP) tablets for oral use only—CII (“OXAYDO”). On January 9, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved Egalet’s first product developed using our proprietary Guardian™ Technology ARYMO ER™ (morphine sulfate) extended-release (“ER”) tablets (“ARYMO ER”), an ER morphine product formulated with abuse-deterrent (“AD”) properties. ARYMO ER, which is approved for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate, will be made commercially available at the end of the first quarter 2017. We also are developing Egalet-002, a Guardian Technology AD, ER, oral oxycodone formulation currently in Phase 3 studies, for the same indication as ARYMO ER. We plan to continue to grow through the revenues of our three approved products, business development and leveraging our proprietary Guardian Technology.  Strategy
 Our goal is to be a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions. Key elements of our strategy include:
· | Execute our sales and marketing strategy for SPRIX Nasal Spray, OXAYDO and ARYMO ER. In 2016, we had 71-person specialty sales force targeting the approximately 11,500 physicians in the high‑decile of pain medicine prescribers in the United States with the intent to build awareness and increase adoption of both SPRIX and OXAYDO. With the pending launch of ARYMO ER, we are transitioning the salesforce into two separate teams. 50 territory managers will promote OXAYDO and ARYMO ER to approximately 6,000 healthcare providers. Another 32 territory managers will focus on educating approximately 4,500 healthcare providers about SPRIX Nasal Spray. In addition, we have an account management team calling on commercial and government payers and a trade team focused on channel partners.

· | Augment OXAYDO abuse-deterrent section of prescribing information label and develop additional dosage strengths. In December 2016, we filed a supplemental new drug application (“sNDA”) for OXAYDO with the FDA to support an abuse-deterrent label claim for the intravenous route of abuse. The application was based on data that was presented at the PAINWeek conference in September 2016. In addition, we submitted a prior approval supplement to the FDA for 10 mg and 15 mg dosage strengths of OXAYDO to potentially provide patients and physicians additional dosage options beyond the currently marketed 5 mg and 7.5 mg doses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop Egalet‑002 as an AD, ER oxycodone product for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate and obtain FDA approval of Egalet-002. We have a pivotal Phase 3 clinical development program for Egalet-002 ongoing. We have conducted Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (“PK”) trials of Egalet‑002, a battery of Category 1 AD studies compared to OxyContin, a Category 3 intranasal human abuse potential (“HAP”) study and a pilot Category 3 oral HAP study. We anticipate completing the Phase 3 program in the fourth quarter of 2017. The FDA has granted us Fast Track status with respect to Egalet‑002. Based on this and the expected timing of our clinical trials, we anticipate submitting an NDA for Egalet‑002 in 2019.

  Background on Pain and Prescription Opioid Abuse
 With approximately 100 million Americans suffering from chronic pain according to the Institute of Medicine—more than those affected by heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined—there is a substantial need for effective pain treatments. The millions suffering from acute or chronic pain every year greatly impact our country with increasing costs associated with health care, rehabilitation and lost worker productivity. Pain is a significant public health problem that costs society between $560.0 and $635.0 billion annually according to the Institute of Medicine. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (“NSAIDs”) are among the most widely used medications in the world because of their demonstrated efficacy in reducing pain and inflammation. In addition, IMS prescription data from 2015 shows that opioids are the most widely prescribed products for pain, with prescriptions exceeding 200 million in 2015.
 Unfortunately, drug abuse is a significant issue, with an estimated 29.0 million people suffering from drug use disorders worldwide according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, World Drug Report 2016. Per the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), an estimated 12.5 million Americans age 12 and older misused prescription pain relievers in the past year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) have stated that opioids accounted for approximately 70 percent of fatal prescription drug overdoses. Importantly, based on a 2015 national survey of people 12 and older, an estimated 54 percent of respondents who reported misusing prescription pain relievers in the past year obtained their last misused prescription pain reliever from a friend or relative. This issue of prescription misuse and abuse is a costly one with the total costs of prescription drug abuse for public and private healthcare payers—largely the result of emergency room visits, rehabilitation and associated health problems—up to $72.5 billion annually according to the American Journal of Managed Care. 
 Prescription medications, particularly opioids (both ER and immediate-release (“IR”) forms), are prone to being misused or abused through physical and chemical manipulation for the purpose of increasing the speed of the drug release into the bloodstream to accelerate and intensify their effects. A study of prescription opioid abusers in a drug rehabilitation program published in the Journal of Pain & Palliative Care Pharmacotherapy found that 80 percent tampered with opioid tablets to accelerate drug release by chewing or administering the drug intranasally or intravenously. Common methods of manipulating medications in pill or tablet form include crushing in order to swallow, snort or smoke, and dissolving in order to inject. 
 In reaction to this widespread prescription opioid misuse and abuse, the U.S. government and the FDA have established this issue as a high priority. In February 2016, the FDA announced an action plan to combat the growing problem of prescription abuse, highlighting the development of AD formulations as a part of the solution. In addition, according to the CDC, the first line of therapy should be non-opioid treatments, such as NSAIDs. 
 Approved Products SPRIX Nasal Spray
 SPRIX Nasal Spray for short‑term (up to five days) management of moderate to moderately severe pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level
 SPRIX® (ketorolac tromethamine) Nasal Spray is an NSAID indicated in adult patients for the short‑term (up to five days) management of moderate to moderately severe pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level. Formulated as a nasal spray, SPRIX is rapidly absorbed through the nasal mucosa, achieving peak blood levels as fast as an intramuscular injection of ketorolac. SPRIX Nasal Spray has been studied in patients with moderate to moderately severe pain. SPRIX Nasal Spray has demonstrated a 26 to 34 percent reduction in morphine use by patients over a 48‑hour period in a post‑operative setting as compared with placebo. We acquired SPRIX Nasal Spray and certain related assets from Luitpold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Luitpold”) in January 2015 for $7.0 million.

 Commercial Strategy
 Given the issue of prescription opioid abuse and emphasis on prescribing non-narcotic treatments, we believe that SPRIX Nasal Spray, a product that provides opioid-level pain relief, can be an important treatment option for patients with moderate to severe short-term pain. Starting at the end of the first quarter of 2017, a dedicated-SPRIX salesforce of approximately 32 territory managers will be targeting approximately 4,500 healthcare providers. Since the second quarter of 2015, we have been promoting SPRIX to pain prescribers. Going forward, we will be focusing on targeting physicians who have a history of prescribing intramuscular injections of ketorolac and SPRIX. To broaden our reach, since February 2016, we have partnered with Septodont, Inc. (“Septodont”) who has been promoting SPRIX Nasal Spray exclusively to dentists in the United States and Teva has exclusive marketing and commercialization rights to SPRIX Nasal Spray in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank once the product is registered. We are continuing to evaluate other partnership opportunities to bring SPRIX Nasal Spray to other potential specialties that treat patients with short-term pain. OXAYDO
 OXAYDO for the management of acute and chronic pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.
 OXAYDO, the first and only approved IR oxycodone product designed to discourage abuse via snorting, is indicated for the management of acute and chronic moderate to severe pain where an opioid is appropriate. OXAYDO was approved in 2011 prior to the U.S. FDA Guidance for Industry, Abuse-Deterrent Opioids – Evaluation and Labeling (“FDA AD Guidance”) on abuse-deterrent opioids. However, the label does include results from a Category 3 AD study that evaluated drug liking after snorting crushed OXAYDO compared to crushed Roxicodone (oxycodone hydrochloride tablets USP). In September 2016, we announced Category 1 abuse-deterrent data that demonstrated that OXAYDO resists syringeability which could potentially deter abuse through the intravenous route. This data was the basis for an sNDA filed in December 2016 with the FDA. If approved, this could potentially enable us to obtain an abuse-deterrent label for OXAYDO under the FDA AD Guidance. 

OXAYDO is currently available in 5 mg and 7.5 mg doses. In September 2016, a pharmacokinetic study demonstrated bioequivalence (“BE”) of OXAYDO 15 mg to Roxicodone 15 mg. This data served as the basis for a prior approval supplement that was submitted to the FDA in February 2017 to request approval of additional dosage strengths of 10 mg and 15 mg. If approved, we expect these new dosage strengths would be available to market by the second half of 2017. 

We licensed OXAYDO from Acura Pharmaceuticals (“Acura”) in January 2015 for a $5.0 million upfront payment and a $2.5 million milestone payment upon commercial launch. In addition, Acura is entitled to a one-time $12.5 million milestone payment if OXAYDO net sales reach $150.0 million in a calendar year and a tiered royalty of single-digit to double-digit percent based on sales thresholds. 
 Commercial Strategy
 Given the increasing number of IR opioid prescriptions and the high incidence of abuse of IR opioids, OXAYDO has the potential to be an important treatment option. According to the RADAR Systems 2016 study, 98.7 percent of prescription opioid abusers have abused IR opioids. With over 54 million prescriptions of IR oxycodone written in 2016 according to IMS, there is a substantial need for an IR oxycodone product like OXAYDO that is designed to discourage abuse. Since the third quarter of 2015, our sales force has been focused on educating approximately 11,500 physicians in the high‑decile of pain medicine prescribers in the United States on the attributes of OXAYDO. Starting in March 2017, we will be focusing on approximately 6,000 healthcare providers. These healthcare providers were identified as candidates likely to prescribe both OXAYDO and ARYMO ER.

 ARYMO ERARYMO ER for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.
 ARYMO ER is the first approved product developed using our proprietary Guardian Technology creating tablets that are difficult to manipulate for the purpose of misuse and abuse. Results from in vitro testing demonstrated that ARYMO ER tablets, in comparison to non-abuse-deterrent morphine sulfate extended-release tablets, have increased resistance to cutting, crushing, grinding or breaking using a variety of tools. Due to its physical and chemical properties, ARYMO ER is expected to make abuse by injection difficult. ARYMO ER has been approved in three dosage strengths: 15 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg. 
 Commercial Strategy
 Morphine is the most commonly prescribed ER opioid, with nearly 6.4 million prescriptions written in 2016 according to IMS. With more than 98 percent of these prescriptions written for non-abuse-deterrent forms of morphine, we believe that there is a market opportunity for AD morphine like ARYMO ER. We plan to launch ARYMO ER at the end of the first quarter of 2017. We will begin educating approximately 6,000 target healthcare providers about the benefits and risks of ARYMO ER.  Product Candidates
 Our Solution: Guardian Technology
 Overview
 Our proprietary Guardian Technology is a polymer matrix tablet technology that utilizes a novel application of the well-established manufacturing process of injection molding, which results in tablets that are hard and difficult to manipulate for misuse and abuse. This approach offers the ability to design tablets with controlled-release profiles as well as physical and chemical properties that have been demonstrated to resist both common and rigorous methods of manipulation. Tablets manufactured with Guardian Technology have been shown to have increased resistance to physical methods of manipulation, such as cutting, crushing, grinding or breaking using a variety of mechanical and electrical tools. The tablets are also resistant to chemical manipulation and attempts at extraction, and turn into a viscous hydrogel on contact with liquid, making syringeability difficult.
 Our first proprietary product, ARYMO ER, a specialized matrix created through our proprietary manufacturing process, controls the release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) into the blood stream. The matrix, which contains the API as well as inactive agents known as excipients, erodes over time in the gastrointestinal (“GI”) tract, releasing the API. Egalet-002, our current lead product candidate, employs a similar matrix system, however the Egalet-002 tablet is surrounded by a water-impermeable, non-eroding, hard shell containing polylactic acid ("PLA") that creates a cylinder, with the API-containing matrix exposed at both ends. 
 While our Guardian Technology creates a tablet that is extremely hard and has AD features, the construct of the tablet allows for controlled release of the API in the GI tract. Below is a diagram that illustrates the design of Egalet‑002 

 
  6

 
which includes an inner matrix and an outer shell. The tablet’s shell, which is impermeable and remains unchanged, is shown in gray and the matrix containing the API is shown in off-white.

 Our Guardian Technology employs a proven, reproducible, scalable and cost‑efficient manufacturing process. While other pharmaceutical companies typically manufacture their AD products using conventional compression methods, our injection molding technology involves the simultaneous use of both pressure and heat to form tablets using a customized mold. This injection molding technology used to create our matrix and shell is also used in the manufacture of medical devices, including implants and diagnostics, to create the matrix and shell. We believe that we are the first company to combine standard pharmaceutical production with injection molding to produce orally delivered pharmaceutical products.  
 Egalet‑002 for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate
 Overview
 Egalet‑002, an AD, ER, oral oxycodone formulation, is currently in Phase 3 development for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Using our Guardian Technology, we developed Egalet‑002 to address common methods of abuse and misuse, including crushing in order to swallow, snort or smoke, and dissolving in order to inject. In particular, Egalet-002 was specifically designed to address abuse by crushing and snorting, which is the most common method of manipulating oxycodone‑based products for abuse, according to a 2011 article in the Harm Reduction Journal. We plan to seek approval of Egalet‑002 through the FDA’s Section 505(b)(2) approval pathway, using OxyContin as the reference listed drug (“RLD”). In parallel, we are conducting a full set of AD studies in accordance with the FDA AD Guidance, with the goal of obtaining AD claims in Egalet-002’s product label. Because the PK profile of Egalet-002 differs from that of OxyContin, a single Phase 3 efficacy/safety study is being conducted, along with a one-year open-label safety study to assess the long-term exposure of the outer shell component, as required by the FDA.
 Egalet‑002 tablets are designed with an inner matrix, composed of the API and polyethylene oxide (“PEO”), which is surrounded by an outer inert shell composed of PLA and PEO—the physical hardness of the shell and the gelling effect of the matrix combine to give Egalet-002 its AD characteristics. The primary component making up the outer shell, has been used extensively in the medical devices industry, including in the manufacture of implants and diagnostics.
 Product Features of Egalet‑002
 We believe that Egalet‑002, if approved, may provide patients and physicians with the following benefits:

1. | Abuse‑deterrent features: Egalet‑002 was developed to address some of the most common methods of abuse and misuse, including crushing in order to swallow, snort or smoke, and dissolving in order to inject. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Egalet‑002 uses our two‑component system, which is designed to enhance the deterrence of abuse by crushing and snorting in particular, which is the most common method of manipulating oxycodone‑based products for abuse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | PK profile: Egalet‑002 is not bioequivalent to OxyContin and produces less peak‑to‑trough concentration variability in drug exposure. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | No alcohol dose dumping: In a clinical alcohol interaction study, the release of oxycodone from Egalet‑002 was slowed in the presence of increasing concentrations of alcohol demonstrating no evidence of alcohol dose dumping. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Clinical Development
 On July 17, 2013, we submitted an investigational new drug (“IND”) application for Egalet‑002 to the FDA. We plan to seek approval of Egalet‑002 under the FDA’s Section 505(b)(2) approval pathway using OxyContin as the RLD. We have conducted Phase 1 PK trials of Egalet‑002, a battery of Category 1 AD studies comparing Egalet-002 to OxyContin, a clinical alcohol interaction study and a pilot oral abuse potential study with development product. In December 2016, we announced positive results for the primary endpoint of maximum drug liking from our Category 3 intranasal HAP study comparing Egalet-002 to IR oxycodone. We have an ongoing pivotal Phase 3 program which includes a safety and efficacy trial, as well as an open-label, long-term safety study. The Phase 3 studies are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter 2017. The FDA has granted Fast Track status with respect to Egalet‑002. Based on this, and the expected timing of our clinical trials, we anticipate submitting an NDA for Egalet‑002 in 2019. Completed Clinical Trials
 We have performed three Phase 1 clinical trials of Egalet‑002 as part of the formulation development and optimization program. The results of these studies demonstrated that Egalet-002 exhibited different PK characteristics relative to OxyContin. In particular, the plasma concentration of oxycodone after administration of Egalet‑002 had a narrower peak‑to‑trough range than OxyContin, while maintaining a similar range of total concentration, as measured by the area under the curve (“AUC”). These results are represented in the table below as follows: Cmax or peak plasma concentration; Cmin or trough plasma concentration; and the total exposure measured as AUC. These results demonstrate that the PK profile of Egalet‑002 shows less fluctuation in plasma oxycodone concentration.
 | | | | | | | | | | | Percent | 
Steady State | Egalet‑002 | | OxyContin | | improvement | 
Cmin (ng/mL) | | | | 22 | | | | | 18 | | 20 | %
Cmax (ng/mL) | | | | 48 | | | | | 59 | | 23 | %
AUC (ng/hr/mL) | | | | 1008 | | | | | 942 | | N/A | 
[range] | [ | 687 | ‑ | 1519 | ] | [ | 620 | ‑ | 1782 | ] | | 

     
Results from the Phase 1 clinical program also demonstrated dose proportionality of Egalet‑002 across the dosage range of 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg. In addition, one of the PK studies included a fed arm with the highest dose, 80 mg, to assess the food effect of Egalet‑002. A food effect was observed which was consistent with the magnitude of food effect observed in previous OxyContin studies.
 Completed Abuse‑Deterrent Studies
 In accordance with the FDA AD Guidance, we commissioned a third party to conduct Category 1 AD studies of Egalet‑002 to evaluate the physical and chemical properties of Egalet‑002 compared to the AD formulation of OxyContin. These experiments included the full battery of Phase 1 physical manipulations and Phase 2 chemical extractions as referenced in the FDA AD Guidance to fully interrogate the AD properties of Egalet‑002 compared to OxyContin. In one study, five Egalet‑002 tablets and five OxyContin tablets were milled in a coffee grinder, a household tool commonly used to defeat these tablets for recreational use and abuse, for successive rounds of 20 seconds and then 

 
  8

 
placed on a sieve stack with progressively smaller filters to measure the particle size of the ground up tablets. For Egalet‑002, this can either be done with the outer shell intact or with additional effort to try and remove the shell. The result of this Category 1 study with regard to particle size reduction showed that, for Egalet‑002, 12.5 percent of particles were less than 500 microns (suitable for snorting) compared to 74.2 percent of the particles for OxyContin. 
 In December 2016, a randomized, double‑blind, double‑dummy, active and placebo‑controlled, crossover study comparing the abuse potential of manipulated Egalet‑002 versus manipulated IR oxycodone and manipulated OxyContin following intranasal administration in nondependent recreational opioid users was completed. For the primary comparison, the difference in maximum “Drug Liking” (Emax) between manipulated Egalet-002 (79.5 with shell on) was lower compared to crushed IR oxycodone (86.6) at a statistically significant level p = 0.0004. The difference was also statistically significant (p <0.0001) for the comparison between manipulated Egalet-002 (77.4 with shell off) and crushed IR oxycodone (86.6). For the secondary outcome of “Take Drug Again” (measured on a bipolar 100-point scale), the results were 69.9 for manipulated Egalet-002 (with shell on), 72.4 for manipulated Egalet-002 (with shell off), and 75.5 for crushed IR oxycodone which, in each case, was not a statistically significant difference. In the study’s exploratory analysis with OxyContin, “Drug Liking” Emax was similar in all treatment arms, with results of 79.5 for manipulated Egalet-002 (with shell on), 77.4 for manipulated Egalet-002 (with shell off), and 76.2 for manipulated OxyContin. “Ease of Snorting” and “Pleasantness of Snorting” were also assessed using a unipolar 100-point scale where 100 represented 'very easy'/'very pleasant' and 0 represented 'very hard'/'very unpleasant.' Ease of Snorting was harder for manipulated Egalet-002 (42.0 with shell on) and manipulated Egalet-002 (49.5 with shell off) compared to manipulated OxyContin (65.1) at statistically significant levels; (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0050, respectively) and “Pleasantness of Snorting” was lower for manipulated Egalet-002 (40.7 with shell on) and manipulated Egalet-002 (with 44.7 shell off) compared to manipulated OxyContin (55.3) at statistically significant levels as well (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0081, respectively). 
 Ongoing/Planned Clinical Trials and Abuse‑Deterrent Studies

· | A Phase 3, multi‑center, placebo‑controlled, randomized withdrawal trial to assess the analgesic efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Egalet‑002 in both opioid‑experienced and opioid‑naïve patients with chronic moderate to severe low back pain. This trial is currently ongoing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An open-label, long-term safety trial of Egalet‑002 in patients with chronic moderate to severe pain to assess the long-term exposure of Egalet‑002 in patients up to one year. This trial has been completely enrolled and is ongoing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A study comparing the abuse potential of manipulated and intact Egalet‑002 tablets versus manipulated IR oxycodone and manipulated OxyContin following oral administration in nondependent recreational opioid users.

  Additional Product Candidates 
 We have two other product candidates that were developed using our Guardian Technology. We have Egalet-003, an AD stimulant product candidate, and Egalet-004, an AD, ER hydrocodone‑based product candidate for which an initial Phase 1 bioavailability study has been conducted. We are exploring the possibility of further development of these product candidates with a partner.

Our proprietary Guardian Technology platform has the potential to more broadly used with additional types of pharmaceutical products. We believe that the flexibility of our drug delivery systems can be applied to the administration of other classes of APIs, including combination products, where abuse deterrence or a specific release profile is desired. We have developed prototypes, conducted feasibility studies and are exploring additional applications of our technology, both on our own and in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies. 
 Manufacturing
 Overview
 Our approved products are manufactured at contract manufacturing facilities in the United States. We have agreements with UPM Pharmaceuticals to manufacture OXAYDO and Halo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Halo”) to produce ARYMO ER.  Jubilant Hollister Stier (“JHS”) manufactures SPRIX Nasal Spray for us and we purchase our required quantities of SPRIX Nasal Spray through purchase orders with JHS.
 In February 2017, we entered into a manufacturing services agreement with Halo related to the manufacture and supply of ARYMO ER. The agreement has an initial term of five years, and under its terms we are obligated to purchase all of our requirements for ARYMO ER from Halo through 2019 and seventy-five percent of our requirements for the remainder of the term, subject to certain limited exceptions. 
 Our Guardian Technology product candidates are manufactured using our proprietary injection molding process in which the product is molded using pressure and heat. This process is reproducible, scalable and cost‑efficient, and is commonly used in the manufacture of medical devices, including implants and diagnostics. We believe that we are the first company to combine standard pharmaceutical production with plastic injection molding to produce orally delivered pharmaceutical products.
 We also use Halo to produce Egalet-002. To prepare for the commercial launch of ARYMO ER, we expanded the manufacturing capacity and invested in two more injection molding machines at Halo in 2016.
 Drug Substances
 The API used in SPRIX Nasal Spray is ketorolac tromethamine, in OXAYDO is oxycodone hydrochloride, in ARYMO ER is morphine sulfate, and in Egalet‑002 is oxycodone hydrochloride. We currently procure these APIs on a purchase order basis. We acquire ketorolac from a European based manufacturer, while we secure the opioid APIs from a U.S‑based manufacturer, and we may enter into commercial supply agreements with this manufacturer at a later date.
 Both morphine sulfate and oxycodone hydrochloride are classified as narcotic controlled substances under U.S. federal law. OXAYDO and ARYMO ER are classified as Schedule II controlled substances by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), meaning that these substances have the highest potential for abuse and dependence among drugs that are recognized as having an accepted medical use. We expect that Egalet‑002 also will be classified as a Schedule II controlled substance. Consequently, the manufacturing, shipping, dispensing and storing of our products and product candidates are and will be subject to a high degree of regulation, as described in more detail under the caption “Governmental Regulation—DEA Regulation.”
 Intellectual Property
 We regard the protection of patents, designs, trademarks and other proprietary rights that we own as critical to our success and competitive position. As of February 28, 2017, we owned 20 issued patents within the United States, and an additional 95 issued foreign patents covering our product candidates or technology platform. The terms of the issued U.S. patents, extend to various dates between 2022 and 2033. We have acquired two U.S. patents and two pending U.S. patent applications directed to processes of manufacture, devices, and compositions related to SPRIX. We also have an exclusive license to a U.S. patent listed in the Orange Book related to SPRIX Nasal Spray from Recordati S.p.A. that expires in 2018. The term of our overall domestic and foreign patent portfolio related to our ARYMO ER and Egalet‑002 product candidates and our Guardian Technology platform, excluding possible patent extensions, extends to 

 
  10

 
various dates between 2022 and 2033, if pending patent applications in each of our patent families issue as patents.
 We have also licensed six Orange Book listed patents that cover OXAYDO and Acura Pharmaceuticals’ aversion technology which expire between 2023 and 2025.
 As of February 28, 2017, we owned nine pending patent applications under active prosecution in the United States, and an additional 31 pending foreign patent applications covering our product candidates and technology platform. We have one pending patent application in the United States and eleven pending foreign patent applications relating to ARYMO ER. The types of protection that may be afforded by any patents that may issue from these applications include, but are not limited to, composition of matter, process of manufacturing or method of use. Our patents provide protection in jurisdictions that include the United States, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Europe, Eurasia, India, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, China and Japan.
 Our policy is to patent the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business, but only in those cases in which we believe that the costs of obtaining patent protection is justified by the commercial potential of the technology, and typically only in those jurisdictions that we believe present significant commercial opportunities to us. Otherwise, we publish the invention such that it becomes prior art in order for us to secure freedom to operate and to prevent a third party from patenting the invention before us. Our Guardian Technology and products related thereto are not in‑licensed from any third party, and we own all the rights to our product candidates.
 We also rely on trademarks and trade designs to develop and maintain our competitive position. We have trademarks for Egalet Guardian Technology and ARYMO ER in the United States, Canada and the European Union, and SPRIX Nasal Spray in United States and Mexico.
 We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know‑how that is not patentable, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we generally require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information and, in some cases, requiring disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. Additionally, these confidentiality agreements require that our employees, consultants and advisors do not bring to us, or use without proper authorization, any third party’s proprietary technology.
 In accordance with the provisions of Danish law related to inventions of employees, all our employees located in Denmark are under an obligation to assign their rights to an invention to us upon request if the invention is made within the course of their employment by us. Pursuant to this legislation, we may be required to make a compensatory payment to the employee for the right to an invention. To date, we have not received any such claim for compensatory payment from any employee and we do not believe that any employee has any basis for such a claim.
 Research and Development
               Historically, we have devoted a significant amount of resources to develop our product candidates. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, we recorded $22.4 million, $27.1 million and $33.8 million, respectively, in research and development expenses. We will continue to incur research and development expense for the foreseeable future as we continue our efforts to further advance the development of our product candidates, subject to the availability of additional funding. Competition
 Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face competition and potential competition from several sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, generic drug companies, drug delivery companies and academic and research institutions. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates include their degree of abuse deterrence, onset of action, bioavailability, therapeutic efficacy, and convenience of dosing 

 
  11

 
and distribution, as well as their safety, cost and tolerability profiles and our sales and marketing capabilities. Many of our larger potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as more experience in the development of product candidates and the commercialization of products. Consequently, our competitors may develop AD products for the treatment of moderate to severe pain or for other indications we may pursue in the future, and such competitors’ products may be more effective, better tolerated and less costly than our product candidates. Our competitors may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products than we are. We will also face competition in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials.
 In addition to the specific alternatives to our product candidates described below, our product candidates also face competition from commercially available generic and branded long‑acting opioid drugs other than morphine or oxycodone, including fentanyl, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and methadone, as well as opioids that are currently in clinical development.
 SPRIX Nasal Spray
 SPRIX Nasal Spray competes in the short‑term analgesic market which is defined as patients needing therapy for five days or less. There is a high degree of generic competition in this market; however, branded drugs continue to play an important role for patients. There are numerous categories of products in this space and various delivery methods of these analgesics including pills, gels, sprays and injectables. Product categories include NSAIDS such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, celecoxib and ketorolac and IR opioids such as oxycodone, hydrocodone and tapentadol. OXAYDO
 OXAYDO competes against other marketed branded and generic pain therapeutics. Opioid therapeutics generally fall into two classes: codeines, which include oxycodones and hydrocodones, and morphines. OXAYDO is an oxycodone, and competes with therapeutics within both the codeine and morphine classes. These therapeutics include both Schedule II and Schedule III controlled substance products being marketed by companies such as Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc., Mallinckrodt, Pfizer, Purdue, Teva and Actavis, Inc.
 OXAYDO also will compete with a significant number of opioid product candidates under development, including abuse deterrent and tamper resistant formulations of currently available opioids, novel opioids and alternative delivery forms of various opioids under development at other pharmaceutical companies, including single‑entity ER hydrocodone product candidates, which include abuse deterrent formulations, being developed by Pfizer, Purdue and Teva. OXAYDO may also face competition from non‑opioid product candidates including new chemical entities, as well as alternative delivery forms of NSAIDs. These new opioid and non‑opioid product candidates are being developed by companies such as Acura, Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Hospira, Inc., Inspirion Delivery Technologies, LLC, Intellipharmaceutics International Inc., Nektar Therapeutics, Pfizer and QRxPharma Ltd.
 ARYMO ER
 ARYMO ER will compete against branded and generic, long‑ acting morphine products labeled for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. These existing products include Pfizer’s Avinza, Actavis’ Kadian, Purdue’s MS Contin and generic morphine products produced by Actavis, Mallinckrodt, Rhodes Pharmaceuticals, Mylan and Endo. Abuse-deterrent labeling for Pfizer’s Embeda was approved in October 2014 and Embeda was re-launched for commercial availability in 2015. Inspirion Delivery Technologies’ MorphaBond received FDA approval in October of 2015 and it is expected to become commercially available in 2017.
 We believe there are AD morphine products in clinical development by Purdue and Elite. In addition, any company that has developed an AD technology could initiate an AD morphine program at any time.

 
  12

 

 Egalet‑002
 If approved, Egalet‑002 would compete directly against Purdue’s OxyContin for the treatment of patients experiencing moderate to severe pain. Collegium’s XTAMPZA ER was approved in April 2016, Targiniq was approved, but Purdue has withdrawn it from the market and Pfizer’s TROXYCA was approved in August 2016, each of which may compete with Egalet-002 if approved. Although no generic oxycodone products are currently commercially available, it is possible that a generic formulation with AD features could be developed to mirror OxyContin, in which case Egalet‑002 would compete also with any such generic oxycodone products. It is also possible that a company that has developed an AD technology could initiate an abuse‑deterrent oxycodone program at any time.
 Government Regulations
 FDA Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. The FDA approval process can be time consuming and cost intensive and companies may, and often do, re-evaluate the path of a particular product or product candidate at different points in the approval and post-approval process, even deciding, in some cases, to discontinue development of a product candidate or take a product off the market.
 Pharmaceutical product development in the U.S. for a new product or related to changes to an approved product typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre‑market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 A 30‑day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30‑day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or 

 
  13

 
presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (“IRB”) for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit‑risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in some instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. Another scenario which allows for a single Phase 3 efficacy/safety study is via the 505(b)(2) pathway when the investigational product is not bioequivalent to the RLD but can still utilize other safety data from the reference agent for a submission.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,038,000, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $97,000 per product and $512,000 per establishment in 2015. These fees are typically increased annually.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within 10-12 months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. The FDA can extend these reviews by three months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late‑submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but takes into consideration the recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an 

 
  14

 
approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post‑approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Post‑Approval Requirements
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post‑marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality‑control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality‑control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, other regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
 As part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”), imposes certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements and other limitations on the distribution of drug samples to physicians. The PDMA also requires that state licensing of distributors who distribute prescription drugs meet certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling and record keeping. In addition, the PDMA and a growing majority of states also impose certain drug pedigree requirements on the sale and distribution of prescription drugs. The PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations. In 2010, a statutory provision was enacted that required manufacturers and authorized distributors of record to report on an annual basis certain information about prescription drug samples they distributed. The FDA issued a draft compliance policy guide on the reporting requirement. The FDA stated that it would exercise enforcement discretion with regard to companies that have not submitted reports until the FDA finalizes the reporting requirement and/or provides notice that it is revising its exercise of enforcement discretion.
 The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments
 Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through 

 
  15

 
bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method‑of‑use rather than certify to a listed method‑of‑use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earliest of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
 Exclusivity
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (“NCE”), which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA, discussed in more detail below, that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug. A drug may obtain a three‑year period of exclusivity for a change to the drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the labeling or a new formulation, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA, if the supplement includes reports of new clinical studies (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the approval of the supplement.
 An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
 Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness in the approval of a similar product or published literature in support of its application.
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate 

 
  16

 
for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Thus approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non‑patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earliest of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. As with traditional NDAs, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be eligible for three‑year marketing exclusivity, assuming the NDA includes reports of new clinical studies (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the approval of the NDA.
 REMS
 The FDA has the authority to require a REMS to ensure the safe use of the drug. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug.
 In February 2009, the FDA informed drug manufacturers that it will require a REMS for sustained release opioid drug products. Subsequently, the FDA initiated efforts to develop a new standardized REMS for these opioid medications to ensure their safe use. ER formulations of morphine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone would be required to have a REMS. The FDA is also considering whether to have IR opioids join the REMS program.
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA‑regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly‑available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 DEA Regulation
 Our products OXAYDO and ARYMO ER are, and our product candidate, Egalet‑002, if approved, will be regulated as “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (“CSA”), which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.

 
  17

 

 The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule II drugs are those that meet the following characteristics:

· | high potential for abuse;
--+--------------------------


· | currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | abuse may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

  OXAYDO, an IR oxycodone product designed to discourage abuse via snorting and ARYMO ER, an AD, ER morphine product, are each listed by the DEA as a Schedule II controlled substance under the CSA and we expect that Egalet‑ 002, an AD, ER oxycodone product candidate, if approved, will be as well. Consequently, the manufacturing, shipping, storing, selling and using of the products is subject to a high degree of regulation. Schedule II drugs are subject to the strictest requirements for registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting. Also, distribution and dispensing of these drugs are highly regulated. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription. 
 Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
 In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. Any of our products regulated as Schedule II controlled substances will be subject to the DEA’s production and procurement quota scheme. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much morphine and oxycodone may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The limited aggregate number of opioids that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We and our license partners and contract manufacturers must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce or procure any Schedule I or Schedule II substance, including morphine sulfate and oxycodone hydrochloride for use in manufacturing ARYMO ER and Egalet‑002 and OXAYDO respectively. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether to make such adjustments. Our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota of an active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay, limitation or refusal by the DEA in establishing our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
 To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.
 Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our license partners and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products.

 
  18

 

 International Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval and, if applicable, DEA classification. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Many foreign countries are also signatories to the internal drug control treaties and have implemented regulations of controlled substances like those in the United States. Our products will be subject to such regulation which may impose certain regulatory and reporting requirements and restrict sales of these products in those countries.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may apply to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval.
 In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we will be subject to a variety of other foreign regulations governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, pricing and reimbursement and commercial distribution of our products. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with fraud and abuse laws such as the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, as amended and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. These activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on one hand, and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers, on the other. The term “remuneration” is not defined in the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Although there are several statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and 

 
  19

 
safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not meet all the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti‑Kickback Statute liability in all cases. The reach of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute was broadened by the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Additionally, many states have adopted laws like the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, and some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third‑party payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs in at least some cases, and do not contain safe harbors.
 The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third‑party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability based on inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, improper promotion of off‑label uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug’s label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Our activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance. Also, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement about the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain “covered entities,” which are healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), which became effective on February 17, 2010. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” which are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.

 Additionally, new requirements under the federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations require that manufacturers of drugs for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to HHS information related to “payments or other transfers of value” made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals and that manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations report annually to the HHS ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members, with data collection required beginning August 1, 2013, reporting to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), required by March 31, 2014 (and by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year), and disclosure of such information is made on a publicly available website.
 There are also an increasing number of state “sunshine” laws that require manufacturers to file reports with states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities and/or register their sales representatives. Such legislation also prohibits pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing and prohibits certain other sales and marketing practices. In addition, beginning in 2013, a similar federal requirement has required manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians, other healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The federal government will disclose the reported information on a publicly available website. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre‑ marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. With respect to any of our products sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post‑marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti‑fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 Third‑Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
 The commercial success of our products and product candidates, if and when approved, depends and will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third‑party payors at the federal, state and private levels. Third‑party payors include governmental programs such as Medicare or Medicaid as well as commercial healthcare plans and pharmacy benefits managers. These third‑party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third‑party payors will continue to control costs by limiting coverage through the use of formularies and other cost‑containment mechanisms and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments.
 The cost of pharmaceuticals and devices continues to generate substantial governmental and third‑party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Our results of 

 
  21

 
operations and business could be adversely affected by current and future third‑party payor policies as well as healthcare legislative reforms.
 Some third‑party payors also require pre‑approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost‑containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and to operate profitably.
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost‑effective by third‑party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third‑party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been several legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. The Medicare Modernization Act imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand‑alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our current products or product candidates for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non‑governmental payors.
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third‑party payors do not consider our products to be cost‑effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which includes measures to significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are the following:

· | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, that began in 2011;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  22

 


· | an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1 percent and 13 percent of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50 percent point‑of‑sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti‑Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a licensure framework for follow‑on biologic products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | a new Patient‑Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | new requirements under the federal Open Payments program for drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians, effective April 1, 2012;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board which, beginning in 2014, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs and those recommendations could have the effect of law even if Congress does not act on the recommendations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending that began on January 1, 2011.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2 percent per fiscal year, starting in 2013. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and 

 
  23

 
accordingly, our financial operations. It is also uncertain as to whether, and how, the Affordable Care Act and its related rules and regulations may be affected by the new Congress and administration, but the public debate during and following the 2016 campaign may be portend changes that may affect the biopharmaceutical industry in general and the coverage and reimbursement of prescription drugs in particular. In 2017, we may face uncertainties because there likely will be federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. There is no assurance that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business. 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the companies, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Other Regulatory Requirements and Challenges to Regulatory Actions
 We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research and other environmental and safety regulations. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Companies may petition governmental agencies, including the FDA, to discuss or take action with regard to regulatory decisions made relating to a product, product candidate or the company itself. Employees
 As of February 28, 2017, we had 154 employees, of which 135 were employed in the United States and 19 were employed in Denmark. Of our employees, 21 were in research and development, 87 were in sales and marketing and 46 were in administration. Per the Danish Salaried Act, Danish employees have the right to be represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relations to be good.  Available Information
