Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General 
 McDermott International, Inc. (“MDR”), a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Panama in 1959, is a leading provider of integrated engineering, procurement, construction and installation (“EPCI”), front-end engineering and design (“FEED”) and module fabrication services for upstream field developments worldwide.  We deliver fixed and floating production facilities, pipeline installations and subsea systems from concept to commissioning for complex offshore and subsea oil and gas projects. Operating in approximately 20 countries across the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia, our integrated resources include a diversified fleet of marine vessels, fabrication facilities and engineering offices. We support our activities with comprehensive project management and procurement services, while utilizing our fully integrated capabilities in both shallow water and deepwater construction. Our customers include national, major integrated and other oil and gas companies, and we operate in most major offshore oil and gas producing regions throughout the world. We execute our contracts through a variety of methods, principally fixed-price, but also including cost reimbursable, cost-plus, day-rate and unit-rate basis or some combination of those methods. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise indicates, “we,” “us” and “our” mean MDR and its consolidated subsidiaries, and references to any of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II. 
 MDR’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol MDR. 
 Business Segments 
 We report financial results under three reporting segments consisting of (1) the Americas, Europe and Africa (“AEA”), (2) the Middle East (“MEA”) and (3) Asia (“ASA”). We also report certain corporate and other non-operating activities under the heading “Corporate and other.” Corporate and other primarily reflects costs that are not allocated to our operating segments. For financial information about our segments, see Note 19, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
 AEA Segment
 Through our AEA segment, which includes the Americas, Europe and Africa, we serve the needs of customers primarily in the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Trinidad, the North Sea, West Africa and East Africa. Project focus in this segment includes the fabrication and offshore installation of fixed and floating structures and the installation of pipelines and subsea systems. Engineering and procurement services are supported by engineering resources in Chennai, India, Dubai, U.A.E., London, the United Kingdom, Mexico City, Mexico and Houston, Texas. Our primary facilities for this segment are our fabrication facility in Altamira, Mexico and our spoolbase facility in Gulfport, Mississippi. 
 MEA Segment
 Through our MEA segment, which includes the Caspian region, we serve the needs of customers in Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Qatar, Kuwait, Azerbaijan and Russia. Project focus in this segment relates primarily to the fabrication and offshore installation of fixed and floating structures and the installation of pipelines and subsea systems. The majority of our projects in this segment are performed on an EPCI basis. Engineering and procurement services are provided by our Dubai, Chennai, and Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia offices and are supported by additional resources from our Houston office. The primary fabrication facility for this segment is located in Dubai. 
 1


ASA Segment
 Through our ASA segment, we serve the needs of customers primarily in Australia, Indonesia, Brunei, India, Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand. Project focus in this segment includes the fabrication and offshore installation of fixed and floating structures and the installation of pipelines and subsea systems. The majority of our projects in this segment are performed on an EPCI basis. Engineering and procurement services provided by our Kuala Lumpur office in Malaysia are supported by additional resources located in Chennai, Dubai, and Houston. The primary fabrication facility for this segment is located on Batam Island, Indonesia. Through our equity ownership interest in a joint venture, we have access to additional fabrication capacity in China. During 2016, we completed the relocation of our Asia-Pacific headquarter to Kuala Lumpur from Singapore. Now all projects are planned and executed from our Kuala Lumpur office.
 The above-mentioned fabrication facilities in each segment are equipped with a wide variety of heavy-duty construction and fabrication equipment, including cranes, welding equipment, machine tools and robotic and other automated equipment. Project installation is performed by major construction vessels, which we own or lease and are stationed throughout the various regions and provide structural lifting/lowering and pipelay services. These major construction vessels are supported by our multi-function vessels and chartered vessels from third parties to perform a wide array of installation activities that include anchor handling, pipelay, cable/umbilical lay, dive support and hookup/commissioning. See Item 2, “Properties,” in Part I of this Annual Report. 
 Contracts 
 We execute our contracts through a variety of methods, including fixed-price, unit-basis, cost-plus, or some combination of those methods, with fixed-price being the most prevalent. Contracts are usually awarded through a competitive bid process. Factors that customers may consider include price, facility or equipment availability, technical capabilities of equipment and personnel, efficiency, safety record and reputation. 
 Fixed-price contracts are for a fixed amount to cover costs and any profit element for a defined scope of work. Fixed-price contracts entail more risk to us because they require us to predetermine both the quantities of work to be performed and the costs associated with executing the work. See “Risk Factors—We are subject to risks associated with contractual pricing in our industry, including the risk that, if our actual costs exceed the costs we estimate on our fixed-price contracts, our profitability will decline and we may suffer losses” in Item 1A of this Annual Report.
 We have contracts that extend beyond one year. Most of our long-term contracts have provisions for progress payments. We attempt to cover anticipated increases in labor, material and service costs of our long-term contracts either through an estimate of such charges, which is reflected in the original price, or through risk-sharing mechanisms, such as escalation or price adjustments for items such as labor and commodity prices. 
 We generally recognize our contract revenues and related costs on a percentage-of-completion basis. Accordingly, for each contract, we regularly review contract price and cost estimates as the work progresses and reflect adjustments in profit proportionate to the percentage of completion of the related project in the period when we revise those estimates. To the extent these adjustments result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits with respect to a project, we thus recognize a charge against current earnings, which could be material. 
 Our arrangements with customers frequently require us to provide letters of credit, bid and performance bonds or guarantees to secure bids or performance under contracts. While these letters of credit, bonds and guarantees may involve significant dollar amounts, historically there have been no material payments to our customers under these arrangements. 
 Some of our contracts contain provisions that require us to pay liquidated damages if we are responsible for the failure to meet specified contractual milestone dates and the applicable customer asserts a claim under those provisions. Those contracts define the conditions under which our customers may make claims against us for liquidated damages. In many cases in which we have historically had potential exposure for liquidated damages, such damages ultimately were not asserted by our customers.  See Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Change orders, which are a normal and recurring part of our business, can increase (sometimes substantially) the future scope and cost of a job. Therefore, change order awards (although frequently beneficial in the long term) can have the short-term effect of reducing the job percentage of completion and thus the revenues and profits recognized to date. We regularly review contract price and cost estimates as the work progresses and reflect adjustments in profit, proportionate to the job percentage of completion in the period when those estimates are revised. Revenue from unapproved change orders is recognized to the extent of amounts management expects to recover or costs incurred. Unapproved change orders that are disputed by the customer are treated as claims. 
 2


In the event of a contract deferral or cancellation, we generally would be entitled to recover costs incurred, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to deferral or termination. Significant or numerous cancellations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Backlog 
 Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenues we expect to recognize in the future from contracts awarded and those that are in progress. These amounts are presented in U.S. dollars. Currency risk associated with backlog contracts that is not mitigated within the contract is generally mitigated with the use of foreign currency derivative (hedging) instruments, when deemed significant. However, these actions may not eliminate all currency risk exposure included within our long-term contracts. Backlog is a measure not defined by generally accepted accounting principles and is not a measure of contract profitability. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to methodologies used by other companies in determining their backlog amounts. The backlog values we disclose include anticipated revenues associated with: (1) the original contract amounts; (2) change orders for which we have received written confirmations from the applicable customers; (3) change orders for which we expect to receive confirmations in the ordinary course of business; and (4) claims that we have made against our customers. We do not include expected revenues of contracts related to unconsolidated joint ventures in our backlog, except to the extent of any contract awards we may receive from those joint ventures. 
 We include in backlog unapproved change orders for which we expect to receive confirmations in the ordinary course of business, generally to the extent of the lesser of the amounts we expect to recover or the associated costs incurred. Any revenue that would represent profit associated with unapproved change orders is generally excluded from backlog until written confirmation is obtained from the applicable customer. However, consideration is given to our history with the customer, as well as the contractual basis under which we may be operating. Accordingly, in certain cases based on our historical experience in resolving unapproved change orders with a customer, the associated profit may be included in backlog. If an unapproved change order is disputed or rejected by the customer, the associated amount of revenue is treated as a claim. See Note 2, Revenue Recognition, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on unapproved change orders.
 We include claims in backlog only when we have a legal basis to do so, consider collection to be probable and believe we can reliably estimate the ultimate value. Claims revenue is included in backlog to the extent of the lesser of the amounts we expect to recover or associated costs incurred. Claims revenue in backlog at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were not material. 
 Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results, and projects in our backlog may be cancelled, modified or otherwise altered by customers. We can provide no assurance as to the profitability of our contracts reflected in backlog. It is possible that our estimates of profit could increase or decrease based on, among other things, changes in productivity, actual downtime and the resolution of change orders and claims with the customers. 
 The following table summarizes changes to our backlog (in thousands):
 
 
Backlog at December 31, 2015 | $ | 4,231,447

As of December 31, 2016, KJO Hout, an active EPCI project in our MEA segment, was in an $8 million loss position and is expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2017. As of December 31, 2016, total backlog related to that project was $85 million. It is possible that our estimates of gross profit could increase or decrease based on changes in productivity, actual downtime and the resolution of change orders and claims with the customers. See Note 2, Revenue Recognition, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
 Competition 
 We believe we are among the few offshore construction contractors capable of providing a wide range of services in major offshore oil and gas producing regions of the world. We believe that the substantial capital costs and specialized capabilities involved in becoming a full-service offshore EPCI contractor create a significant barrier to entry into the market as a global, fully-integrated competitor. We do, however, face substantial competition from regional competitors and less integrated providers of offshore construction services, such as engineering firms, fabrication facilities, pipelaying companies and shipbuilders. A number of companies compete with us in each of the separate EPCI phases in various parts of the world. Our competitors by segment are discussed below. 
AEA
 Our AEA segment’s key competitors include: Allseas Marine Contractors S.A.; Dragados Offshore Mexico, S.A.; Gulf Island Fabrication Inc.; Swecomex, S.A. DE C.V; Heerema Group; EMAS AMC; KBR, Inc.; Kiewit Corporation; Saipem S.P.A.; Subsea 7 S.A.; Operadora Cicsa S.A. de C.V.; ICA-Fluor Daniel, S. de R.L. de C.V.; Seaway Heavy Lifting Shipping Ltd and TechnipFMC plc. 
MEA
 Our MEA segment’s key competitors include: Hyundai Heavy Industrial Co. Ltd.; Larsen and Toubro Ltd (India); National Petroleum Construction Company (Abu Dhabi); Saipem S.P.A.; TechnipFMC plc.; Offshore Oil Engineering Co., Ltd. and Petrofac International Ltd. 
 ASA
 Our ASA segment’s key competitors include: Allseas Marine Contractors S.A.; China Offshore Oil Engineering Co. Ltd. (COOEC); Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Co. Ltd.; EMAS Group; Heerema Group; Hyundai Heavy Industrial Co. Ltd.; Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Berhad; Nippon Steel Corporation; Saipem S.P.A.; Samsung Heavy Industries Co., Ltd.; SapuraKencana Petroleum & TL Offshore; Sembcorp Marine Offshore Engineering; Subsea 7 S.A./SapuraAcergy; and TechnipFMC plc. 
 Unconsolidated Affiliates
 We participate with third parties in the ownership of certain entities, which we sometimes refer to as “joint ventures,” for convenience of reference.  Those entities are organized in various forms, including as corporations, limited liability companies and other companies with limited liability.  By using the term “joint venture,” we are not implying that those entities constitute general partnerships.  Some of those joint venture entities are not consolidated and are generally accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  We refer to those entities as “unconsolidated affiliates.”  The Unconsolidated affiliates that we consider significant are described below. 
AEA
 io Oil and Gas.  We co-own several joint venture entities with GE Oil & Gas.  These joint venture entities focus on the pre-FEED phases of projects in offshore markets. They bring comprehensive field development expertise and provide technically advanced solutions in new full field development concept selection and evaluation.

ASA
 Qingdao McDermott Wuchuan Offshore Engineering Company Ltd. We co-own this entity with Wuhan Wuchuan Investment Holding Co., Ltd., a leading shipbuilder in China. This joint venture provides project management, procurement, engineering, fabrication, construction and pre-commissioning of onshore and offshore oil and gas structures, including onshore modules, topside, floating, production, storage, and off-loading (“FPSO”) modules and subsea structures and manifolds.
Significant Customers 
 See Note 19, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information on customers that account for significant percentage of our consolidated revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
 Financial Information about Geographic Areas 
 See Note 19, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about our revenues and assets. 
 Raw Materials and Suppliers 
 Our operations use raw materials, such as carbon and alloy steels in various forms and components for assembly. We generally purchase these raw materials and components as needed for individual contracts. We do not depend on a single source of supply for any significant raw materials. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 12,400 persons worldwide. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 3,900 of our employees were members of labor unions.  Some of our operations are subject to union contracts, which we customarily renew periodically. We consider our relationships with our employees and the applicable labor unions to be satisfactory. 
Patents and Licenses 
 We currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and also have certain patent applications pending. We also acquire patents and grant licenses to others when we consider it advantageous for us to do so. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities, skilled personnel, construction and management systems, and the application of know-how, rather than patents and licenses, in the conduct of our business. 
Hazard Risks and Insurance 
 Our operations present risks of injury to or death of people, loss of or damage to property and damage to the environment. We conduct difficult and frequently precise operations in very challenging and dynamic locations. We have created loss control systems to assist us in the identification and treatment of the hazard risks presented by our operations, and we endeavor to make sure these systems are effective. 
 As loss control measures will not always be successful, we seek to establish various means of funding losses and liability related to incidents or occurrences. We primarily seek to do this through contractual protections, including waivers of consequential damages, indemnities, caps on liability, liquidated damage provisions and access to the insurance of other parties. We also procure insurance, operate our own “captive” insurance company or establish funded or unfunded reserves. However, there can be no assurance that these methods will adequately address all risks. 
 Depending on competitive conditions, the nature of the work, industry custom and other factors, we may not be successful in obtaining adequate contractual protection from our customers and other parties against losses and liabilities arising out of or related to the performance of our work. The scope of the protection may be limited, may be subject to conditions and may not be supported by adequate insurance or other means of financing. In addition, we sometimes have difficulty enforcing our contractual rights with others following a material loss. 
 5


Similarly, insurance for certain potential losses or liabilities may not be available or may only be available at a cost or on terms we consider not to be economical. Insurers frequently react to market losses by ceasing to write or severely limiting coverage for certain exposures. Risks that we have frequently found difficult to cost-effectively insure against include, but are not limited to, business interruption (including from the loss of or damage to a vessel), property losses from wind, flood and earthquake events, war and political risks, confiscation or seizure of property (including by act of piracy), pollution liability, liabilities related to occupational health exposures (including asbestos), losses or liability related to acts of terrorism, professional liability, such as errors and omissions coverage, the failure, misuse or unavailability of our information systems or controls or security measures related to those systems, and liability related to risk of loss of our work in progress and customer-owned materials in our care, custody and control. In cases where we place insurance, we are subject to the credit worthiness of the relevant insurer(s), the available limits of the coverage, our retention under the relevant policy, exclusions in the policy and gaps in coverage. 
 Our wholly owned “captive” insurance subsidiary provides coverage for our retentions under employer’s liability, general and products liability, automotive liability and workers’ compensation insurance and, from time to time, builder’s risk and marine hull insurance within certain limits. We may also have business reasons in the future to arrange for our insurance subsidiary to insure other risks which we cannot or do not wish to transfer to outside insurance companies. Premiums charged and reserves related to these insurance programs are based on the facts and circumstances specific to historic losses, loss factors and the performance of the outside insurance market for the type of risk at issue. The actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts. We maintain actuarially determined accruals in our consolidated balance sheets to cover losses in our captive insurance programs. These accruals are based on certain assumptions developed utilizing historical data to project future losses. Loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted as required based upon reported claims, actual claim payments and settlements and claim reserves. These loss estimates and accruals recorded in our financial statements for claims have historically been reasonable. Claims as a result of our operations, if greater in frequency or severity than actuarially predicted, could adversely impact the ability of our captive insurance subsidiary to respond to all claims presented. 
 Additionally, upon the February 22, 2006 effectiveness of the settlement relating to the Chapter 11 proceedings involving several subsidiaries of our former subsidiary The Babcock & Wilcox Company (“B&W”), most of our subsidiaries contributed substantial insurance rights to the asbestos personal injury trust. Those insurance rights provided coverage for, among other things, asbestos and other personal injury claims, subject to the terms and conditions of the policies. With the contribution of those insurance rights to the asbestos personal injury trust, we may have underinsured or uninsured exposure for non-derivative asbestos claims or other personal injury or other claims that would have been insured under those coverages had the insurance rights not been contributed to the asbestos personal injury trust. 
 Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters 
 General 
 Many aspects of our operations and properties are affected by political developments and are subject to both domestic and foreign governmental regulations, including those relating to: 

• | constructing and equipping offshore production platforms and other offshore facilities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | marine vessel safety;
--+----------------------


• | the operation of foreign-flagged vessels in the coastal trade;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | workplace health and safety;
--+-----------------------------


• | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | currency conversions and repatriation;
--+---------------------------------------


• | taxation of foreign earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | protecting the environment.
--+----------------------------

 In addition, we depend on the demand for our offshore construction services from the oil and gas industry and, therefore, are affected by changing taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry generally. The adoption of laws and regulations curtailing offshore exploration and development drilling for oil and gas for environmental, economic and other policy reasons would adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our services. 
 We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. 
 6


The exploration and development of oil and gas properties on the continental shelf of the United States is regulated primarily under the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and related regulations. These laws require the construction, operation and removal of offshore production facilities located on the outer continental shelf of the United States to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications. Similar regulations govern the plugging and abandoning of wells located on the outer continental shelf of the United States and the removal of all production facilities. Violations of regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and related laws can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctions curtailing operations. 
 We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations may affect our future operations. 
 Environmental 
 Our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of increasingly complex and stringent foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances and the health and safety of employees. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws provide for strict, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. In addition, companies may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed. 
 These laws and regulations include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and similar laws that provide for responses to, and liability for, releases of hazardous substances into the environment. These laws and regulations also include similar foreign, state or local counterparts to these federal laws, which regulate air emissions, water discharges and hazardous substances and waste management and disposal, and require public disclosure related to the use of various hazardous substances. Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, including, in the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
 We are currently in the process of investigating and remediating some of our former operating sites. Although we have recorded reserves in connection with certain of these matters, due to the uncertainties associated with environmental remediation, there can be no assurance that the actual costs resulting from these remediation matters will not exceed the recorded reserves. 
 In addition, offshore construction and drilling in some areas have been opposed by environmental groups and, in some areas, have been restricted. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental actions are taken that prohibit or restrict offshore construction and drilling or impose environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general and the offshore construction industry in particular, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. 
 We have been identified as a potentially responsible party at various cleanup sites under CERCLA. CERCLA and other environmental laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any of the potentially responsible parties, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct. Generally, however, where there are multiple responsible parties, a final allocation of costs is made based on the amount and type of wastes disposed of by each party and the number of financially viable parties, although this may not be the case with respect to any particular site. We have not been determined to be a major contributor of wastes to any of these sites. On the basis of our relative contribution of waste to each site, we expect our share of the ultimate liability for the various sites will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any given year. We do not anticipate incurring any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2018. For financial information about our environmental liabilities, see Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

 We believe the items we have outlined above are important factors that could cause estimates in our financial statements to differ materially from actual results and those expressed in a forward-looking statement made in this Annual Report or elsewhere by us or on our behalf. We have discussed many of these factors in more detail elsewhere in this Annual Report. These factors are not necessarily all the factors that could affect us. Unpredictable or unanticipated factors we have not discussed in this Annual Report could also have material adverse effects on actual results of matters that are the subject of our forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update our description of important factors each time a potential important factor arises, except as required by applicable securities laws and regulations. We advise our security holders that they should (1) be aware that factors not referred to above could affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements and (2) use caution and common sense when considering our forward-looking statements.
