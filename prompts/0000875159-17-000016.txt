ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

History
XL Group Ltd, through its subsidiaries, is a global insurance and reinsurance company providing property, casualty and specialty products to industrial, commercial and professional firms, insurance companies and other enterprises on a worldwide basis. 
The Company traces its roots to the merger of insurance company EXEL Limited ("EXEL") and reinsurance company Mid Ocean Limited ("Mid Ocean"), both of which maintained principal operations in Bermuda and were incorporated in the Cayman Islands in 1986 and 1992, respectively. In 1998 EXEL and Mid Ocean merged into a newly formed holding company in the Cayman Islands, EXEL Merger Company, which subsequently changed its named to XL Capital Ltd in February of 1999. Our primary operating company originating from these merged entities is XL Bermuda Ltd ("XLB"), which was formed from the amalgamation of XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd ("XL Re") in May 2016.
In June 1999, XL Capital Ltd acquired NAC Re Corp ("NAC"), a Delaware corporation, in a stock merger; a combination which expanded our reinsurance business within North America. NAC was subsequently renamed XL Reinsurance America Inc. ("XLRA"), and currently serves as pool leader for most of our United States-based insurance and reinsurance operations.
In July 2001, we acquired certain business operations and companies from Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company to extend and complement our predominantly North American-based large corporate insurance business globally.  XL Insurance Company SE (then known as Winterthur International Insurance Company), together with other subsidiaries, absorbed the business operations from this acquisition. XL Insurance Company SE, based in the United Kingdom ("U.K."), serves as one of our principal European insurance platforms.
In September 2003, we completed the last stage of a step acquisition, in which we obtained 100% of French reinsurer Le Mans Re ("Le Mans"), to expand our reinsurance business in Europe. In 2006, we received approval to form a new European company, XL Re Europe Limited (since renamed XL Re Europe SE) based in Dublin, Ireland, which is licensed to write all classes of reinsurance business. XL Re Europe SE, which absorbed the Le Mans operations, serves as one of our principal European reinsurance platforms. 
In August 2006, we completed the sale of approximately 37% of our then financial guarantee reinsurance and insurance businesses through an initial public offering of common shares of Syncora Holdings Ltd ("Syncora") (formerly Security Capital Assurance Ltd or "SCA"). In June 2007, we further reduced our ownership in Syncora to approximately 46% through a secondary offering of Syncora's common shares. In August 2008, we closed an agreement (the "Master Agreement") with Syncora and its subsidiaries, as well as certain counterparties to credit default swap agreements, in connection with the termination of certain reinsurance and other agreements. As part of the Master Agreement, we transferred our remaining ownership interest in Syncora to a trust and, as a result, have had no further ownership interest in Syncora since August 2008.
In July 2010, XL Group plc, a newly formed Irish public limited company ("XL-Ireland"), and XL Capital Ltd (now known as XLIT Ltd.), an exempted company formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands ("XL-Cayman"), completed a redomestication transaction in which all of the ordinary shares of XL-Cayman were exchanged for all of the ordinary shares of XL-Ireland. As a result, XL-Cayman became a wholly-owned subsidiary of XL-Ireland. 
We ceased writing new life reinsurance contracts in 2009 and since that time have been managing the run-off of our life reinsurance operations ("Run-Off Life Operations"). On May 30, 2014, we completed a transaction with GreyCastle Holdings Ltd ("GreyCastle") that resulted in the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary, XL Life Reinsurance (SAC) Ltd ("XLLR"), to GreyCastle (subsequent to the transaction, XLLR changed its name to GreyCastle Life Reinsurance (SAC) Ltd ("GCLR")) and the retrocession of the majority of our life reinsurance business to GCLR through a 100% quota share reinsurance arrangement (the "GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangements"). This transaction covered a substantial portion of our life reinsurance reserves. The designated investments are held by the Company and managed pursuant to agreed upon investment guidelines and are used to support the GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangements on a funds withheld basis ("Life Funds Withheld Assets"). All of the investment results associated with the Life Funds Withheld Assets ultimately accrue to GCLR.
On May 1, 2015 (the "Acquisition Date"), we completed our acquisition (the "Catlin Acquisition") of the entire issued share capital of Catlin Group Ltd ("Catlin") for $4.1 billion in cash and ordinary shares of XL-Ireland, as contemplated by the Implementation Agreement, dated January 9, 2015 (the "Implementation Agreement"), by and among XL-Ireland, Green Holdings Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Green Holdings"), and Catlin, pursuant to which Catlin was merged with and into Green Holdings. Prior to the closing of the Catlin Acquisition, Catlin was a publicly traded company listed on the London Stock Exchange and headquartered in Bermuda. Catlin, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, provided property, casualty and specialty insurance and reinsurance coverage on a worldwide basis. As a result of the Catlin Acquisition, 
1

we have enhanced our global network and business platforms, in particular our presence at Lloyd's, where we are the largest underwriting syndicate. 
Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 include the results of operations of Catlin for the period from May 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. See Item 8, Note 2(e), "Acquisitions and Disposals - Catlin Acquisition," to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information with respect to the Catlin Acquisition.
In July 2016, XL Group Ltd, a newly formed Bermuda exempted company ("XL-Bermuda"), and XL-Ireland completed a redomestication transaction in which all of the ordinary shares of XL-Ireland were exchanged for all of the ordinary shares of XL-Bermuda (the "Redomestication"). As a result, XL-Ireland became a wholly-owned subsidiary of XL-Bermuda. In connection with the Redomestication, XL-Ireland distributed the ordinary shares of XLIT Ltd., XL-Cayman, to XL-Bermuda (the "Distribution"). As a result of the Distribution, XL-Cayman is now a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of XL-Bermuda. It is anticipated that XL-Ireland will be liquidated in 2017. See Item 8, Note 1(a), "Significant Accounting Policies - Basis of Preparation and Consolidation," to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information related to the Redomestication and Distribution.
Prior to July 25, 2016, unless the context otherwise indicates, references herein to the "Company", "we", "us" or "our" are to, and the Consolidated Financial Statements herein include, the accounts of, XL-Ireland and its consolidated subsidiaries. On and subsequent to July 25, 2016, unless the context otherwise indicates, references herein to the "Company", "we", "us" or "our" are to, and the Consolidated Financial Statements herein include, the accounts of, XL-Bermuda and its consolidated subsidiaries.
See further information under Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Segments
We are organized into two operating segments: Insurance and Reinsurance. Our general investment and financing operations, and our Run-Off Life Operations, are reflected in Corporate and Other.
As noted above, GCLR reinsures the majority of our life reinsurance business via the GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangements. This transaction covered a substantial portion of our life reinsurance reserves. See Item 8, Note 2(g), "Acquisitions and Disposals - Sale of Life Reinsurance Subsidiary," to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.
We evaluate the performance of both the Insurance and Reinsurance segments based on underwriting profit. Other items of our revenues and expenditures are not evaluated at the segment level for reporting purposes. In addition, we do not allocate investment assets by segment for our property and casualty ("P&C") operations. Investment assets related to our Run-Off Life Operations, and certain structured products included in our Insurance and Reinsurance segments, are held in separately identified portfolios. As such, net investment income from investment assets is included in the contribution from the applicable segment or, with respect to our Run-Off Life Operations, included in Corporate and Other. While retaining the ability to identify investment assets and their performance between P&C and Run-Off Life operations, the investment portfolio is managed on an aggregate basis. See "Business - Investments" section for further discussion of our portfolio management structure.
The following table sets forth an analysis of gross premiums written by segment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Additional financial information about our segments, including financial information about geographic areas, is included in Item 8, Note 3, "Segment Information," to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

Insurance Segment
General
Our insurance operations are organized as a matrix which pairs our global industry and product expertise with a strong local infrastructure that includes decision makers familiar with local needs and market dynamics. It includes four business groups: Global Casualty, Global Energy, Property & Construction, Global Professional and Global Specialty, as well as four regions: Americas; Europe, Middle East & Africa ("EMEA"); U.K. & Ireland; and Asia Pacific.
Our insurance operations provide customized insurance policies for complex corporate risks that may require large limits, use of a captive insurance company and the need for a global program with locally issued policies. These policies and programs are marketed and distributed through a wide variety of local, national and international producers. Large deductibles and self-insured retentions are incorporated into these policies to further manage risk along with stringent underwriting guidelines. While our insurance operations are known for insuring large complicated risk, certain of our products are targeted to small and midsize companies and organizations, such as our professional liability and program/facility businesses. We focus on lines of business that we believe will provide the best return on capital over time.
The Insurance segment’s most significant operating legal entities in 2016 based on revenues were as follows: XLB, XL Insurance Company SE, XL Specialty Insurance Company, Indian Harbor Insurance Company, Greenwich Insurance Company, XL Insurance America, Inc., Catlin Insurance Company (U.K.) Ltd., as well as Lloyd's Syndicates 2003 and 3002. 
The excess nature of many of our insurance products, coupled with historically large policy limits, results in a book of business that can have losses characterized as low frequency and high severity. As a result, large losses, though infrequent, can have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We attempt to mitigate this risk by, among other things, using strict underwriting guidelines, effective risk management practices (e.g., monitoring of aggregate exposures) and various reinsurance arrangements, as discussed below.
Global Casualty ("Casualty")
Casualty provides primary and excess casualty, environmental liability, excess and surplus lines, US program/facilities and North American construction business. The division writes business on a wholesale basis via our Lloyd's platform and the excess & surplus market in the U.S., and on a retail basis via our global retail network.
With underwriters in the Americas, EMEA, U.K., Ireland and Asia Pacific, Casualty can provide tailored local solutions supported by global expertise and infrastructure. 
Casualty client focus ranges from small business operating in a single location, to the world's largest global corporation with multi-billion dollar businesses. Casualty has a dedicated team providing solution to unique and complex exposures. 
Casualty products generally provide large capacity on a primary or excess of loss basis. Global insurance programs are targeted to large multinational companies in major industry groups including automotive, consumer products, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, high technology, telecommunications, transportation and basic metals. The primary casualty programs and risk management accounts generally require customers to take large deductibles or self-insured retentions. For the excess business, our liability attaches after large deductibles, including self-insurance or insurance layers provided by other companies. Policies are written on an occurrence, claims-made and occurrence reported basis. 
Environmental liability products include pollution and remediation legal liability, general and project-specific pollution and professional liability, and commercial general property redevelopment and contractor’s pollution liability. Business is written for both single and multiple years on a primary or excess of loss, claims-made or, less frequently, occurrence basis. Targeted industries include environmental service firms, contractors, healthcare facilities, manufacturing facilities, real estate development, transportation and construction.
Excess and surplus lines products include general liability, property, excess auto and excess liability coverages where most Insurance Services Office, Inc. ("ISO") products are written. Targets include a variety of classes, with a focus on "one-off" risks generated by contracted wholesale brokers.
Our U.S. program/facilities business specializes in insurance coverages for distinct market segments, including program administrators and managing general agents who operate in a specialized market niche and have unique industry backgrounds or specialized underwriting capabilities. These products encompass mostly P&C coverages.
North America construction products include property coverages (builders risk, contractors equipment, property and inland marine), general liability, U.S. workers' compensation and commercial auto, as well as professional liability for contractors and owners, excess umbrella, subcontractor default insurance, and primary casualty wrap ups.

Global Energy, Property and Construction ("EPC")
Our energy team has a strong presence in wholesale markets such as London and Singapore, in addition to dedicated and experienced teams in retail focused markets in Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East and North America.

Appetite ranges from single location risks to multinational companies with global risks - and cover is available as primary, excess or full value. Products and services include: control of well; drilling contractors; energy casualty; offshore construction projects; and offshore and onshore energy property/business interruption.

Directors’ and officers’ coverage includes primary and excess directors’ and officers’ liability related to both public and private companies as well as financial institutions. Products are targeted at a variety of different sized companies in various industries. 
Employment practices liability is written primarily for very large corporations on an excess of loss basis and covers those firms for legal liability relating to the treatment of employees. Employment practices is written on a primary basis for small private companies on a package basis with other professional coverages.
Errors and omissions coverage is written on a primary and excess basis for professional services firms. Errors and omissions insurance is targeted to small-sized firms and can be written on a primary basis through third parties.
Crime can be written on a stand-alone basis or on a package basis with other professional coverages. Crime is written on a primary and excess basis.

Regions
We serve clients (including members of the Fortune 500, FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40) in more than 200 countries across the world, through our global network of locally licensed and Lloyd's operations, and network partners managed from our three network partner management hubs in Austria, Hong Kong and Mexico.
Our Asia Pacific region operates with a mix of locally licensed and Lloyd's operations, including two representative offices in Japan and India. We have underwriting operations in Hong Kong; Labuan, Malaysia; Melbourne, Australia; Shanghai, China; Singapore; and Sydney, Australia.
Our Americas region operates across Bermuda, Canada, Latin America and the United States. It serves clients and brokers from more than 30 office locations.
Our EMEA region serves clients and brokers from more than 20 offices across Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Our U.K. & Ireland region operates out of six locations: Birmingham, Chelmsford, Dublin, Guernsey, London and Manchester. Our London office is the largest in our global network, reflecting the London market position as the leading international insurance hub. Smaller offices across the U.K. focus on regional U.K. business.
Underwriting
We underwrite and price most risks individually following a review of the exposure and in accordance with our underwriting guidelines. Our insurance operations have underwriting guidelines that are industry-specific. We seek to serve our clients while controlling our exposure both on a portfolio basis and on individual insurance contracts through terms and conditions, policy limits and sublimits, attachment points and facultative and treaty reinsurance arrangements on certain types of risks.
Our underwriters, supported by dedicated teams of claims and pricing actuaries, generally evaluate each industry category and subgroups within each category. Premiums are set and adjusted for an insured based, in large part, on the industry group in which the insured is placed and the perceived risk of the insured relative to the other risks in that group. Rates may vary significantly according to the industry group of the insured as well as the insured’s risk relative to the group. Our rating methodology for individual insureds seeks to set premiums in accordance with claims potential as measured by past experience and future expectations, the attachment point and amount of underlying insurance, the nature and scope of the insured’s operations, exposures to loss, including natural hazard exposures, risk management quality and other specific risk factors relevant in the judgment of our underwriters to the type of business being written.
Underwriting and loss experience is reviewed regularly for, among other things, loss trends, emerging exposures, changes in the regulatory or legal environment as well as the efficacy of policy terms and conditions.
As our insurance products are primarily specialized coverages, underwriting guidelines and policy forms differ by product offering as well as by legal jurisdiction. Liability insurance is written on both a primary and excess of loss basis, on occurrence, occurrence reported and claims-made policy forms. Occurrence reported policies typically cover occurrences causing unexpected and unintended personal injury or property damage to third parties arising from events or conditions that commence at or subsequent to an inception date, or retroactive date, if applicable, and prior to the expiration of the policy provided that proper notice is given during the term of the policy or the discovery period. Claims-made policies typically cover only claims made during the policy period or extended reporting period and are generally associated with professional liability and 
5

environmental coverages. Traditional occurrence coverage is also available for restricted classes of risk and is generally written on a follow-form basis for excess of loss coverage, where the policy adopts the terms, conditions and exclusions of the underlying policy. Property insurance risks are written on a lead or follow-form basis that usually provides coverage for all risks of physical damage and business interruption. Maximum limits are generally subject to sublimits for coverage in critical earthquake and flood zones, where we seek to limit liability in these areas.
Risk Engineering
Included within our Property insurance business is the Property Risk Engineering/GAPS unit, which charges fees for loss prevention and risk engineering consulting services. This includes conducting on-site inspections and consulting services related to loss prevention, reviews of building plans for fire protection design, computer assisted drawings (diagrams) of facilities, recommendations on how to improve site protection, reviews of existing loss prevention reports/information for underwriters, training for clients' internal teams on risk prevention and business continuity, summarizing multiple sources of information into an account summary, and providing underwriters an opinion on the risk to assist with risk selection, pricing and other underwriting decisions. The property engineering team consists of staff located in over 20 countries. Services are offered on a bundled (tied to an insurance contract) as well as unbundled basis.
Other engineering resources support casualty, environmental, specialty and construction lines and serve as internal consultants to their respective underwriting teams, assisting them with making underwriting decisions and providing client support, as well as helping their customers improve their local site or account protection.
Reinsurance Ceded
The purchase of reinsurance protection is centralized to cover both the Insurance and Reinsurance Segments. See "Global Reinsurance Ceded," below, and Item 8, Note 12, "Reinsurance" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information.
Premiums
Premium rates and underwriting terms and conditions for all lines of business written vary by jurisdiction principally due to local market conditions, competitor product offerings and legal requirements.
The following table provides an analysis of gross premiums written, net premiums written and net premiums earned for the Insurance segment by business group for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:

Marketing and Distribution
The majority of business in our Insurance segment originates via a large number of international, national and regional producers, acting as the brokers and representatives of current and prospective policyholders. This channel is supported by our regional teams, which include sales and distribution representatives in key markets throughout the world, representing all of our products in collaboration with the four product divisions. Typically, all such producers receive commission payments for their services, which are calculated as a percentage of the gross premium paid by the policyholder on an account-by-account basis. A certain portion of business originating from producers is submitted on a fee basis under which the producer is compensated by a fee paid to it by its policyholder client. From time to time, we also consider requests from a producer for additional commissions payable by us, with disclosure by the producer to the policyholder-client in accordance with applicable law, where the producer also receives payment from the policyholder-client. 
We consider requests for contingent/additional commission arrangements where such contingent/additional commissions are based upon the volume of bound business originated from a specific producer during a calendar year, or based upon growth of a particular segment of business, where permitted by applicable law and regulation and appropriate. Such arrangements are distinct from program business where additional commissions are generally based on profitability of business submitted to and bound by us.
With regard to excess and surplus lines business, we receive submissions from licensed wholesale surplus lines producers.
We delegate underwriting authority to selected third parties. Those parties with contractually delegated underwriting authority are subject to a financial and operational due diligence review prior to any such delegation of authority and we conduct ongoing reviews and audits as deemed necessary with the goal of assuring the continuing integrity of underwriting and related business operations. 
Apart from compensation arrangements established with producers in connection with insurance transactions, we also have engaged, and may in the future engage, certain producers or their affiliates in consulting roles pursuant to which such producers provide access to certain systems and information and/or additional services that may assist us with our marketing and distribution. In instances where we engage producers in such consulting roles, we may compensate the relevant producers on a fixed fee basis, a variable fee basis based upon our usage of the systems and information proffered, through a combination of fixed and variable fees or in some jurisdictions, where appropriate, on a commission basis.
Claims Administration
Claims management for our insurance operations includes the review of initial loss reports, administration of claims databases, generation of appropriate responses to claims reports, identification and handling of coverage issues, determination of whether further investigation is required and, where appropriate, retention of claims counsel, establishment of reserves for reported claims ("case reserves"), payment of claims and notification to reinsurers. With respect to the establishment of case reserves, our claims personnel record a case reserve as appropriate for the estimated amount of the exposure. The estimate reflects the judgment of claims personnel based on general reserving practices, the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature of the specific claim and, where appropriate, advice of counsel. Reserves are also established to provide for the estimated expense of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process.
Claims in respect of business written by our Lloyd’s syndicates are handled by the "lead" syndicate. Occasionally, on large or complex claims, other syndicates participating in the risk ("following") will participate in the claims handling process. The claims are processed by XChanging, the central market bureau. Where a syndicate is a "lead" syndicate on a Lloyd’s policy, its underwriters and claims adjusters will work directly with the broker or insured on behalf of itself and the other participating or "following" underwriters for any particular claim. This may involve appointing attorneys or loss adjusters. The lead syndicate advises movement in loss reserves to all syndicates participating on the risk. Our claims department may adjust the case reserves it records from those advised by the lead syndicate as deemed necessary.
Certain of our product lines have arrangements with third parties to provide claims handling services to us in respect of such product lines. These agreements set forth the duties of the third parties, limits of authority, protective indemnification language and various procedures that are required to meet statutory compliance. These arrangements are also subject to audit review by our claims department.

Reinsurance Segment
General
Our reinsurance operations are structured into five geographical regions: Bermuda; North America; London; EMEA; and Latin America, Asia Pacific & Credit ("LAC").
This segment provides casualty, property risk, property catastrophe, specialty, and other reinsurance lines on a global basis with business being written on both a proportional and non-proportional treaty basis, and also on a facultative basis. Our lines of business within the Reinsurance segment continue to focus on those that provide the best risk adjusted return on capital. For our Reinsurance segment, challenging market conditions and the changing economic environment experienced since 2008 resulted in a greater emphasis being placed on short-tail lines of business.
Business written on a non-proportional basis generally provides for an indemnification by us to the ceding company for a portion of losses, both individually and in the aggregate, on policies with limits in excess of a specified individual or aggregate loss deductible. For business written on a proportional basis, including on a "quota share" or "surplus" basis, we receive an agreed percentage of the premiums and are liable for the same percentage of each and all incurred losses. For proportional business, the ceding company normally receives a ceding commission for the premiums ceded and may also, under certain circumstances, receive a profit commission based on performance of the contract. Occasionally this commission could be on a sliding scale depending on the loss ratio performance of the contract. 
Our casualty reinsurance includes general liability, professional liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation. Professional liability includes directors’ and officers’, errors and omissions, employment practices, medical malpractice and environmental liability. Casualty lines are written as treaties or programs, and on both a proportional and a non-proportional basis. The treaty business includes clash programs, which cover losses under a number of underlying policies involved in one occurrence or a judgment above an underlying policy’s limit.
Our property business, primarily short-tail in nature, is written on both a portfolio/treaty and individual/facultative basis, and includes property catastrophe, property risk excess of loss and property proportional. A significant portion of the underwritten property business consists of large aggregate exposures to man-made and natural disasters and, generally, loss experience is characterized as low frequency and high severity. This may result in volatility in our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. See Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Significant Items Affecting the Results of Operations." Our crop business, some of which is written on a primary basis, is also reported within the property line of business.
Property catastrophe reinsurance provides coverage on an excess of loss basis when aggregate losses and loss adjustment expenses from a single occurrence of a covered event, or multiple occurrences in the case of aggregate covers, exceed the attachment point specified in the policy. Some of our property catastrophe contracts limit coverage to one occurrence in any single policy year, but most contracts generally enable at least one reinstatement to be purchased by the reinsured. We also write property risk excess of loss reinsurance. Property risk excess of loss reinsurance covers a loss to the reinsured on a single risk of the type reinsured rather than to aggregate losses for all covered risks on a specific event, as is the case with catastrophe reinsurance. Our property proportional account business includes reinsurance of direct property insurance. We seek to limit the catastrophe exposure from our proportional and per risk excess business through extensive use of occurrence and cession limits.
We seek to manage our reinsurance exposures to catastrophic events by limiting the amount of exposure written in each geographic or peril zone worldwide, underwriting in excess of varying attachment points and typically ensuring that contracts exposed to catastrophe loss include aggregate limits. We also seek to protect our total aggregate exposures by peril and zone through the purchase of reinsurance. Our property catastrophe reinsurance account is generally "all risk" in nature. As a result, we are exposed to losses from sources as diverse as hurricanes and other windstorms, earthquakes, freezing, riots, floods, industrial explosions, fires and many other potential natural or man-made disasters. In accordance with market practice, our policies generally exclude certain risks such as war, nuclear contamination or radiation. Following the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center in New York City, Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001 (collectively, "the September 11 event"), terrorism coverage, including nuclear, biological, radiological and chemical, has been restricted or excluded in many territories and classes. Some U.S. states require some coverage for "Fire Following" terrorism and some countries make terrorism coverage mandatory. Our predominant exposure under such coverage is to property damage.
Specialty reinsurance products include energy, marine, aviation and space. Other reinsurance products include fidelity, surety, trade credit, accident and health, mortgage and political risk. In addition, we write several whole account capital gearing quota share contracts on select syndicates at Lloyd's.

The segment’s most significant operating legal entities in 2016 based on revenues were as follows: XLB, XL Re Europe SE, XL Reinsurance America Inc., Catlin Insurance Company Ltd, Catlin Re Switzerland Ltd as well as our Lloyd's syndicates.
Underwriting
Underwriting risks for the reinsurance P&C business are evaluated using a number of factors including, but not limited to, the type and layer of risk to be assumed, the actuarial evaluation of premium adequacy, the cedant’s underwriting and claims experience, the cedant’s financial condition and claims paying rating, the exposure and/or experience with the cedant, and the line of business to be reinsured.
Other factors we assess include the reputation of the proposed cedant, the geographic area in which the cedant does business and its market share, a detailed evaluation of catastrophe and risk exposures, and historical loss data for the cedant, where available, and for the industry as a whole in the relevant regions in order to compare the cedant’s historical loss experience to industry averages. On-site underwriting and claim reviews are performed where it is deemed necessary to determine the quality of a current or prospective cedant’s underwriting operations, with particular emphasis on casualty proportional and working excess of loss placements.
For property catastrophe reinsurance business, our underwriting guidelines generally limit the amount of exposure we will directly underwrite for any one reinsured and the amount of the aggregate exposure to catastrophic losses in any one geographic zone. We believe that we have defined geographic and peril zones such that a single occurrence, for example, an earthquake or hurricane, should not affect more than one peril zone. While the exposure to multiple zones is considered remote for events such as a hurricane, we do manage our aggregate exposures for such a scenario where we consider it appropriate to do so. The definition of our peril zones is subject to periodic review. We also generally seek an attachment point for our property catastrophe reinsurance at a level that is high enough to produce a low frequency of loss. We seek to limit our aggregate exposure in the proportional business through extensive use of occurrence and cession limits.
Reinsurance Retroceded
The purchase of reinsurance protection is centralized to cover both the Insurance and Reinsurance Segments. See "Global Reinsurance Ceded," below, and Item 8, Note 12, "Reinsurance" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information.
We continue to buy additional protection for our property facultative, crop, accident and health, marine and aviation portfolios to manage our net exposures in these classes.

Competition
We compete globally in the P&C reinsurance markets. These markets historically have been cyclical, characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excess underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels. 
As noted above, our reinsurance operations are structured into five geographical regions: Bermuda, North America, London, EMEA and LAC. The main competitors in each of these markets include the following:
Bermuda – Chubb, AXIS, Arch, Endurance, PartnerRe Ltd ("Partner"), RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd ("Ren Re"), Validus Holdings Ltd ("Validus") and alternative asset managers, such as Nephila Capital Limited.
North America – Alleghany Corporation, Arch, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ("Berkshire"), Everest Re Group Ltd ("Everest"), Hannover Re SE ("Hannover Re"), Munich Re AG ("Munich Re"), Partner, and Swiss Re AG ("Swiss Re").
London - Arch, AXIS, Berkshire, Everest, Hannover Re, Lloyd's (including Amlin, Beazley, Hiscox, Kiln and QBE), Munich Re, Partner, SCOR SE ("SCOR"), Swiss Re, Transatlantic Re ("Transatlantic") and Validus.
EMEA - Arch, AXIS, Everest, Hannover Re, Lloyd's, Mapfre, Munich Re, Partner, Ren Re, SCOR, Swiss Re and Validus.
LAC - MS Amlin, Aspen Insurance Holdings Ltd, AXIS, Everest, Hannover Re, Korean Reinsurance Company, Lloyd's, Munich Re, Partner, R+V Versicherung AG, SCOR, Swiss Re and Transatlantic.
Marketing and Distribution
See "Insurance Segment – Marketing and Distribution" above and Item 8, Note 18(a), "Commitments and Contingencies - Concentrations of Credit Risk," to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, for information on our marketing and distribution procedures and information on our major brokers.
Claims Administration
Claims management for the reinsurance operations includes the receipt of loss notifications, review and approval of claims through a claims approval process, establishment of loss reserves for reported claims and approval of loss payments. Case reserves for reported claims are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies with additional case reserves being established when deemed appropriate. Additionally, claims audits are conducted for specific claims and claims procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies, particularly in the U.S. and the U.K.
Corporate and Other (Including Run-Off Life Operations)
Our general investment, financing and administrative operations are reflected in Corporate and Other. In addition, results of our Run-Off Life Operations are reported within "Corporate and Other." We ceased writing new life reinsurance contracts in 2009 and, since that time, have been managing the run-off of our life reinsurance operations.
The majority of our life reinsurance business has been ceded to GCLR through the GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangements. This transaction covers a substantial portion of our life reinsurance reserves. During 2015, we entered into another reinsurance agreement (the "U.S. Term Life Retro Arrangements") ceding the vast majority of the remaining life reinsurance business. At December 31, 2016, gross future policy benefit reserves relating to the Run-Off Life Operations were approximately $3.5 billion, of which we retained approximately $152.2 million ("Run-Off Life Operations - not subject to Life Retro Arrangements") after consideration of the GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangements, U.S. Term Life Retro Arrangements, and all other future policy benefit recoverables, as discussed in Item 8, Note 11, "Future Policy Benefit Reserves," to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.
The Run-Off Life Operations provided life reinsurance on business written by life insurance companies, principally to help them manage mortality, morbidity, survivorship, investment and lapse risks. The products offered included a broad range of underlying lines of life insurance business, including term assurances, group life, critical illness cover, immediate annuities, disability income, and short-term life, accident and health business. The Run-Off Life Operations covered a range of geographic markets, with an emphasis on the U.K., the United States, Ireland and Continental Europe.
Global Reinsurance Ceded
We employ a centrally managed outwards third party reinsurance/risk transfer program to support our underwriting strategy within our risk appetite and to ensure efficient use of our capital.  Reinsurance ceded varies by location and line of business based on a number of factors, including market conditions. Reinsurance ceded does not legally discharge us from our liabilities to the original policyholder in respect of the risk being reinsured.
10

The goals of our outwards reinsurance/risk transfer program include reducing exposure on individual risks, protecting against catastrophic risks, maintaining acceptable capital ratios and enabling the writing of additional business.  The overall goal of the program is to reduce volatility and enhance the overall capital efficiency of the Company. 
We use reinsurance to underpin the underwriting and retention guidelines of our subsidiaries as well as to control our aggregate exposure to a particular risk or class of risks. Reinsurance is purchased at several levels ranging from reinsurance of risks assumed on individual contracts to reinsurance covering the aggregate exposure on a portfolio of policies issued by groups of companies and to capital provision through several strategic third-party capital arrangements.
Our underwriting portfolio includes a material portion that is exposed to loss from catastrophic events or other correlated exposures. The risk of a large aggregation of such losses poses one of the most substantial risks that we face.  We monitor exposure to catastrophic events and aggregation of other materially correlated losses.  This exposure is modeled and managed to ensure alignment with our approved risk appetite.
This exposure is further protected by a risk transfer program that responds to an array of possible catastrophic events.  This program employs a variety of risk transfer mechanisms to assist in managing our net retention to an acceptable level. It is structured in various layers and in excess of varying attachment points according to the different businesses and territories exposed. We have co-reinsurance retentions within this program. In addition, we cede catastrophe excess of loss business on a proportional basis to certain unrelated companies as well as one affiliated company that in turn distributes the risk to non-affiliated third party investors.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses
Loss reserves are established due to the significant periods of time that may lapse between the occurrence, reporting and payment of a loss. To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and loss expenses, we estimate future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events. Our reserving practices and the establishment of any particular reserve reflect our judgment concerning sound financial practice and do not represent any admission of liability with respect to any claim. Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves are established for reported claims ("case reserves") and incurred but not reported ("IBNR") claims. The nature of our high excess of loss liability and catastrophe business can result in loss payments that are both irregular and significant. Similarly, adjustments to reserves for individual years can be irregular and significant. Such adjustments are part of the normal course of business for us. Certain aspects of our business have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity. This may result in volatility in our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. An analysis of our P&C operations paid, unpaid and incurred losses and loss expenses, including a reconciliation of beginning and ending unpaid losses and loss expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is included in Item 8, Note 10, "Losses and Loss Expenses."
Our net unpaid losses and loss expenses relating to our operating segments at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

(U.S. dollars in thousands) | 2016 | | 2015
Insurance | $ | 13,743,090 | | | $ | 13,652,129
Reinsurance | 6,716,181 | | | 6,538,710 | 
Net unpaid losses and loss expenses | $ | 20,459,271 | | | $ | 20,190,839

Investments
Investment structure and strategy
Our investment strategy is based on a Strategic Asset Allocation ("SAA") process that establishes a strategic benchmark, which is a portfolio asset allocation target that is constructed to maximize enterprise value subject to business constraints and the risk tolerance of the Company’s management and approved by the Risk and Finance Committee of the XL-Bermuda Board of Directors (the "RFC"). The primary objective of our investment strategy is to maximize the risk adjusted return on capital employed subject to a variety of constraints including: maintaining adequate regulatory capitalization; maintaining sufficient liquidity to ensure payment of claims, operating expenses and other obligations even during stressed scenarios; and to generate stable net investment income.
The investment portfolio is managed by the team of investment professionals led by our Chief Investment Officer (the "Investment Group") which has operations in Bermuda, Hong Kong, India, Switzerland and the U.S. The Investment Group is responsible for the entire value chain of the investment process including SAA, construction of portfolios including risk management and definition of guidelines, in-house management of certain asset classes, and selection and oversight of external asset managers.
11

The RFC is appointed by the board of directors of XL-Bermuda (the "Board") to assist in fulfilling the Board’s oversight responsibilities relating to the financial affairs of the Company, as well as the Company’s management of enterprise-wide key risks. Among its responsibilities in relation to investments, the RFC:

• | reviews and approves the overall investment policies for the management of the Company’s investment portfolio, investment portfolio guidelines, the SAA framework, including setting appropriate risk tolerance levels and tactical allocation parameters, and overall investment benchmarks;


• | oversees compliance with the above investment portfolio policies and approves exceptions to such policies from time to time; and


• | reviews the Company’s investment performance against the approved benchmarks as well as other key investment performance metrics.

Our investment strategy is supported by in-house capabilities to manage certain asset classes including high quality fixed income assets and private investments (including funds), across the capital structure.
Our investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities, equities, hedge funds, private investments (including funds), derivatives, other investments and cash and cash equivalents. These securities and investments are denominated in U.S. dollars, British Pound, Euros, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars and other foreign currencies.
Our direct use of investment derivatives includes futures, forwards, swaps and options that derive their value from underlying assets, indices, reference rates or a combination of these factors. Our current investment policy allows derivatives to be used in the investment portfolio to reduce risk or enhance portfolio efficiency. Derivatives may not be used if they materially increase our investment risk.
Life Funds Withheld Assets
The Life Funds Withheld Assets are managed pursuant to agreed upon investment guidelines that meet the contractual commitments of our ceding companies and applicable laws and regulations. All of the investment results associated with the Life Funds Withheld Assets ultimately accrue to GCLR. Because we no longer share in the risks and rewards of the underlying performance of the supporting invested assets, we separate the Life Funds Withheld Assets from the rest of our investments. The remaining discussion in this section therefore excludes the Life Funds Withheld Assets.
Strategic Asset Allocation and Authorities Framework
The foundation of our investment strategy is the SAA process, which establishes a benchmark ("SAA Benchmark") that is constructed to maximize enterprise value, subject to various considerations and constraints, including the liability profile, business needs, collateral management, as well as liquidity and regulatory requirements. It is subject to the risk tolerance of management, and is approved at least annually by the RFC on behalf of the Board.
The SAA process involves an integrated, stochastic model that includes our financial condition, reserve volatility and loss payout patterns, premium expense and loss ratio projections and correlations among assets, liabilities and economic variables such as inflation.
As part of the implementation of our SAA Benchmark, we employ a comprehensive framework of investment decision authorities ("Authorities Framework"). The objective of the Authorities Framework is to ensure that the risk profile of our investment portfolio is consistent with management’s risk tolerance as reflected in the SAA Benchmark. The Authorities Framework controls active or tactical deviations from the SAA Benchmark. As the magnitude of these deviations increases or the resulting impact on the risk profile of the investment portfolio reaches certain predetermined thresholds, additional levels of authority and approval are required, up to and including the RFC.
See Item 8, Note 2(e), "Acquisitions and Disposals - Catlin Acquisition," to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information with respect to the Catlin Acquisition.
Implementation of investment strategy
Day-to-day management of our investment portfolio is conducted through a combination of in-house portfolio management teams and external asset managers, in accordance with detailed investment guidelines and risk tolerances that are closely monitored by the Investment Group. This hybrid implementation approach provides us with access to external asset managers with specialized skills across a broad range of investment products, as well as the flexibility to actively manage the overall structure of the portfolio in line with our specific business needs. Interaction between our internal and external managers provides additional insight to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves.
External asset managers are selected on the basis of various criteria including investment style, track record, performance, risk management capabilities, internal controls, operational risk management and diversification implications. The vast 
12

majority of our investment portfolio is managed by large, well-established asset management institutions, while a small portion of the portfolio is managed by asset management specialist firms or boutiques. Each asset manager may manage one or more portfolios, each of which is governed by a detailed set of investment guidelines, including overall objectives, risk limits (where appropriate) and diversification requirements that collectively fall within our overall investment policies and guidelines. 
We have been an active investor in alternative asset classes for many years - principally hedge fund strategies, and to an increasing extent, private investments (including funds). We have dedicated teams focused on private investments (including funds) and value investing, which pursue a concentrated portfolio of primarily corporate investments across the capital structure. We believe alternative strategies have an important role to play in both our SAA, as well as active or tactical deployments when compelling market opportunities arise. We will pursue these opportunities, as they arise, to take advantage of our balance sheet capacity to invest with a longer-term horizon, capture illiquidity premium and generally benefit from market dislocations.
 Most of our investments in alternative asset classes are sourced directly by teams within the Investment Group, who perform the initial screening and due diligence as well as the ongoing monitoring of such investments. Occasionally, we may work with third-party allocators who have a particular expertise in a sub-sector of alternative strategies to gain exposure to that subsector.
Investment risk management
The Investment Group employs what we believe is a prudent and risk-conscious investment approach and operates within a comprehensive Authorities Framework which defines limits within which the underlying investment portfolios must be managed. This is supplemented by robust compliance monitoring with defined escalation and notification procedures. This framework is designed to identify investment risks in absolute and relative terms, and to consistently and objectively measure, assess, manage and report such risks on an ongoing basis.
Investment risk management is achieved through the regular review of market and credit risk analytics that incorporate distribution-based risk measures such as value-at-risk, scenario and stress testing and portfolio sensitivities to a broad range of risk factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, equities, foreign exchange risk, hedge funds, etc. The investment risk management process forms an integral part of the group’s enterprise risk management ("ERM") framework to ensure a fully integrated view of market, credit, liquidity and concentration risks.
The Company’s policy is to operate the fixed income portfolio with a minimum weighted average credit rating of Aa3/AA-. The aggregate credit rating is determined based on the weighted average rating of securities, where the average credit rating, where available, from Standard & Poor’s ("S&P"), Moody’s Investors Service ("Moody’s") and Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") is allocated to each security. The weighted average credit rating of the aggregate fixed income portfolio was AA as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. U.S. agencies paper and Agency Residential Mortgage Backed Securities ("RMBS"), whether with implicit or explicit government support, reflect the credit quality rating of the U.S. government for the purpose of these calculations.
See Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for a discussion of risk management activities as they relate to the investment portfolio.
Investment performance
See Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Investment Performance," for a discussion of our investment performance.
Enterprise Risk Management
Risk Management Framework
We face strategic and operational risks related to, among others matters: underwriting activities, financial reporting, changing macroeconomic conditions, investment risks, reserving estimates, changes in laws or regulations, information systems, business interruption and fraud. Our global P&C business, Run-Off Life Operations and investment portfolios each have their own set of risks (see Item 1A, "Risk Factors," for a discussion of such risks). At times these risks may exhibit greater levels of correlation than might be expected over the longer term due to the presence of, to a greater or lesser degree, some common internal or external risk drivers embedded in our businesses that may manifest themselves simultaneously. An enterprise view of risk is required to identify and manage the consequences of these common risks and risk drivers on our profitability, capital strength and liquidity.
Our ERM initiatives are led by the Chief Enterprise Risk Officer ("CERO"), who is a member of executive management and who reports to our Chief Financial Officer. The CERO also acts as a liaison between our Enterprise Risk Committee 
13

("ERC," discussed below) and the Board (or its committees), with respect to risk matters. All of our employees are expected to assist in the appropriate and timely identification and management of risks and to enhance the quality and effectiveness of ERM.
Our ERM framework is designed to allow us to identify and understand material risk concentrations, including concentrations that have unattractive risk/reward dynamics so that prompt, appropriate, corrective or mitigating actions can be taken. To do this, we have established risk management committees and processes to serve as points of managerial dialogue and convergence across our businesses and functional areas, to create risk aggregation methodologies, to develop specific risk appetites and to coordinate the identification, vetting and discussion of risk topics and metrics. As part of our ERM activities, we apply a suite of stress tests, tools, risk indicators, metrics and reporting processes that examine the consequences of low probability/high severity events (including those related to emerging risks) in order to take mitigating actions where required.
Risk Governance
Risk governance relates to the processes by which oversight and decision-making authorities with respect to risks are granted to individuals within the enterprise. Our governance framework establishes accountabilities for tasks and outcomes as well as escalation criteria. Governance processes are designed to ensure that transactions and activities, individually and in the aggregate, are carried out in accordance with our risk policies, philosophies, appetites, limits and risk concentrations, and in a manner consistent with expectations of excellence, integrity, accountability and client service.
With respect to the responsibilities relating to ERM, the RFC:

• | Oversees ERM activities, including the risk management framework employed by management. With respect to the overall risk management framework, the RFC (i) reviews the methodology for establishing our overall risk capacity; (ii) reviews the policies for the establishment of risk limit frameworks, and adherence to such limits; and (iii) reviews and approves enterprise risk limits.


• | Oversees our compliance with any significant enterprise risk limits, authorities and policies. The RFC evaluates what actions to take with respect to such enterprise limits, authorities and policies, and approves any exceptions thereto from time to time as necessary.


• | Reviews our overall risk profile and monitors key risks across our organization as a whole, which may involve coordination with other committees of the Board from time to time as appropriate.


• | Reviews our process controls over model use and development with respect to model risk and model effectiveness, accuracy, and propriety.


• | Monitors our risk management performance and obtains reasonable assurance from management that our risk management policies are effective and are being adhered to.

The review of our overall risk appetites and the evaluation of the risk impact of any material strategic decision being contemplated, including consideration of whether such strategic decision is within the risk profile established by us, is conducted by the full Board. "Risk appetites," as referred to above, are broad statements used to guide our risk and reward preferences over time, all consistent with, among other factors, business prudence, market opportunities, the underwriting pricing cycle and investment climate. Risk appetites are regularly monitored and can change over time in light of the above. See "Risk Appetite Management" below.
Management oversight of ERM is performed, in part, via a centralized management ERC, which is chaired by the CERO. The ERC is comprised of senior management from our businesses and functions and is charged with developing and monitoring enterprise risk policies, risk appetites, risk limits (and compliance with such limits) and risk aggregations, and identifying key emerging risks and ways to mitigate such risks.
14

We have also established subcommittees of the ERC, each focusing on particular aspects of ERM. These subcommittees include:

• | Asset Risk Committee: This subcommittee assists the ERC in its responsibilities in relation to governance and oversight of asset-related risks across the Company, including the investment portfolio. Among its activities are (a) involvement in policy decisions on modeling and quantification of risk measurements; and (b) providing an interpretation and assessment of asset-related risks, with a particular focus on market-related risks. Further, the subcommittee is responsible for coordinating on a regular basis with the Credit Risk Committee on asset-related credit risks.


• | Country Risk Committee: This subcommittee supports and assists the ERC's identification, measurement, management, monitoring and reporting of country risk to our underwriting activities and functional areas.


• | Credit Risk Committee: This subcommittee develops and implements the metrics and supporting framework for allocation of credit risk capacity across major business units and functions, including the amount and types of credit exposure.


• | Economic Capital Model Committee: This subcommittee oversees the development of economic capital models that support ERM activities, and helps set priorities and manage resources related to such models. It reviews assumptions and related methodologies used within our economic capital models, including assessments of model validation, model control and model risk.


• | Liability Risk Committee: This subcommittee supports and assists the ERC’s identification, measurement, management, monitoring and reporting of key underwriting liability and emerging risks.


• | Model Validation Committee: This subcommittee supports ERC's independent validation of the capital model, and ensuring that it is fit for purpose, by providing oversight over the independent validation of the capital model. 


• | Operational Risk Committee: This subcommittee supports the ERC’s identification, measurement, management and oversight of key operational risks through its oversight of key operational risk management processes and through its review of related operational risk indicators, trends and metrics.

In addition to the above, risk management committees within our segments and certain business functions help ensure that risk is managed in accordance with the risk limits, guidelines and tolerances that we have allocated to them.
Risk Appetite Management
Our risk appetite framework guides our strategies relating to, among other things, capital preservation, earnings volatility, capital at risk, operational loss, liquidity standards, claims paying rating and capital structure. This framework also addresses our tolerance to risks from material individual events (e.g., natural or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism), our investment portfolio and realistic disaster scenarios that cross multiple lines of business (and risks related to some or all of the above that may occur concurrently).
In relation to event risk management, we establish net underwriting limits for individual large events as follows:

1. | We impose limits for each natural catastrophe peril region at a 1% tail value at risk ("TVaR") probability. This statistic indicates the average amount of net loss expected to be incurred if a loss above the 1% exceedance probability level has occurred.


2. | For each event type other than natural catastrophes, we impose limits at a 1% exceedance probability. If we were to deploy the full limit, for any given event type, there would be a 1% probability that an event would occur during the next year that would result in a net underwriting loss in excess of the limit.


3. | We also impose limits for certain other event types at a 0.4% exceedance probability as described in further detail below. If we were to deploy the full limit, for any such given event type, there would be a 0.4% probability that an event would occur during the next year that would result in a net underwriting loss in excess of the limit.

For planning purposes and to calibrate 2017 risk tolerances, we set our underwriting limits as a percentage of September 30, 2016 adjusted tangible capital ("Adjusted Tangible Capital"). Adjusted Tangible Capital is defined as Total Shareholders’ Equity plus (i) outstanding subordinated notes due 2025 and 2045, less (ii) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, less (iii) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("AOCI") (excluding certain net balances associated with Life Funds Withheld 
15

Assets). These limits may be recalibrated, from time to time, to reflect material changes in Total Shareholders’ Equity that may occur, at the discretion of management and as overseen by the Board.
Tiered risk tolerances are set for natural catastrophes, terrorism, other realistic disaster scenarios, credit risk, country risk, longevity risk and mortality risk. In setting our risk tolerances we consider such factors as:

• | Anticipated risk adjusted returns;


• | Strategic risk preferences;


• | Relativity to peers;


• | Shareholder expectations;


• | Robustness of exposure assessment methodology; and


• | Projected enterprise loss potential.

Per event 1% TVaR underwriting limits for North Atlantic Windstorm are set at a level not to exceed approximately 25% of Adjusted Tangible Capital. Per event 1% TVaR underwriting limits for North American Earthquake are set at a level not to exceed approximately 20% of Adjusted Tangible Capital. Per event 1% TVaR underwriting limits for all other natural catastrophe peril regions are set below the per event 1% TVaR limits described above.
The largest per event 1% exceedance probability underwriting limit for terrorism and other realistic disaster scenarios is set at a level not to exceed approximately 13.5% of Adjusted Tangible Capital; limits at the per event 1% exceedance probability for the remaining terrorism and realistic disaster scenarios are set below this level. 
The largest per event 1% exceedance probability underwriting limit for country risk is set at a level not to exceed approximately 8.9% of Adjusted Tangible Capital. 
The largest per event 1% exceedance probability underwriting limit for mortality risk is set at a level not to exceed approximately 6.1% of Adjusted Tangible Capital. 
The largest per event 1% exceedance probability underwriting limit for longevity risk is set at a level not to exceed approximately 1.5% of Adjusted Tangible Capital.
The largest per event 0.4% exceedance probability underwriting limit for certain terrorism events is set at a level not to exceed approximately 18% of Adjusted Tangible Capital; limits at the per event 0.4% exceedance probability for the remaining terrorism event scenarios are set below this level.
The largest per event 0.4% exceedance probability underwriting limit for mortality risk is set at a level not to exceed approximately 8.1% of Adjusted Tangible Capital.
The largest per event 0.4% exceedance probability underwriting limit for longevity risk is set at a level not to exceed approximately 2.0% of Adjusted Tangible Capital.
In all instances, the above referenced underwriting limits reflect pre-tax losses net of reinsurance and include inwards and outwards reinstatement premiums related to the specific events being measured. The limits do not contemplate underwriting profits expected to be generated in the absence of catastrophic loss activity.
In setting underwriting limits, we also consider such factors as:

• | Correlation of underwriting risk with other risks (e.g., asset/investment risk, operational risk, etc.);


• | Model risk and robustness of data;


• | Geographical concentrations;


• | Exposures at lower return periods;


• | Expected payback period associated with losses;


• | Projected share of industry loss; and


• | Annual aggregate losses for natural catastrophes at various return periods, including a 1% exceedance probability and a 1% TVaR level on both a peril region basis and a portfolio basis.

Also see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Credit Risk (Excluding Life Funds Withheld Assets)," for a discussion of our credit risk framework, which establishes a credit clash limit to manage the direct and 
16

indirect credit exposures arising from underwriting and non-underwriting activities that could potentially be impacted in various degrees by a systemic credit event.
Loss exposure estimates for all event risks are derived from a combination of commercially available and internally developed models together with the judgment of management, as overseen by the Board. Actual incurred losses may vary materially from our estimates. Factors that can cause a deviation between estimated and actual incurred losses may include:

• | Inaccurate assumptions of event frequency and severity;


• | Inaccurate or incomplete data;


• | Changing climate conditions that may add to the unpredictability of frequency and severity of natural catastrophes in certain parts of the world and create additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures;


• | Future possible increases in property values and the effects of inflation that may increase the severity of catastrophic events to levels above the modeled levels;


• | Natural catastrophe models that incorporate and are critically dependent on meteorological, seismological and other earth science assumptions and related statistical relationships that may not be representative of prevailing conditions and risks, and may therefore misstate how particular events actually materialize, causing a material deviation between forecasted and actual damages associated with such events; and


• | A change in the legislative, regulatory and judicial climate.

For the above and other reasons, the incidence, timing and severity of catastrophes and other event types are inherently unpredictable and it is difficult to estimate the amount of loss any given occurrence will generate. As a consequence, there is material uncertainty around our ability to measure exposures associated with individual events and combinations of events. This uncertainty can cause actual exposures and losses to deviate from those amounts estimated, which in turn can create a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and may result in substantial liquidation of investments, possibly at a loss, and outflows of cash as losses are paid. For this reason, we carry capital in addition to that required by the specific limits described above even if it is in excess of rating agency and regulatory required capital. 
For a further discussion on risk appetite management see Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Other Key Focuses of Management."
Impact of ERM Processes
We believe that our ERM processes improve the quality and timeliness of strategic decisions, enhance the integration of strategic initiatives with the risks related to such initiatives and act as catalysts to improve risk awareness and informed action by us. We believe that the integration of ERM with existing business processes and controls optimizes the risk/reward characteristics of business strategies, enhances our overall risk management culture, and is central to our capital allocation process.
In addition, our ERM processes complement our overall internal control framework by helping us to manage an organization of our size and the variety of our businesses, investment activities and geographical reach. However, internal controls and ERM can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that control objectives will be met. As a result, the possibility of material financial loss remains in spite of our ERM activities. An investor should carefully consider the risks and all information set forth in this report including the discussion included in Item 1A, "Risk Factors," Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk," and Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Regulation 
Our (re)insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision in each of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to conduct business. The degree and type of regulation to which we are subject may vary substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, regulatory authorities have broad supervisory and administrative powers within their jurisdiction over matters such as licenses, approval of directors or management, standards of solvency, governance, risk management, local intermediary requirements, premium rates, policy forms, investments, security deposits, methods of accounting, form and content of financial statements, reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, claims handling, reinsurance, minimum capital and surplus requirements and/or risk based capital standards, dividends and other distributions to shareholders, periodic examinations and annual and other report filings or notifications. See Item 8, Note 24, "Statutory Financial Data," to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.
The violation of regulatory requirements may result in the loss of applicable licenses, fines, censures or criminal sanctions. Changes to regulations to which our operations are subject could impact our business, results or operations, cash flows or 
17

financial condition. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors – The regulatory regimes under which we operate, and potential changes thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our business." 
A summary of certain key regulatory considerations applicable to XL-Bermuda and its material (re)insurance subsidiaries follows.
 Group Supervision 
The Bermuda Monetary Authority (the “BMA”) became our group supervisor following the completion of our redomestication to Bermuda from Ireland in July 2016. The BMA has designated our BMA-regulated (re)insurance subsidiary XLB as the Company's “designated insurer.” Under the group supervision regime, both the Company as the holding company and XLB as the designated insurer are subject to obligations and requirements. As the designated insurer, XLB’s role is to facilitate and maintain the Company's compliance with group supervision rules.The specific duties of the designated insurer include reporting obligations, the establishment of key group functions, and notification to the BMA of material changes, certain specified events generally related to impairment to the Company’s financial condition or compliance breaches, the appointment of auditors and actuaries and matters related to the Company’s financial condition.
The BMA’s group supervision rules cover matters such as an assessment of a group’s financial condition and solvency, its system of governance and risk management, supervisory reporting and disclosures, capital and solvency reporting requirements and capital requirements. 
The BMA requires the Company to maintain available statutory capital and surplus at a level equal to or in excess of its enhanced capital requirement ("ECR"). The applicable ECR is established by reference to either the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement ("BSCR"), which employs an economic balance sheet model, or a BMA-approved internal capital model. The BMA has also established a target capital level ("TCL") applicable to Bermuda insurance groups equal to 120% of ECR. We are required to prepare and submit annual filings to the BMA regarding our financial position, including an annual group statutory financial return and a group capital and solvency return. The BMA’s group rules also require the preparation of an annual Group Solvency Self-Assessment which, among other things, requires us to ensure capital is adequate to cover risks across the Company. We are also required to publish a Financial Condition Report for the Company which, amongst other things, provides details of the governance, solvency and financial performance of the Group.
XL-Bermuda has applied to the BMA for approval of its internal capital model. If the BMA approves our internal model, XL-Bermuda’s ECR will be calculated using the internal capital model.
The European Commission has determined the BMA’s group supervision rules to be fully equivalent to Solvency II and the UK Prudential Regulatory Authority (the ”PRA”) relies on the group supervision exercised by the BMA. 
Bermuda
The Company’s Bermuda (re)insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the BMA. The Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and related rules and regulations, as amended (the "Bermuda Act"), regulate those subsidiaries, which are registered with the BMA and licensed as Class 4 (XLB), Class 3A (Catlin Insurance Company Ltd) Class D (XL Life Ltd) or Class E (XLB) (re)insurers. The Bermuda Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards, certain restrictions on the declaration and payment of dividends and distributions, certain restrictions on the reduction of statutory capital, and auditing and reporting requirements, and grants the BMA powers to supervise and, in certain circumstances, to investigate and intervene in the affairs of (re)insurance companies.
We have two companies in Bermuda, Vector Reinsurance Ltd. and Hubble Re Ltd., licensed as Special Purpose Insurers (“SPIs”). SPIs are licensed to write special purpose business, which is insurance business under which an insurer fully funds its liabilities to the persons insured. SPIs are required to file with the BMA annual statutory financial statements but are not required to file an annual loss reserve specialist opinion. The BMA has the discretion to modify such SPIs' accounting requirements under the Bermuda Act.
Solvency and Capital Requirements
Our Bermuda (re)insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain available statutory capital and surplus at a level equal to or in excess of their enhanced capital requirement ("ECR"). The applicable ECR is established by reference to either the BSCR or a BMA-approved internal capital model. The BMA has also established a target capital level ("TCL") for each (re)insurer equal to 120% of its ECR. 
While (re)insurers are not required to maintain their statutory capital and surplus at this level, the TCL acts as an early warning tool for the BMA and failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the TCL will likely result in increased BMA regulatory oversight. Our Bermuda (re)insurance subsidiaries currently use the BSCR model to calculate their solvency requirements. Each Bermuda (re)insurance subsidiary is also required to maintain a minimum margin of solvency whereby its business assets are required to exceed its business liabilities by a statutorily prescribed amount.
18

Restrictions on Dividends, Distributions and Reduction of Capital
Under the Bermuda Companies Act 1981, as amended, a Bermuda company may not declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of contributed surplus if there are reasonable grounds for believing that: (a) the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or (b) the realizable value of the company’s assets would thereby be less than its liabilities. Under the Bermuda Act, Class 4, Class 3A, Class D and Class E (re)insurers are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus as shown on its previous financial year’s statutory balance sheet unless it certifies to the BMA that it will continue to meet its minimum solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio. In addition, neither Class 4 nor Class 3A (re)insurers nor certain long-term (re)insurers may reduce their total statutory capital as set out in their previous financial year’s financial statements by 15% or more unless they have received the prior approval from the BMA. See Item 8, Note 24, "Statutory Financial Data," to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, for further information.
Reporting Requirements
Each Class 4, Class 3A, Class D and Class E (re)insurer is required to file with the BMA an annual statutory financial return which includes statutory financial statements (including a statutory economic balance sheet), an actuarial opinion and a statutory declaration of compliance), a capital and solvency return report and audited consolidated financial statements. Each must also file with the BMA annual audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP") or International Financial Reporting Standards. There is also a requirement for each (re)insurer to prepare an annual Commercial Insurer’s Solvency Self Assessment which, among other things, assesses each (re)insurer’s required capital resources to meet its business objectives and to file with the BMA and publish on its website a financial condition report. 
Insurance Code of Conduct
Our Bermuda (re)insurance subsidiaries are required to comply with the BMA's Insurance Code of Conduct, which establishes duties, requirements and standards to ensure each (re)insurer implements sound corporate governance, risk management and internal controls. Non-compliance with the BMA’s Insurance Code of Conduct could result in intervention by the BMA.
United States
X.L. America, Inc. is a Delaware domiciled holding company for our wholly owned U.S. (re)insurance subsidiaries: XL Reinsurance America Inc., Greenwich Insurance Company, Indian Harbor Insurance Company, XL Insurance America, Inc., XL Insurance Company of New York, Inc., XL Select Insurance Company, XL Specialty Insurance Company, Catlin Specialty Insurance Company, Catlin Indemnity Company, Catlin Insurance Company, Inc. and T.H.E. Insurance Company. Our U.S. (re)insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, including our respective domiciliary states of New York, Delaware, Texas and Louisiana, as applicable.
As members of an insurance holding company system, our U.S. (re)insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance holding company system laws and regulations. As such, notice to applicable domiciliary insurance departments is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the ownership or control of a (re)insurer and of certain material transactions between a (re)insurer and an entity in its holding company system, and certain transactions may not be consummated without the applicable insurance department’s prior approval.
Risk-Based Capital
State insurance laws subject our U.S. (re)insurance subsidiaries to risk based capital requirements (“RBC”) implemented by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"), an organization of U.S. state insurance regulators. The NAIC uses a risk based capital formula that is designed to measure the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a (re)insurer to support its business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. These requirements provide a formula for (re)insurers to establish risk based capital across key areas of risk. The RBC system supplements the state statutory minimum capital and policyholder surplus requirements.
Dividends and Distributions
Our U.S. (re)insurance subsidiaries also are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions that limit the amount of dividends that may be paid from earned surplus without prior approval from regulatory authorities. These restrictions differ by state, but are generally based on a calculation of the lesser of 10% of statutory surplus or 100% of "adjusted net investment income" to the extent that it has not previously been distributed. 
19

Reporting Requirements 
Our U.S. (re)insurance subsidiaries currently are required to file detailed annual and, in most states, quarterly reports with insurance regulators in each of the states in which they are domiciled, licensed or accredited. In addition, these subsidiaries’ operations and accounts are subject to financial condition and market conduct examinations at regular intervals by state insurance regulators. 
IRIS Ratio Requirements
The NAIC has developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System ("IRIS") to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of U.S. (re)insurance companies and identifying companies requiring special attention or action. IRIS identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio. A ratio that falls outside the usual range is not necessarily considered adverse. 
Federal Regulation
Historically, the federal government's involvement in the insurance industry was limited to certain insurance products, such as flood insurance, multi-peril crop insurance and reinsurance of losses from terrorism under the U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (“TRIA”). TRIA was enacted in 2002 to ensure the availability of insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts in the U.S. and has been reauthorized three times since its enactment and is now in effect through December 31, 2020. 
In July 2010, the U.S. federal government's oversight of the insurance industry was expanded under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank"). Dodd-Frank set forth a framework for a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry in the U.S. and established a Federal Insurance Office within the Treasury Department that is focused on monitoring the insurance sector and representing the US internationally on prudential insurance matters.
The European Union
Our (re)insurance subsidiaries located within the European Union, including XL Insurance Company SE (“XLICSE”), XL Re Europe SE, Catlin Insurance Company (UK) Ltd (“CICL”) and Catlin Underwriting Agency Ltd on behalf of various Lloyd’s syndicates (“CUAL”), currently are required to comply with Solvency II requirements. The objective of Solvency II is to establish a solvency system that is matched to (re)insurers’ risks to enable supervisors to protect policyholders' interests in accordance with common principles across the E.U. 
Solvency II groups requirements according to three "pillars." Pillar 1 addresses financial and capital requirements; pillar 2 addresses governance and supervision and risk management requirements; and pillar 3 addresses reporting and disclosure requirements. 
United Kingdom
Our U.K. (re)insurance subsidiaries XLICSE, CICL and CUAL are regulated by the PRA, which regulates (re)insurers’ key aspects of (re)insurers' financial strength, and the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates (re)insurers' conduct.
XLICSE, CICL and CUAL are able to operate throughout the European Union, which is commonly referred to as passporting. These subsidiaries have authorization to write insurance business either on a cross-border basis into other member states of the E.U. or through the establishment of a branch office within another E.U. member state (this may require compliance with certain additional local regulatory requirements in respect of the branch). XLICSE has E.U. branches in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden. It also has branches in Switzerland, Hong Kong and Singapore that are subject to local regulation. The future ability of XLICSE, CICL and CUAL to passport into the E.U. could be adversely affected by the U.K.’s referendum vote to leave the E.U. and the future regulatory regime that may be applicable to these operations is uncertain. See Item 1A., “Risk Factors - Recent developments relating to the U.K.’s referendum vote in favor of withdrawing from the E.U. (“Brexit”) could adversely affect us”.
The PRA and the FCA set a number of specific requirements for governance, risk management and accountability, including in respect of Senior Insurance Management Regime (SIMR) and systems and controls, which place a strong emphasis on effective governance and risk identification and mitigation.
Solvency & Capital Requirements 
XLICSE’s and CICL’s minimum capital and solvency requirements are calculated using the Solvency II standard formula.
Dividends and Distributions
U.K. company law prohibits our U.K. (re)insurance subsidiaries from declaring a dividend to its shareholders unless it has "profits available for distribution." The determination of whether a company has profits available for distribution is based on its 
20

accumulated realized profits less its accumulated realized losses. While the U.K. insurance regulatory laws impose no statutory restrictions on a general insurer's ability to declare a dividend, the PRA controls the maintenance of each insurance company's solvency margin within its jurisdiction. The PRA's rules require notification to the PRA of any proposed or actual payment of a dividend. Any such payment or proposal could result in regulatory intervention.
Reporting Requirements
Our U.K. (re)insurance subsidiaries must prepare their financial statements under the Companies Act 2006 (as amended), which requires the filing with Companies House of audited financial statements and related reports. Each of our U.K. (re)insurance subsidiaries is required to prepare and submit an annual submission of quantitative reporting templates ("QRTs") as well as a triennial narrative Regular Supervisory Report, together with audited annual financial statements and an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (which assesses current and future risks to determine capital is adequate). In addition, the PRA requires the publication of a Solvency and Financial Condition Report.
Lloyd’s Operations
Our Lloyd’s business is conducted through our managing agent - CUAL. CUAL is regulated by the Council of Lloyd’s (in addition to the PRA and FCA) and manages a number of syndicates. A syndicate is comprised of one or more members that underwrite (re)insurance risks with each syndicate being managed by a managing agent. Managing agents write (re)insurance business on behalf of the member(s) of the syndicate, and the member(s) receive profits or bear losses in proportion to their share in the syndicate for each underwriting year of account.
The Council of Lloyd’s has broad rule-making and enforcement powers to manage the Lloyd’s market. The rules set by the Council, among other matters, prescribe membership subscription, the level of contribution to the Lloyd’s New Central Fund and the assets that must be deposited with Lloyd’s in support of underwriting, known as “funds at Lloyd’s”. The Lloyd’s Central Fund is available to satisfy claims if a member of Lloyd’s is unable to meet its insurance obligations, and Lloyd’s requires every member of Lloyd’s to contribute a prescribed amount to the Lloyd’s Central Fund annually. Fund’s at Lloyd’s requirements are similar in effect to a required solvency margin. Lloyd’s syndicates are required to use a Solvency II compliant internal model to calculate solvency capital requirements. CUAL is required to submit annually a business plan for each syndicate, which is subject to review and approval by Lloyd’s.
Ireland
XL Re Europe SE is a company incorporated in Ireland and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (“CBI”) as a reinsurer. The Insurance Supervision Directorate of the CBI is responsible for the prudential supervision of (re)insurance undertakings authorized in Ireland. It has powers to administer a broad range of sanctions in response to breaches of regulation or conditions of authorization including fines, cautions or reprimands, revocation or suspension of authorization and/or disqualification of senior managers.
Solvency Requirements
XL Re Europe SE is supervised under Solvency II and its minimum capital and solvency requirements are calculated using the Solvency II standard model.
Reporting Requirements 
Pursuant to the Companies Act 2014, XL Re Europe SE is required to file QRTs, including audited financial statements, with the Companies Registration Office in Dublin. Certain changes to reported information must also be filed with the Companies Registration Office during the year as they arise.
Dividends and Distributions
XL Re Europe SE can only declare dividends out of “profits available for distribution,” which are accumulated, realized profits, less accumulated, realized losses, as determined by reference to the last audited or interim accounts.
Branch Network
XL Re Europe SE has branches in the U.K., France, Switzerland and Dubai. The CBI’s supervision of XL Re Europe SE extends to business pursued through its European/European Economic Area ("EEA") branches or via passporting in the E.U./EEA, subject to any requirements imposed by the regulator of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located. The CBI is responsible for notifying other E.U./EEA states of an Irish (re)insurer’s intention to operate in their jurisdiction. 
The Swiss branch of XL Re Europe SE is not subject to supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (“FINMA”). 
The Dubai branch is licensed to operate as an Authorized Firm for Non-Life insurance business and is regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority.
21

Switzerland
Our Swiss (re)insurance subsidiaries Catlin Re Switzerland Ltd, XL Re Latin America Ltd and XL Insurance Switzerland Ltd (in run-off), as well as the Zurich branch of XL Insurance Company SE, London, are subject to regulation and supervision in Switzerland. Swiss insurance regulation is set forth in the Swiss Insurance Supervision Act of 2004 (ISA), as amended from time to time and the Swiss Insurance Supervision Ordinance of 2005, as amended from time to time.
Supervision of our Swiss (re)insurance subsidiaries is carried out by FINMA. FINMA’s supervisory tasks encompass authorization, supervision and, where necessary, enforcement of supervisory law. FINMA may also regulate activities where it is authorized to do so. 
Solvency & Capital Requirements
FINMA’s supervisory regime is called the "Swiss Solvency Test," which imposes capital requirements on our Swiss (re)insurance subsidiaries, and also includes reporting requirements. In addition, our Swiss subsidiaries that write direct insurance have to comply with "tied assets" requirements. The Swiss supervisory regime has been assessed as Solvency II equivalent. 
Dividends and Distributions
Our Swiss (re)insurance subsidiaries may only distribute dividends out of their retained earnings or distributable reserves, based on the entity’s last audited annual accounts. In addition, FINMA must approve all such dividend distributions.
Reporting Requirements
In addition to the Swiss-Solvency Test-related reporting noted above, each of our Swiss (re)insurance subsidiaries is subject to annual reporting requirements. These requirements include the filing of an annual management report that includes the entity’s annual accounts and consolidated accounts for the group and an annual supervisory report that includes details on solvency margins, technical provisions, lines of business, type of reinsurance treaties, geographical information, details on investments categories and other information. Our Swiss (re)insurance subsidiaries are also required to maintain business plans, any changes to which must be approved by FINMA. 
Other International Operations
We have a number of (re)insurance subsidiaries that operate in jurisdiction other than those discussed above, including in the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions. We also (re)insure risks in many countries pursuant to regulatory permissions and exemptions available to non-admitted (re)insurers.
Asia Pacific
We do business across the Asia Pacific region, including in Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, Labuan and China, through a combination of (re)insurance subsidiaries, branch offices and Lloyd’s service companies in Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and Labuan. Our Singapore service company and branches are regulated, respectively, by Lloyd’s Asia and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Our Australian service company holds an Australian Financial Services License and is regulated by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. The Australia branch of XLICSE is regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority. As for Hong Kong, the service company underwriters must be registered with the Insurance Agents Registration Board, while the Hong Kong branch of XLICSE is directly regulated by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance, which will become the Independent Insurance Authority in 2017. Finally, in Labuan we have a service company and branch of XLICSE, both of which are regulated by the Labuan Financial Services Authority.
Our Chinese regulated insurance subsidiary, XL Insurance Company China Limited, is regulated by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (the "CIRC") under the People’s Republic of China Insurance Law. To carry on (re)insurance business in a foreign currency, the company is also subject to licensing and foreign currency exchange control by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. We also participate in the Chinese market as the XL Catlin Underwriting Division of Lloyd’s Insurance Company (China) Limited, which is also regulated by the CIRC.
Latin America
We have both insurance and reinsurance operations in the Latin American region, with local companies writing business in Brazil and Mexico. Our Mexican and Brazilian (re)insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the National Commission of Insurance and Surety and the Superintendência de Seguros Privados, respectively. We also act as a foreign reinsurer in almost all Latin-American countries. We are admitted reinsurers in different countries through different reinsurance companies across the region. While the extent and type of regulation to which we are subject varies from country to country in which we conduct business, each country typically has regulations relating to solvency, auditing, internal controls and financial reporting. 
22

Other Regulatory Considerations
We continue to monitor and assess regulatory initiatives and legislation around the world that may impact us in the future. We have focused closely on Solvency II, which became effective on January 1, 2016. We are actively monitoring and engaging on the proposed regulatory framework being developed by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) for internationally active insurance groups (“IAIGs”), including the design of a new risk-based global capital standard, and we are also monitoring the development of systemic risk regulation.
