ITEM 1. | Business

General
We focus on providing cleaner, lower carbon products and services. We are North America's largest producer of advanced biofuels. We utilize a nationwide production, distribution and logistics system as part of an integrated value chain model designed to convert natural fats, oils and greases into advanced biofuels. During 2017, we sold 587 million total gallons of fuel (including fuel purchased from third parties for resale) and generated revenues of $2.2 billion. We are also engaged in research and development efforts focused on the conversion of diverse feedstocks into various renewable chemicals, advanced biofuels 
1

and other products. We believe our fully integrated approach, which includes acquiring feedstock, managing biorefinery facility construction and upgrades, operating biorefineries, and distributing through a network of terminals, positions us to serve the market for biomass-based diesel, other advanced biofuels and other products and services.
Plant Network
We own and operate a network of 14 biorefineries. Twelve biorefineries are located in the United States and two in Germany. Twelve biorefineries produce traditional biodiesel, one produces renewable diesel (“RD”), and one is a microbial fermentation facility used in connection with our development of renewable chemicals. Our thirteen biomass-based diesel production facilities have an aggregate nameplate production capacity of 520 million gallons per year ("mmgy"). 
Our development-stage industrial biotechnology business, REG Life Sciences is developing proprietary microbial fermentation processes to produce renewable chemicals, advanced biofuels and other products. Fatty acids are one of three product areas being focused on, along with esters and alcohols. 
In January 2017, we completed the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in Petrotec AG. Our operations in Germany utilize used cooking oil and other waste feedstocks to produce biomass-based diesel at our two biorefineries in Emden and Oeding, Germany. Our nameplate production capacity in Germany is approximately 50 mmgy.

We maintain a testing laboratory at our corporate headquarters in Ames, Iowa, for testing various feedstocks for conversion into biomass-based diesel and various new manufacturing processes for the production of biomass-based diesel. We also have a regional office in Tulsa, Oklahoma, focused on maintaining and developing advanced biofuel technologies and renewable chemicals. Our industrial biotechnology research and development activities, conducted in South San Francisco, are dedicated to the development of renewable chemicals, advanced biofuels and other products using our proprietary microbial fermentation technology. 
Our Feedstocks and Other Inputs
We are a lower-cost biomass-based diesel producer. We primarily produce our biomass-based diesel from a wide variety of lower cost feedstocks, including inedible corn oil, used cooking oil and inedible animal fat. We also produce biomass-based diesel from virgin vegetable oils, such as soybean oil or canola oil, which are more widely available, but tend to be higher in price. We believe our ability to process a wide variety of feedstocks provides us with a cost advantage over many biomass-based diesel producers, particularly those that rely primarily on higher cost virgin vegetable oils.
Our ability to use a wide range of feedstocks gives us the flexibility to respond to changes in feedstock pricing to maintain our feedstock cost advantage. We have the ability to adjust our processing to accommodate different feedstocks and feedstock mixes. In 2017, approximately 73% of our total feedstock usage was lower cost inedible corn oil, used cooking oil or rendered animal fat feedstock and the remaining 27% consisted of refined vegetable oils, such as soybean oil or canola oil. 
We procure our feedstocks from numerous vendors in quantities ranging from truckload to railcar to water vessel to pipeline. There is no established futures market for the lower cost feedstocks that we utilize. Inedible corn oil is typically purchased in forward positions of one to three months, and occasionally longer, on fixed priced contracts. We generally purchase used cooking oil and rendered animal fats on one to four week forward positions using fixed pricing or an indexed price compared to a published index such as USDA reports or recognized industry price reports such as The Jacobsen or Informa. Soybean and canola oils can be purchased on a spot or forward contract basis from a number of suppliers and pricing for these vegetable oils is compared to the broadly traded Soybean Oil Index of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
From time to time, we work with developers of next generation feedstocks, such as algae and camelina, to assist them in bringing these new feedstocks to market. We have converted several of these feedstocks, as well as other second generation 
3

feedstocks, into high quality biomass-based diesel in our laboratory and production facilities. We believe we are well positioned to incorporate many new feedstocks into our production process as they become commercially available.
We procure methanol and chemical catalysts used in our production process such as sodium methylate and hydrochloric acid, under fixed-price contracts and formula-indexed contracts based upon competitive bidding. These procurement contracts typically last from three months to one year. The price of methanol is indexed to the monthly reported published price such as the JJ&A Methanol report or Southern Chemical report.
Distribution
We have established a national distribution system to supply biomass-based diesel throughout the United States. Each of our biomass-based diesel facilities is equipped with an on-site rail loading system, a truck loading system, or both. Our Seneca biorefinery near the Illinois River has direct barge access for supplying customers using the inland waterways system. Our Houston biorefinery has barge and deep-water ship loading capability. Our Grays Harbor biorefinery has deep-water capability for PANAMAX class vessels. We also manage some customers’ biomass-based diesel storage tanks and replenishment process. Our distribution performance for 2017 is depicted below.
We lease over 500 railcars for transportation and lease biomass-based diesel storage tanks in 46 terminals as of December 31, 2017. In general, the terminals where we lease our biomass-based diesel storage tanks are petroleum fuel terminals so that fuel distributors and other biomass-based diesel customers can create a biomass-based diesel blend at the terminal before further distribution. Terminal contracts typically have one- to three-year terms and are generally renewable subject to certain terms and conditions. During 2017, REG sold products in 48 states in the U.S., five Canadian Provinces, Mexico and additional countries in Europe, South America and Asia.
We also sell petroleum-based heating oil and diesel fuel, which enables us to offer additional biofuel blends, while expanding our customer base. We sell heating oil and ultra-low sulfur diesel ("ULSD") at terminals throughout the northeastern U.S. as well as BioHeat® blended fuel at one of our existing Northeastern terminal locations. We sell additional biofuel blends to terminal locations in the Midwest, West Coast and Texas. We continue to look for terminal expansion opportunities across North America.
Government Programs Favoring Biomass-Based Diesel Production and Use
The biomass-based diesel industry benefits from numerous federal and state government programs, the most important of which is Renewable Fuel Standard ("RFS2").
4

Renewable Fuel Standard
On July 1, 2010, RFS2’s biomass-based diesel requirement became effective, requiring for the first time that a certain percentage of the diesel fuel consumed in the United States be made from renewable sources. The biomass-based diesel requirement can be satisfied by two primary fuels, biodiesel and renewable diesel. Required volumes under the RFS2 program, referred to as the renewable volume obligation ("RVO"), are determined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, subject to the approval of the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB. For 2012 through 2016, the biomass-based diesel RVO was set (in gallons) at one billion, 1.28 billion, 1.63 billion, 1.73 billion, and 1.90 billion for 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. In November 2016, the EPA issued the final biomass-based diesel RVO volume for 2017 at 2.00 billion gallons. In November 2017, the EPA issued the final biomass-based diesel volume for 2018 at 2.1 billion gallons and set the 2019 RVO volume target at 2.1 billion gallons.
The biomass-based diesel requirement is one of four separate renewable fuel requirements under RFS2. The RFS2 requirements are based on two primary categories and two subcategories. The two primary categories are conventional renewable fuel, which is primarily satisfied by corn ethanol, and advanced biofuel, which is defined as a biofuel that reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% compared to the petroleum-based fuel the biofuel is replacing. The advanced biofuel category has two subcategories, cellulosic biofuel, to be satisfied by newly developed cellulosic biofuels, such as ethanol made from woody biomass, and biomass-based diesel, which is satisfied by biodiesel and renewable diesel. RFS2’s total advanced biofuel requirement is larger than the combined cellulosic fuel and biomass-based diesel requirements, thus requiring the use of additional volumes of advanced biofuels.
The RFS2 requirement for advanced biofuels can be satisfied by any advanced biofuel, including biodiesel, renewable diesel, biogas used in transportation, biobutanol, cellulosic ethanol or sugarcane-based ethanol, so long as it meets the 50% greenhouse gas reduction requirement. The advanced biofuel requirement was 2.88 billion gallons in 2015, 3.61 billion gallons in 2016, 4.28 billion gallons in 2017 and 4.29 billion gallons in 2018.
The advanced biofuel RVO is expressed in terms of ethanol equivalent volumes, or EEV, which is based on the fuel’s renewable energy content compared to ethanol. Biodiesel has an EEV of 1.5 and renewable diesel has an EEV of 1.5-1.7, compared to 1.0 for sugarcane-based ethanol. Accordingly, it requires less biomass-based diesel than sugarcane-based ethanol to meet the required volumes as each gallon of biomass-based diesel counts as more gallons for purposes of fulfilling the advanced biofuel RVO, providing an incentive for refiners and importers to purchase biomass-based diesel to meet their advanced biofuel RVO.
The RFS2 volume requirements apply to petroleum refiners and petroleum fuel importers in the 48 contiguous states and Hawaii, who are defined as “Obligated Parties” in the RFS2 regulations, and require these Obligated Parties to incorporate into their petroleum-based fuel a certain percentage of renewable fuel or purchase credits in the form of renewable identification numbers ("RINs") from those who do. An Obligated Party’s RVO is based on the volume of petroleum-based fuel they produce or import. The largest United States petroleum refining companies, such as Valero, Phillips 66, ExxonMobil, British Petroleum, Chevron, Shell, Marathon and Citgo, represent the majority of the total RVO, with the remainder made up of smaller refiners and importers.
Renewable Identification Numbers
The EPA created the RIN system to track renewable fuel production and compliance with the renewable fuel standard. EPA registered producers of renewable fuel may generate RINs for each gallon of renewable fuel they produce. In the case of biomass-based diesel, generally 1.5 to 1.7 biomass-based diesel RINs may be generated for each gallon of biomass-based diesel produced, based upon the fuel's renewable energy content. Renewable fuel, including biomass-based diesel, can then be sold with associated RINs attached. RINs may also be separated from the gallons of renewable fuel they represent and once separated they may be sold as a separate commodity. RINs are ultimately used by Obligated Parties to demonstrate compliance with RFS2. Obligated Parties must obtain and retire the required number of RINs to satisfy their RVO during a particular compliance period. An Obligated Party can obtain RINs by buying renewable fuels with RINs attached, buying RINs that have been separated, or producing renewable fuels themselves. All RIN activity under RFS2 must be entered into the EPA’s moderated transaction system, which tracks RIN generation, transfer and retirement. RINs are retired when used for compliance with the RFS2 requirements.
The value of RINs is significant to the price of biomass-based diesel. In 2017, RIN prices as a percentage contribution to the daily average B100 spot price, as reported by the Oil Pricing Information System, or OPIS, fluctuated significantly throughout the year and range from a low of $1.19 per gallon, or 38%, in December to a high of $1.76 per gallon, or 56%, in August. 
5

Biodiesel Tax Credit
The federal biodiesel mixture excise tax credit, or BTC, when in effect, provides a $1.00 per gallon excise tax credit to the first blender of biomass-based diesel with at least 0.1% petroleum-based diesel fuel. The BTC can then be credited against such biodiesel federal excise tax liability or the blender can obtain a cash refund from the United States Treasury for the value of the credit. The BTC was first implemented on January 1, 2005, although on several occasions it has been allowed to lapse and then subsequently reinstated, in some cases on a retroactive basis, as detailed in the following table:
.
The BTC is best thought of as an incentive shared across the entire value chain through routine, daily trading and negotiation. In February 2018, the BTC was retroactively reinstated for 2017, but was not reinstated for 2018. It is uncertain whether the BTC will be reinstated for 2018 or any later years.  
California Low Carbon Fuel Standard Credits
The California Low Carbon Fuel Standard, or LCFS, regulation is a rule designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation fuels used in California. The regulation quantifies lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by assigning a “carbon intensity” ("CI") score to each transportation fuel based on that fuel’s lifecycle assessment. Each fuel provider (generally the fuel’s producer or importer, or “regulated party”) is required to ensure that the overall CI score for its fuel pool meets the annual carbon intensity target for a given year. A regulated party’s fuel pool can include gasoline, diesel, and their blendstocks and substitutes. In other words, excess CI reductions from one type of fuel (e.g. diesel) can be used to offset insufficient reductions in another fuel (e.g. gasoline).
We obtain CI credits when we sell qualified biomass-based diesel into California. During 2017, CI credits ranged from $69.5 per metric ton to $113.0 per metric ton, as reported by OPIS. 
Other Government Programs
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 40 states have implemented various programs that encourage the use of biomass-based diesel through blending requirements as well as various tax incentives. The chart below illustrates some of these programs.
6


Government | Program description 
Illinois | Illinois offers an exemption from the generally applicable 6.25% sales tax on fuel for biomass-based diesel blends that incentivizes blending at 11% biomass-based diesel, or B11, through December 31, 2023. Illinois’ program has made that state one of the largest biomass-based diesel markets in the country 
Iowa | Iowa has had in place a retailer’s incentive for blended fuel which has been modified over time. For 2018 through 2024, retailers earn $0.035 per gallon of B5 - B10 and $0.055 per gallons for B11 and above. Iowa also has a biomass-based diesel production incentive that provides $0.02 per gallon of production capped after the first 25 million gallons per production plant. Iowa recently enacted an increase in its excise tax on fuel, which is three cents per gallon less for B11 or higher blends than the diesel fuel tax. 
Texas | The biomass-based diesel portion of biomass-based diesel blends are exempt from state excise tax, which results in a $0.20 per gallon incentive for B100. 
Minnesota | Minnesota law requires a B5 biodiesel blend throughout the entire year. In 2014, the law required the state to increase blends to a B10 blend in the summer months; current law requires the state to move to B20 for the summer months beginning May 2018. 
Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington | These states have all adopted legislation requiring biomass-based diesel blends beginning at B2 with incremental increases, provided certain feedstock or production minimums are met. In addition, Washington State has been in the process of developing legislation on a low carbon fuel programs. 
City of New York | In October 2016, the City of New York adopted legislation requiring biomass-based diesel blends at a 5% rate for heating oil starting on October 1, 2017 and the blend level then moves to 10% in 2025, 15% in 2030 and 20% in 2034. Several northeast states, including Connecticut and Vermont, have adopted legislation requiring biomass-based diesel blends in home heating oil. 
Canada | While a number of provinces in Canada have biofuel programs (British Columbia has an LCFS, Alberta has a usage requirement, Ontario has a usage requirement), the federal government is currently engaged in the rulemaking process on a nationwide Clean Fuel Standard, which may incorporate a number of carbon reducing policies. 

Although we believe that other government requirements for the use of biofuels increase demand for our biomass-based diesel within such regions, they may not increase overall demand in excess of RFS2 requirements. Rather, existing demand for our biofuel from Obligated Parties in connection with federal requirements may shift to regions that have use requirements or tax incentive programs.
RED Program
The Renewable Energy Directive ("RED") establishes a 20% target by 2020 for the use of renewable energy in the transport sector in European Union ("EU") member states. Given the existing limited market presence of alternative fuels or electromobility, the majority of the target is currently being achieved through biofuels. 
EU member states produce yearly renewable energy action plans indicating their yearly national obligations for the use of renewable energy in the transport sector. These national obligations progressively increase every year until achieving the 10% target in 2020.
Biofuels produced from certain types of feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, benefit from an extra incentive as these feedstocks count double towards the 20% target and towards the national obligations.
Risk Management
The prices for feedstocks and biomass-based diesel can be volatile and are not always closely correlated. Lower-cost feedstocks are particularly difficult to risk manage given that such feedstocks are not traded in any public futures market. To manage feedstock and biomass-based diesel price risks, we utilize forward contracting, hedging and other risk management strategies, including the use of futures, swaps, options and over-the-counter products.
In establishing our risk management strategies, we draw from our own in-house risk management expertise and consult with industry experts. We utilize research conducted by outside firms to provide additional market information and risk management strategies. We believe combining these sources of knowledge, experience and expertise expands our view of the fluctuating commodity markets for raw materials and energy to improve our risk management strategies.

Seasonality
Biodiesel producers have experienced seasonal fluctuations in demand for biodiesel. Biodiesel demand has tended to be lower during winter in most states due to blending concentrations being reduced. To mitigate some of these seasonal fluctuations in demand, we have upgraded our Newton and Danville biorefineries to produce distilled biodiesel from lower cost feedstocks, thus allowing that product to have improved cold-weather performance.
Renewable Identification Number, or RIN, prices may also be subject to seasonal fluctuations. The RIN is dated for the calendar year in which it is generated. Since 20% of an Obligated Party's annual Renewable Volume Obligation, or RVO, can be satisfied by prior year RINs, most RINs must come from biofuel produced or imported during the RVO year. As a result, RIN prices can be expected to increase as the calendar year progresses if the RIN market is undersupplied compared to that year's RVO and decrease if it is oversupplied.
Competition
We face competition from producers and suppliers of petroleum-based diesel fuel, other biomass-based diesel producers, marketers, traders and distributors. The size of the biomass-based diesel industry is small compared to the size of the petroleum-based diesel fuel industry and large petroleum companies have greater resources than we do. Our principal competitive differentiators are biomass-based diesel quality and RIN quality, supply reliability and price. We also face competition in the biomass-based diesel RIN compliance market from producers of renewable diesel and in the advanced biofuel RIN compliance market from producers of other advanced biofuels. In the United States and Canadian biomass-based diesel markets, we compete with large, multi-product companies that have greater resources than we do. Archer Daniels Midland Company, Cargill Incorporated, Louis Dreyfus Commodities Group and Ag Processing Inc. are major international agribusiness corporations and biodiesel producers with the financial sourcing and marketing resources to be formidable competitors in the biodiesel industry. These agribusiness competitors tend to make biodiesel from higher cost virgin vegetable oils such as soybean or canola oil, which they produce as part of their integrated agribusinesses. We are also in competition with producers of renewable diesel. For example, Neste Oil has greater resources than we do along with approximately 882 million gallons of renewable diesel production capacity in Asia and Europe. Another renewable diesel competitor is Diamond Green Diesel, LLC, the joint venture between Valero Energy Corp. and Darling International, which has approximately 160 million gallons of production capacity and announced plans to grow its capacity to 275 million gallons and beyond. Renewable diesel can also satisfy the RFS2 biomass-based diesel requirement if the renewable diesel meets the greenhouse gas reduction requirements and may satisfy Canadian renewable fuel requirements. Several refiners appear to be pursuing plans to co-process renewable feedstocks with petroleum crude oil at their refineries, which would add to the competitive marketplace.
In the RFS2 advanced biofuel market, we also compete with other producers and importers of advanced biofuels, such as Brazilian sugarcane ethanol producers and producers of biogas used in transportation. On a global level, we face increasing competition from imported biomass-based diesel and expect this to continue. In January 2015, the EPA announced the approval of a plan submitted by CARBIO, a consortium of Argentinean renewable fuel producers, which allows for Argentinian biodiesel made from soybean oil to generate RINs. Imported biomass-based diesel that does not qualify under RFS2, also competes in jurisdictions where there are biomass-based diesel blending requirements.
We also face competition from independent biodiesel producers, some of which are able to process lower-cost feedstocks. Most of these competitors own only one biodiesel plant and thus, do not enjoy the benefits of scale that we do. Many of these competitors own biodiesel plants that can process only higher cost virgin vegetable oils. Furthermore, in our marketing and distribution, we face competition from biomass-based diesel traders such as US Oil, NGL, Noble, Shell, Tenaska, Vitol and others. These trading companies may have greater financial resources than we do and are able to take significant biomass-based diesel positions in the marketplace. These competitors are often customers and/or suppliers of ours as well.
Segment and Geographic Information
We re-assess our reportable segments on an annual basis. Prior to 2015, our business was organized into two reportable segments - the Biomass-based Diesel segment and the Services segment. As a result of the increased activities surrounding our renewable chemicals business, in 2015 we began reporting a new segment, Renewable Chemicals, which was previously included in the Biomass-based Diesel segment. The Biomass-base Diesel segment includes our operations both in the U.S. and internationally. Financial and geographic information regarding our segments can be found in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
History
Our predecessor, REG Biofuels, LLC, formerly named REG Biofuels Inc., which was formerly named Renewable Energy Group, Inc., was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware in August 2006 upon acquiring the assets and operations of the biodiesel division of West Central Cooperative, or West Central, and two of West Central’s affiliated companies, InterWest, L.C. 
8

and REG, LLC. West Central is now known as Landus Cooperative. Set forth below is a summary of the significant events of our company since June 2008.

Subsequently on June 6, 2014, we acquired the remaining 50% ownership interest in Dynamic Fuels from Tyson Foods. 
December 2014 | Europe investment | We acquired 69% equity ownership in Petrotec AG from its majority shareholder. As of December 31, 2016, we owned approximately 91% of Petrotec's shares. On January 2, 2017, we completed the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in Petrotec and own 100% of the equity in Petrotec. 
August 2015 | Grays Harbor facility | We acquired substantially all of the assets of Imperium Renewables, Inc., or Imperium, including a 100 mmgy nameplate biorefinery and terminal at the Port of Grays Harbor, Washington. 
March 2016 | Madison facility | We acquired a 20 mmgy nameplate capacity biomass-based refinery in DeForest, Wisconsin from Sanimax Energy. 

Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 727 full-time employees in the U.S. and 126 international employees. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Intellectual Property
We own a significant number of U.S. and international patents and expect to file additional patent applications as we continue to pursue technological innovations. We have also developed trade secrets, and have licensed intellectual property related to our biomass-based diesel and industrial biotechnology businesses. We have developed a patented technology that uses microbes to convert sugars to biodiesel in an one-step fermentation process similar to ethanol manufacturing. Some of the patents issued to us do not expire until 2034 and additional patent applications in prosecution if issued will extend beyond 2034.

Customer concentration
Our sales to one customer, Pilot Travel Centers LLC, or Pilot, were $182.2 million, $144.8 million and $114.0 million, representing approximately 8% of our total revenues for each of 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our revenues from Pilot generally do not directly include the RINs associated with the gallons of biomass-based diesel sold. The value of those RINs represented approximately an additional 9%, 9% and 13% of our total sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, based on the OPIS average RIN price for the year.
Research and development
We devote considerable resources to our research and development programs. Our biomass-based diesel research and development programs have been primarily targeted towards improving the quality and efficiency of the biomass-based diesel production process and developing applications for co-products. Our development-stage industrial biotechnology business conducts research and development involving the production of renewable chemicals, additional advanced biofuels and other products from our proprietary microbial fermentation process. Fatty acids are one of three product areas REG Life Sciences has focused on, along with esters and alcohols. In January 2016, ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company and REG Life Sciences commenced a joint development collaboration to develop technology to produce biodiesel by fermenting renewable cellulosic sugars from sources such as agricultural waste. In October 2016, the Company delivered its first commercial product, a specialty fatty acid. REG developed, produced and delivered approximately one metric ton of the renewable, multi-functional chemical to Aroma Chemical Services International, a leading specialty manufacturer and supplier of flavor and fragrance ingredients. In September 2017, we signed a phase II joint development collaboration with ExxonMobil Research and Engineering to continue to develop technology to produce biodiesel by fermenting renewable cellulosic sugars from sources such as agricultural waste.
We expect our research and development expense to decrease in future periods as the business unit generates collaboration revenue. In November 2016, we commenced a strategic review of the life sciences business. We incurred research and development expense of $14.1 million, $18.2 million, and $16.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
