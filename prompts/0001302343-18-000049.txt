Item 1. Business.
Our Company
Education Realty Trust, Inc. ("EdR") is a self-managed and self-advised company incorporated in the state of Maryland in July 2004 to develop, acquire, own and manage collegiate housing communities located near university campuses. We were formed to continue and expand upon the collegiate housing business of Allen & O’Hara, Inc., a company with over 40 years of experience as an owner, manager and developer of collegiate housing. We selectively develop collegiate housing communities for our own account and also provide third-party management services as well as third-party development consulting services on collegiate housing development projects for universities and other third parties. As of December 31, 2017, we owned 70 collegiate housing communities located in 24 states containing 36,420 beds in 13,701 apartment units on or near 41 university campuses. As of December 31, 2017, we provided third-party management services for 16 collegiate housing communities located in 10 states containing 9,832 beds in 3,465 apartment units on or near 15 university campuses.
EdR has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes. All of our assets are held by, and we conduct substantially all of our activities through, Education Realty Operating Partnership, LP ("EROP" and collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries, the "Operating Partnership") and its consolidated subsidiaries, EDR Management Inc. (our "Management Company") and EDR Development LLC (our "Development Company"). The majority of our operating expenses are borne by the Operating Partnership or our communities, as the case may be.
Education Realty OP GP, Inc. (the "OP GP"), an entity that is wholly-owned by EdR, is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As a result, the Board of Directors of EdR (the "Board") effectively directs all of the Operating Partnership’s affairs. EdR indirectly owns approximately 99.9% of the outstanding partnership units (the "OP Units") of EROP and approximately 0.1% of the OP Units are held by the former owners of our initial properties and assets, current and former members of our management team and former members of the Board.

One of our consolidated subsidiaries, University Towers Operating Partnership, LP (the "University Towers Partnership"), holds, owns and operates our University Towers property located in Raleigh, North Carolina. We own 72.7% of the partnership units in the University Towers Partnership, and the remaining 27.3% of the partnership units in the University Towers Partnership are held by the former owners of our initial properties and assets, including a former member of the Board.
2017 Highlights
Financing Transactions
During the first quarter of 2017, we sold all remaining shares under our previous $300 million at-the-market equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) and initiated a new $500 million ATM Program. Shares under these programs were sold by our sales agents during 2017 utilizing forward sales agreements, which allows us to match internal funding requirements and delay dilution of earnings per share and core funds from operations per share. During 2017, we settled 2.6 million of shares issued under these programs and received net proceeds of $110.0 million, which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2017, we had sold but not yet settled 4.8 million shares; all of which can be settled at management’s discretion at any time on or before December 31, 2018. In addition, at December 31, 2017 our remaining availability under the ATM Program was $485.0 million. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - ATM Program.”
On August 31, 2017, we issued $150.0 million of unsecured notes in a private placement transaction. The private placement notes were issued in two tranches with $75.0 million bearing interest at 4.22% and due August 31, 2029, and $75.0 million bearing interest at 4.30% and due August 31, 2032. Proceeds from issuance of the private placement notes were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility. Obtaining this financing has allowed us to ladder our debt maturities and minimize exposure to variable rate debt. 
During 2017, we repaid the following secured indebtedness in full:

• | Variable rate mortgage debt secured by the University Towers collegiate housing community with an outstanding principal balance of $33.0 million. The interest rate was 2.9% per annum and the mortgage debt was scheduled to mature on July 1, 2017.

1


• | Variable rate construction debt with an outstanding principal balance of $29.8 million related to the development of the fourth phase of The Oaks on the Square. The effective interest rate at the repayment date was 2.71%.

In February 2018, the Operating Partnership amended its revolving credit facility (the "Revolver") (see Note 22 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Subsequent to this amendment, the Revolver has a maximum availability of $600.0 million and an accordion feature to $1.0 billion, which may be exercised during the term subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The Revolver is scheduled to mature on February 16, 2023. EdR serves as the guarantor for any funds borrowed by the Operating Partnership under the Revolver. The Revolver contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and contains financial covenants similar to those previous to the amendment (see Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). 
Acquisition, Disposition and Development Activities 
During 2017, we completed the following collegiate housing property acquisitions:
Name | Primary University Served | AcquisitionDate | # of Beds | # of Units | | Contract Price (in thousands)
Retreat at Corvallis | Oregon State University, Oregon | January 2017 | 1,016 | | 330 | | $ | 99,450 
319 Bragg | Auburn University, Alabama | February 2017 | 305 | | 86 | | 28,500 | 
Total | | | 1,321 | | 416 | | $ | 127,950

In the second quarter of 2017, we sold The Reserve on Stinson collegiate housing community for $18.2 million. We received net proceeds of $17.7 million after deducting closing costs and recognized a $0.7 million gain on this disposition. 
During February 2018, we sold the following three collegiate housing communities for a gross sales price of $81.4 million:

Name | Primary University Served | Disposition Date | # of Beds | # of Units
Campus Lodge | University of Florida | February 2018 | 1,115 | | 360
Carrollton Crossing | University of West Georgia | February 2018 | 336 | | 84 
River Pointe | University of West Georgia | February 2018 | 504 | | 132

We expect to record a gain on the sale of these communities of $22.2 million in the aggregate. 
We are currently under contract on three additional properties, with the buyer in the due diligence phase. These sales are expected to close in March and April 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. 
In August 2017, we delivered six new communities (3,318 additional beds), on-time and on-budget, for total costs of $280.9 million. These include two communities at the University of Kentucky, one community at Boise State University, one community at Michigan State University, one community at Texas State University and one community at Northern Michigan University. 
We currently have 12 active development projects that we are developing for our ownership, for which the aggregate development costs are $861.0 million. As of December 31, 2017, $372.5 million of the anticipated costs had been incurred and funded. 
Distributions
During 2017, we declared aggregate quarterly distributions of $1.54 per share of EdR's common stock. At the same time, the Operating Partnership paid an equivalent amount per partnership unit to holders of OP Units.
REIT Status and Taxable REIT Subsidiaries
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. With the exception of income from our taxable REIT subsidiaries (a "TRS" or collectively, the "TRSs"), income earned by the REIT is generally not subject to income taxes. In order to qualify as a REIT, a specified percentage of our gross income generally must be derived from real property sources, which would exclude our income from providing development and management services to third parties as well as our income from certain services afforded to our residents. In order to avoid realizing such income in a manner that would adversely affect our 
2

ability to qualify as a REIT, we provide some services through our Management Company and our Development Company, with our Management Company being treated as a TRS. Our Management Company is wholly-owned and controlled by the Operating Partnership, and our Management Company wholly owns our Development Company. Our Development Company is a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes and all assets owned and income earned by our Development Company are deemed to be owned and earned by our Management Company.
Business and Growth Strategy
Our primary business objective is to achieve sustainable long-term growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize long-term stockholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by (i) acquiring collegiate housing communities nationwide that meet our focused investment criteria, (ii) selectively developing properties for our own account, (iii) building our third-party business of management services and development consulting services and (iv) maximizing net operating income from our owned properties through proactive and goal-oriented property management strategies.
Our business has three reportable segments that are identified by their distinct customer base and services provided: collegiate housing leasing, development consulting services and management services. For a discussion of revenues, profit and loss and total assets by segment see “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
Acquisition and Development Strategy
Acquisitions
We seek to acquire high-quality, well-located communities with modern floor plans and amenities. Our ideal acquisition targets generally are located in markets that have stable or increasing collegiate populations and high barriers to entry. We also seek to acquire investments in collegiate housing communities that possess sound market fundamentals but are under-performing and would benefit from re-positioning, renovation and/or improved property management. We consider the following property and market factors to identify potential property acquisitions:

• | university and campus reputation;


• | competitive admissions criteria;


• | limited number of on-campus beds and limited plans for expansion;


• | significant out-of-state enrollment;


• | distance of property from campus;


• | property unit mix;


• | competition;


• | past operating performance;


• | potential for improved management;


• | ownership and capital structure;


• | presence of desired amenities;


• | maintenance and condition of the property;


• | access to a university-sponsored or public transportation line depending on location; and


• | parking availability.

Conversely, subject to appropriate market conditions, we may dispose of certain collegiate housing communities. We continually assess all of our communities, the markets in which they are located and the colleges and universities they serve, to determine if any dispositions are necessary or appropriate.
Developments
We develop collegiate housing communities for our ownership. The On-Campus Equity Plan (the "ONE PlanSM") is our private equity program, which allows universities to use our equity and financial stability to develop and revitalize campus housing while preserving their credit capacity for other campus projects. The ONE PlanSM offers one service provider and one equity source to universities seeking to modernize on-campus housing to meet the needs of today’s students.

University Flats | University of Kentucky | Lexington, Kentucky | Aug '17 | 771 
The Woods - Phase I | Northern Michigan University | Marquette, Michigan | Aug '17 | 417 

We believe the Trust will continue to enter into more partnerships under the ONE PlanSM due to our proven on-campus development and management experience, size, transparency and financial strength. We believe the ONE PlanSM allows us to provide the perfect opportunity to universities to develop new housing and boost enrollment with a plan tailored to specific needs while simultaneously preserving the university’s credit capacity.
In total, we currently have 12 owned developments that we expect to deliver in 2018, 2019 and 2020, including ONE PlanSM developments at Northern Michigan University (Phase III), Lehigh University, Mississippi State University and Cornell University, seven joint venture developments at Oklahoma State University, University of Pittsburgh, University of Minnesota, Arizona State University, Colorado State University, Iowa State University and University of Hawai'i, and one wholly owned property at Florida State University. Phase II of the ONE PlanSM development at Northern Michigan University was delivered in January 2018.
Joint Ventures
We enter into joint venture agreements to develop, own and manage collegiate housing communities. In some cases, we hold a non-majority ownership interest in the properties and earn a fee for the development and management of the properties, but we typically hold a majority ownership interest (70-90%) in the joint ventures and control these joint ventures through our role as managing member or general partner and as the property manager.

In 2012, our first collegiate housing community developed pursuant to a joint venture agreement was delivered. To date, we have delivered ten communities pursuant to joint venture agreements, including SkyVue at Michigan State University and The Local: Downtown property at Texas State University, which were delivered in August 2017. We currently have the following properties scheduled to be delivered in 2018 and 2019 under joint venture agreements:

Name | EdR's Ownership Percentage | Bed Count | Total Estimated Project Development Cost (1) | EdR's Economic Ownership Cost (1) | Development Cost Funded by EdR's Balance Sheet (Excludes Partner Contribution)
University of Pittsburgh | 80% | 723 | $ | 106,100 | | $ | 84,900 | $ | 100,300
University of Minnesota - Hub at Minneapolis | 51% | 707 | 97,900 | | 49,900 | | 83,500 
Arizona State University - Union Tempe | 90% | 839 | 164,900 | | 148,400 | | 159,100
Colorado State University - Union on Plum | 70% | 229 | 28,200 | | 19,700 | | 25,700 
Iowa State University - Union on Lincoln Way | 70% | 542 | 51,900 | | 36,300 | | 47,300 
University of Hawai'i - Hale Mahana | 90% | 589 | 109,600 | | 98,600 | | 106,300
Oklahoma State University - One on 4th | 70% | 475 | 47,200 | | 33,000 | | 43,700 
Total Active Joint Ventures | | 4.104 | $ | 605,800 | | $ | 470,800 | $ | 565,900

(1) Represents estimates that are subject to change as the development process proceeds.
Our standard joint venture terms include a put option for our partner to put their ownership interest to us after a predetermined amount of time. Most of our partners exercise this put option after the development is completed and, as a result, we wholly own the properties.
Our joint venture strategy enables us to source and take advantage of opportunities not otherwise available to us and to accretively diversify our portfolio by expanding into geographic markets where we are not currently present with lower capital requirements than if we acquired the properties after completion. We expect to continue pursuing joint venture arrangements in the future. 
Operating Strategy
We seek to maximize net operating income of the collegiate housing communities that we own and manage through the following operational strategies.
Maximize revenue.  We have developed and implemented proactive marketing practices to enhance the visibility of our collegiate housing communities and to optimize our revenue. We study our competitors, our residents and university policies affecting enrollment and housing. Based on our findings at each property, we formulate a marketing and sales plan for each academic leasing period. This plan is closely monitored and adjusted, if necessary, throughout the leasing period using our PILOT leasing management system, giving us the flexibility in finding the optimal mix of rate and occupancy. We intend to continue to market our properties to students, parents and universities by emphasizing collegiate-oriented living areas, state-of-the-art technology and infrastructure, a wide variety of amenities and services and close proximity to university campuses.
Controlling costs.  We seek to maximize property-level profitability through the use of cost control systems and our focused on-site management personnel. Some of our specific cost control initiatives include:

• | establishing internal controls and procedures for consistent cost control throughout our communities; and


• | negotiating service-level pricing arrangements with national and regional vendors and requiring corporate-level approval of service agreements for each community.

Maintain the physical assets in top condition. We strive to maintain our assets in the best condition through an intense property and asset management focus. We conduct periodic preventive maintenance, quarterly inspection of units, perform annual turn and make ongoing capital investments to protect and grow existing property values. 
Maintain and develop strategic relationships.  We believe that establishing and maintaining relationships with universities, developers, managers, owners and brokers of collegiate housing properties is important to the ongoing success of our business. We believe that these relationships will continue to provide us with referrals that enhance our leasing efforts, opportunities for additional acquisitions of collegiate housing communities and contracts for third-party services.
5

Develop and retain personnel.  We staff each collegiate housing community that we own or manage with an on-site property management team. We have developed programs and procedures to train each team of on-site employees and to provide them with corporate-based support for each essential operating function. To retain employees, we have developed an incentive-based compensation structure that is available to all of our key on-site personnel.
Third-Party Services Strategy
In addition to developing communities for our ownership and managing our owned collegiate housing communities, we seek to provide development consulting and management services for universities and other third-party owners who rely upon the private sector for assistance in developing and managing their collegiate housing properties. We perform third-party services in order to enhance our reputation with universities and to benefit our primary goal of owning high-quality collegiate housing communities. We perform third-party services for collegiate housing communities serving some of the nation’s most prominent systems of higher education, including the University of North Carolina and the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. In order to comply with the rules applicable to our status as a REIT, we provide our third-party services through our Development Company and our Management Company. Unlike the income earned from our properties owned by the Trust, the income earned by our Development Company and our Management Company is subject to regular federal income tax and state and local income taxes where applicable.
Third-party development consulting services
We provide third-party development consulting services primarily to universities seeking to replace older housing or add modern new on-campus collegiate housing to their campus. We typically are notified that we have been awarded development consulting services projects on the basis of a competitive award process and thereafter begin work on the project pursuant to the terms of a pre-development agreement. In the case of tax exempt bond-financed projects, we enter into a pre-closing agreement to define our scope of services and provide for the advancement and repayment of pre-closing expenses. We enter into final development and construction documents at the bond closing. Our development consulting services typically include the following:

• | market analysis and evaluation of housing needs and options;


• | cooperation and collaboration with university in architectural design;


• | assisting the university in determining the best financing solution for their unique needs;


• | negotiation of ground lease, development agreement, construction contract, architectural contract and bond documents;


• | oversight of architectural design process;


• | coordination of governmental and university plan approvals;


• | oversight of construction process;


• | design, purchase and installation of furniture, fixtures and equipment;


• | assistance in pre-opening marketing to potential residents; and


• | obtaining final approvals of construction.

By providing these services, we are able to observe emerging trends in collegiate housing development and market acceptance of unit and community amenities and build relationships with universities. Our development consulting services also provide us with opportunities to obtain additional third-party property management contracts. In 2017, our fees from third-party development consulting services represented 1.6% of our revenues, excluding operating expense reimbursements.
Since 2000, we have provided third-party development consulting services to clients for projects totaling approximately $1.6 billion in value. We currently are not under any contracts to provide third-party development services, but are in the process of finalizing terms for two recently awarded deals.

Third-party management services
We provide third-party management services for collegiate housing communities owned by educational institutions, charitable foundations and others. Our management services can cover all aspects of operations, including residence life and student development, marketing, leasing administration, strategic relationships, information systems, food service management and oversight and accounting services. These services are comparable to the services that we provide for our owned portfolio. We typically provide these services pursuant to multi-year management agreements. These agreements usually have an initial term of two to five years with renewal options of similar terms. We believe that providing these services allows us to leverage our existing management expertise and infrastructure. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our fees from third-party management services represented 1.2% of our revenue, excluding operating expense reimbursements. As of December 31, 2017, we provided third-party management services for 16 collegiate housing communities containing 9,832 beds in 3,465 units on or near 15 university campuses located in 10 states.
Our Operations
We staff each of our off-campus owned and managed collegiate housing communities with a full-service property management team. We typically staff each property with one community manager, a marketing/leasing manager, a resident services manager, a maintenance supervisor and general office and maintenance staff. Each property management team markets, leases and manages the community with a focus on maximizing its profitability. In addition, each property management team is trained to provide social and developmental opportunities for residents through our "Live here. Live well." program, enhancing the residents’ college experiences as well as the desirability of our communities.
We staff each of our on-campus owned and managed collegiate housing communities with a property management team to meet the duties and responsibilities as outlined in the ground lease and/or operating agreement. These services range from facilities maintenance to campus wide assignments. 
We have developed policies and procedures to carefully select and develop each team of on-site employees and to provide each team with corporate-based support for each essential operating area, including lease administration, sales/marketing, community and university relations, student life administration, maintenance, loss prevention, accounting, human resources/benefits administration and information systems. The corporate level personnel responsible for each of these areas support each community manager’s leadership role and are available as a resource to the community managers around the clock.
Residence Life and Student Development
Two of our Vice Presidents of Operations oversee Residence Life, and are responsible for the designs and direction of our residence life program. Our programs are developed at the corporate level and implemented at each community with our on-site personnel. We provide educational, social and recreational activities designed to help students achieve academic goals, promote respect and harmony throughout the community and help bridge interaction with the respective university. Examples of our residence life and student development programs include:

• | community-building and social activities geared to university-related events, holidays, public safety and education;


• | study and attention skills counseling;


• | career development, resume writing and employment search skill training;


• | sponsorship of intramural sport teams, academic clubs and alumni-based activities;


• | parent and resident appreciation events;


• | community service activities including recycling, blood drives, food drives and student volunteer committees;


• | lectures focused on social issues, including effective communication, multi-cultural awareness and substance abuse;


• | university outreach activities; and


• | voter registration, enrollment and education.

At the majority of our off-campus owned communities, we employ student workers and community assistants to perform key roles in the administrative functioning of the community and interface with residents through constructive programs, activities and listening to resident interests and concerns. Our on-site leadership selects residents to serve as community assistants who meet criteria established in our residence life program. 
7

Marketing
We begin our annual marketing campaign by thoroughly segmenting the student population attending each of the primary universities where our collegiate housing communities are located, and compiling market surveys of comparable collegiate apartment properties. With this information, we formulate a marketing/sales strategy that consists of a renewal campaign for current residents and a broader campaign directed at the eligible student population. We assess university regulations regarding housing requirements to avoid targeting segments of the market in which students are not eligible to live off-campus.
We typically begin our renewal campaign in October of each year. Signage, social networking, direct mailings to the students and their parents, appreciation parties and staff selling incentives are key elements of the renewal campaign. The community assistant team plays a key role in communicating the renewal message throughout its assigned property area. We use a database of current resident demographic data to direct sales information to primary feeder high schools, particularly where new freshmen are eligible to live off-campus. Other database criteria include gender, high school location, prior apartment community, academic class standing, field of study and activity preferences.
We appeal to the greater university population through theme-based advertising campaigns, open house activities, housing fairs conducted by the university, web-based advertising and social networking media. Our professional leasing and marketing staff targets certain university-sponsored on-campus events. Wherever possible, our collegiate housing communities appear on university websites in listings of off-campus housing options, together with banner advertising where available.
Leasing
The majority of our off-campus owned communities have standard leases that begin in mid-August of each year and run for approximately 11.5 months, ending July 31 or early August of each year to coincide with each university’s fall academic term. In some cases where the university operates on quarters rather than semesters, the leases may begin in September and end in August. In addition, the University Towers serving North Carolina State University and The Berk on College and The Berk on Arch serving the University of California, Berkeley operate under an academic lease term with eight or nine installment payments. 
The majority of our on-campus owned communities operate on an academic lease term, which generally represent eight or nine-month leases. 
Our standard lease is an agreement between the student and the student's parental guarantor, and us. The majority of our lease agreements provide for the lease of a single bed in a private or shared bedroom, with rights to share common areas within the unit and throughout the community. This “individual lease” is a strong selling attraction as it limits a student’s liability to the rental for one bed or bedroom instead of burdening the student with shared liability for the entire unit rental amount.
We lease our units by floor plan type using PILOT, our property leasing/marketing system, to maximize full leasing of entire units and avoid spotty vacancies, particularly in our four-bedroom units. We offer roommate-matching services to facilitate full occupancy. We develop waiting lists and monitor popular floor plans that fill to capacity early in the leasing season. In certain communities where either the university or the market expects student housing to be leased by the unit rather than by the bed, we enter into lease agreements relating to the entire unit to address market expectations.
Unlike conventional apartment communities that have monthly move-outs and renewals, our collegiate housing community occupancies remain relatively stable throughout the academic year, but must be entirely re-leased at the beginning of each academic year. Because of the nature of leasing to students, we are highly dependent upon the success of our marketing and leasing efforts during the annual leasing season, generally October through August. Our leasing staff undergoes intensive annual professional training to maximize the success of our leasing efforts.
We typically require rent to be paid in equal installments throughout the lease term. In our owned off-campus communities, we require the first installment to be paid approximately 30 days prior to move-in. Residence hall and owned on-campus residents typically pay their annual rent by semester in two installments. We replace contracted residents who fail to pay the first installment with people on our waiting list or from walk-in traffic while the market is still active with students seeking housing at the commencement of the academic year.
8

Strategic Relationships
We assign high priority to establishing and nurturing relationships with the administration of each of the primary universities where our collegiate housing communities are located. Our corporate staff establishes this network, and on-site management then sustains and enhances the relationship with follow-up by corporate staff during routine visits to the community. As a result of our strategic relationships, universities often refer their students to our properties, thus enhancing our leasing effort throughout the year. These networks create goodwill for our collegiate housing communities throughout the university administration, including departments of admissions, student affairs, public safety, athletics and international affairs.
Most universities promote off-campus housing alternatives to their student population. It is our intention to be among the most preferred off-campus residences and for universities to include our communities in listings and literature provided to students. We seek to obtain student mailing lists used by universities and to be featured in web-based collegiate housing listings wherever permitted by the institution and incorporate these initiatives into our marketing efforts. Our community managers make scheduled personal visits to academic departments at the universities to further our community exposure at this level.
In addition to our university relationships, our management team has developed long-standing relationships with developers, owners and brokers of collegiate housing properties that allow us to identify and capitalize on acquisition opportunities. As a result, we have generated an internal database of contacts that we use to identify and evaluate acquisition candidates. As it is our intention to develop a diverse portfolio of collegiate housing communities, we also develop strategic relationships with equity investors in order to pursue acquisitions through joint venture arrangements.
Competition
Competition from universities
We typically compete for residents with the owners of on-campus collegiate housing, which is generally owned by educational institutions or charitable foundations. Educational institutions generally do not have to pay real estate taxes and may be able borrow funds at lower interest rates, while we and other private sector operators pay full real estate tax rates and have higher borrowing costs. The competitive advantages of on-campus collegiate housing also include its physical proximity to the university campus and captive student body. Moreover, many universities have policies requiring students to live in their on-campus facilities during their freshman year.
On-campus housing is limited, however, and most universities are able to house only a small percentage of their students. As a result, educational institutions depend upon, and may serve as referral sources for, private providers of off-campus housing. In addition, off-campus housing facilities tend to offer greater amenities and more relaxed rules and regulations than on-campus properties and therefore tend to be more appealing to students. Off-campus collegiate housing offers freedom from restrictions, such as quiet hours or gender visitation limitations, and is especially appealing to upperclassmen who are transitioning toward greater independence.
Competition from private owners
We compete with several regional and national owner-operators of off-campus collegiate housing, including one publicly-traded competitor, American Campus Communities, Inc. (NYSE: ACC). We also compete with privately held developers, other real estate firms and smaller local owner-operators in a number of the markets in which we operate. Currently, the collegiate housing industry is fragmented with no participant holding a dominant market share. We believe that a number of other large national companies with substantial financial resources may be potential entrants into the collegiate housing business. The entry of one or more of these companies could increase competition for residents and for the acquisition, management and development of collegiate housing properties. We believe the main competitive factors in our industry include proximity to campus, amenities, rental rates and service reputation. Our portfolio has strong characteristics such as close proximity to campus (median distance is 0.1 miles), extensive amenities, bed/bath parity, extensive resident’s life programming, on-site professional management and relatively new communities (average age of seven years). Our rental rates align with these characteristics and the market we serve, although our rates may be higher than individual competitor’s. 
9

Environmental Matters
As a current or prior owner, manager and developer of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties. Environmental laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the costs of any required investigation or cleanup of these substances can be substantial. The liability is generally not limited under such laws and could exceed the property’s value and the aggregate assets of the liable party. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties also may expose us to third-party liability for personal injury or property damage, or adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real property or to borrow using the real property as collateral. These and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in “Item 1A. — Risk Factors” below.
