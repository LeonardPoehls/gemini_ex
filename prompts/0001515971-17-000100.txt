ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
BUSINESS

Pacific Gold Corp. (Pacific Gold or the Company) is engaged in the identification, acquisition, and development of mining prospects believed to have known gold, tungsten or uranium/vanadium mineral deposits. The main objective is to identify and develop commercially viable mineral deposits on prospects over which the company has rights that could produce revenues. Development of commercially viable mineral deposits of any metal includes a high degree of risk which careful evaluation, experience and factual knowledge may not eliminate, and therefore, we may never produce any significant revenues.
Projects and Royalties

Black Rock Canyon Mine (formerly Nevada Rae Gold, Inc.)

On July 15, 2015 the Company sold all of its interest in Nevada Rae Gold, Inc. and the Black Rock Canyon Mine for the following consideration: $300,000, which was all used to satisfy some of the immediate accounts payable of Nevada Rae Gold, Inc.; $100,000 that was due to the Company on July 15, 2016, of which $54,777 was used to satisfy remaining payroll liabilities taxes; and a royalty of 4% on all Nevada Rae Gold, Inc. gold sales up to a maximum total royalty payments of $720,000. All of the payments are subject to a 10% finders fee which has not yet been paid.
Project W (formerly Pilot Mountain Resources Inc.)

Pilot Mountain Resources Inc. (PMR) was merged into Pacific Gold Corp. on September 30, 2013.

On February 18, 2014, the Company completed an amendment to its Option and Asset Sale Agreement with Pilot Metals Inc. As amended, instead of $850,000 to be paid on March 31, 2014 and $1,000,000 on the commencement of commercial mining, the Company received $200,000 on February 18, 2014 and received $400,000 on March 31, 2014 with $1,500,000 to be received on the commencement of commercial mining.

The payments made to PMR are subject to a 15% royalty to Platoro West, Inc. All royalty payments have been made.

Graysill Vanadium/Uranium Mining Claims

The Company owns 40 unpatented lode mining claims in San Juan and Dolores Counties, Colorado immediately southeast of Bolam Pass.

Description and Location

The claims are located at an elevation of 11,000 feet above mean sea level and are accessible by a dirt road that is maintained during the summer months by the United States Forest Service. The property, which is referred to as the Graysill Property, encompasses the historic Graysill Mine, a past producer of vanadium and uranium ore. The Graysill Mine is known to have produced vanadium and by-product uranium during a period of approximately twenty years after World War II. Before the mine ceased production, approximately 32,000 tons of ore were mined with a reported grade of 2.41% vanadium pentoxide and 0.09% uranium oxide. In 1989, representatives of the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines Division, examined a number of abandoned mines in the San Juan National Forest, one of which was the Graysill Mine. Subsequently, in 1992, the Bureau of Mines produced a Mineral Land Assessment Open File Report titled "Mineral Appraisal of San Juan National Forest, Colorado". Most of the information relating to the Graysill Mine and the geology and mineralization of the general area within which the Graysill Property is located was obtained from this Open File Report.

The property is underlain by a gently dipping assemblage of Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks within which vanadium and uranium occurs in many of the rock units in a stratabound manner, exhibiting little or no apparent relationship to regional structural trends. Although vanadium and uranium occurrences are ubiquitous and are known to exist in over 20 distinctly different sedimentary units in the vicinity of the property of American Uranium, the Pennsylvanian-Permian Rico Formation and the Upper Jurassic Entrada Sandstone are the only formations which have been mined previously for vanadium and uranium. Most of the past production has come from the Entrada Sandstone. Historically, there have been a number of uraniferous vanadium deposits developed in the Entrada Sandstone along a sinuous trend extending in a north-south direction for over 100 miles. This trend coincides with a major structural feature representing a transitional zone between the Colorado Plateau and the Southern Rocky Mountain physiographic provinces.

History

During the past 50 years, the general region within which the property is located has been subjected to several periods of extensive exploration. The major programs were carried out by Vanadium Corporation of America during the late 1940's and early 1950's, and by Atlas Corporation in the late 1970s. Although the collective efforts of these companies resulted in the discovery and definition of significant, high grade vanadium reserves containing a high incidence of uranium, a major decline in the market for these commodities in the early 1980s eliminated all interest in the area at that time.

Concurrent with the height of exploration, uranium mining in the project area was initiated on a small scale in the 1940s and peaked in the late 1950s. Sporadic production of vanadium and uranium continued into the 1970s. Incomplete production records from the Graysill Mine, the largest producer in the area, indicate that a total of 32,000 tons yielding approximately 52,000 pounds of uranium oxide and in excess of 1.5 million pounds of vanadium pentoxide were produced before the mine ceased operations because of low vanadium and uranium prices.

Regulation

The exploration and development of a mining prospect is subject to regulation by a number of federal and state government authorities. These include the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Bureau of Land Management, as well as the various state environmental protection agencies. The regulations address many environmental issues relating to air, soil and water contamination and apply to many mining related activities including exploration, mine construction, mineral extraction, ore milling, water use, waste disposal and use of toxic substances. In addition, we are subject to regulations relating to labor standards, occupational health and safety, mine safety, general land use, export of minerals and taxation. Many of the regulations require permits or licenses to be obtained and the filing of Notices of Intent and Plans of Operations, the absence of which or inability to obtain will adversely affect the ability for us to conduct our exploration, development and operation activities. The failure to comply with the regulations and terms of permits and licenses may result in fines or other penalties or in revocation of a permit or license or loss of a prospect.

We must comply with the annual staking and patent maintenance requirements of the States of Nevada and Oregon and the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM). We must also comply with the filing requirements of our proposed exploration and development, including Notices of Intent and Plans of Operations. In connection with our exploration and assessment activities, we have pursued necessary permits where exemptions have not been available although, to date, most of these activities have been done under various exemptions. We will need to file for water use and other extractive-related permits in the future.

Competition

We expect to compete with many mining and exploration companies in identifying and acquiring claims with gold mineral deposit. We believe that most of our competitors have greater resources than us. We also expect to compete for qualified geological and environmental experts to assist us in our exploration of mining prospects, as well as any other consultants, employees and equipment that we may require in order to conduct our operations. We cannot give any assurances that we will be able to compete without adequate financial resources.

Employees

Pacific Gold has one employee who is the executive officer. From time to time we hire heavy machinery operators, geological experts, engineers and other operations consultants and independent contractors and laborers, for differing periods to facilitate the implementation of our business plan.
