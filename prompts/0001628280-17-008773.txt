Our Business 
We are a supplier of core optical network technology to leading telecommunications and data communications equipment companies and to datacenter and network operators worldwide. We target communications equipment manufacturers that integrate our optical technology into the switching, routing and transport systems they offer to the global service and content providers that are building, upgrading and operating high-performance optical networks. Service and content providers are increasingly demanding greater levels of network capacity from their communications equipment suppliers, our primary customers, in order to meet their rapidly growing network bandwidth requirements. This capacity need is being driven by bandwidth intensive applications and devices that are at the access or edge of the network, such as all forms of mobile devices, streaming video, social media and cloud computing. 
The optical communications market has started to expand beyond a small number of very large service providers, and is now transitioning to a variety of open and captive networks created solely for in house use by large video services, search engines and companies offering a variety of cloud computing services. We believe that the trend toward an increase in demand for optical solutions, which increase network capacity, is in response to growing bandwidth demand driven by increased transmission of video, voice and data over optical communications networks. Service providers also seek to decrease the total cost of ownership of their networks. Many of our advanced optical solutions are implemented in emerging network architectures, helping to provide a level of flexibility and responsiveness that enables savings in both operational and capital expenses. The rapid development of network infrastructure underway in developing countries is also driving growth in demand for optical solutions. Increasingly, internet content providers with their own wide area networks have similar requirements and are also becoming customers for our optical network products. We design, manufacture and market optical components, modules and subsystems that generate, detect, combine and separate light signals in optical communications networks. During fiscal year 2017, we were a leading supplier of optical products at the component level, including tunable lasers, external modulators, integrated lasers and modulators and receivers. During fiscal year 2017, we were also a leading supplier of products at the module and subsystem levels, including transceivers, transponders and controlled subsystems. Many of our products enable increased flexibility in optical communications networks, making the networks more dynamic in nature. We supply transmission products at the component level and the module level into 10 gigabits per second ("Gb/s"), 100 Gb/s, 200 Gb/s and 400 Gb/s optical coherent communications solutions.
Additionally, in data communications ("datacom"), enterprises and institutions such as data centers have grown in complexity as they manage the rapidly escalating demands for increased bandwidth and diverse types of data driven through the consumerization 
4

of information technology and the transition to Software as a Service ("SaaS") services. These next generation architectures, such as hyperscale data centers, require very high speed interconnects to support intensive data traffic within and between corporate data centers. The providers of hyperscale data centers are upgrading and deploying their own high speed local, storage and wide-area networks, also called LANs, SANs and WANs, respectively. These deployments increase the ability to utilize high-bandwidth applications that are growing in importance to their organizations and also increase utilization across telecommunications networks as this traffic leaves the LANs, SANs and WANs and travels over the network service providers’ edge and core networks. We are a leading supplier of client-side and short reach optical transceivers operating over single-mode fiber at 10 Gb/s, 25 Gb/s and 100-400 Gb/s into datacom and enterprise solutions.
Demand for mobile connectivity is increasing rapidly across a growing range of devices, from phones to tablet computers. Mobile infrastructure providers wishing to enable consumers to use bandwidth intensive applications such as video streaming must implement optical solutions from the mast head to a remote terminal and/or central office. We are a supplier of optical transceivers at speeds up to 100 Gb/s into the wireless fronthaul and backhaul market.
For the years ended July 1, 2017, July 2, 2016 and June 27, 2015, our revenues were $601.0 million, $407.9 million and $341.3 million, respectively. We had net income of $127.9 million and $8.6 million for the years ended July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016, respectively, and incurred a net loss of $56.7 million for the year ended June 27, 2015. As of July 1, 2017, July 2, 2016 and June 27, 2015, our total assets were $665.1 million, $359.0 million and 325.9 million, respectively. 
Competitive Differentiation
We believe that demonstrating the following competitive strengths will continue to be important to maintain and reinforce our position as a leading provider of core optical network components, modules and subsystems:

• | Optical Technology Leadership. We have extensive expertise in optical technologies including optoelectronic semiconductors, electronics design, firmware and software capabilities. Our expertise includes III-V optoelectronic semiconductors utilizing indium phosphide ("InP") and Lithium Niobate substrates. As of July 1, 2017, we have approximately 1,000 issued patents. Our intellectual property ("IP") portfolio represents a significant investment in the optical industry over the past 30 years. We believe our commitment to the optical industry and our IP and know-how represents a differentiated value proposition for our customers. We are a leading supplier in many of our metro and long-haul telecom and 100 Gb/s datacom product markets.

We believe our customer-centric strategy will enable us to continue to gain share in our markets by innovating in partnership with our customers and delivering cost-effective solutions to them.


• | In the Future We May Consider the Use of Strategic Investments, Acquisitions and Divestitures to Maintain an Optical Leadership Position. Our industry has historically been fragmented and characterized by large numbers of competitors, but in recent years has experienced increasing levels of consolidation. In addition to our internal development capabilities, we have used acquisitions as a means to enhance our scale, obtain critical technologies and enter new markets. We have historically expanded our business through acquisitions where we have seen an opportunity to enhance scale, broaden our product offerings or integrate new technology. Our July 2012 acquisition of Opnext, Inc. ("Opnext") was consistent with this strategy. In addition, we have participated in significant merger and acquisition activities in the past, including our merger with Avanex in April 2009. The divestitures of our Oclaro Switzerland GmbH subsidiary and associated laser diodes and pump business (the “Zurich Business”) in September 2013, our optical amplifier and micro-optics business (the "Amplifier Business") in November 2013 and our industrial and consumer business based in Komoro, Japan (the "Komoro Business") in October 2014 were examples of transactions that enabled us to maintain strategic competitive focus. In the future, we may make strategic investments or acquire companies or businesses to extend or reinforce our position. 

Our Product Offerings

• | Client Side Transceivers. Our pluggable transceiver portfolio includes fixed wavelength XFP and SFP+ at 10 Gb/s; CFP at 40 Gb/s; CFP, CFP2, CFP4 and QSFP28 at 100 Gb/s; and CFP8 at 400 Gb/s. These package form factors support different link distances based on different optical connectors and media types, in both industry standard and proprietary optical specifications. These link distances typically go from 2 kilometers to 100 kilometers, depending on the laser and receiver technology utilized.

• | Line Side Transceivers. We believe the photonic integration of our internal components represents a differentiator and a competitive advantage in our 10 Gb/s tunable XFP and tunable SFP+ products. We were the first company to supply coherent CFP2 transceivers at 100 Gb/s and 250 Gb/s. Our internal device and sub-assembly technology enables our customers to provide coherent pluggable 100 Gb/s and 200 Gb/s solutions for metro and long haul networks.


• | Tunable laser transmitters. Our tunable laser products include discrete lasers and co-packaged laser modulators to optimize performance and reduce the size of the product. Our tunable products at the component level include a tunable optical sub assembly and a 10 Gb/s co-packaged tunable laser mach-zender modulator. They also include an integrated tunable laser assembly ("iTLA") and a 100 Gb/s or 200 Gb/s tunable laser assembly plus modulator ("iTXA"). We are in production of our micro-iTLA and iTXA, tunable laser products which are suitable for 100 Gb/s and 200 Gb/s systems.


• | Lithium niobate modulators. Our lithium niobate external modulators are optical devices that manipulate the phase or the amplitude of an optical signal. Their primary function is to transfer information on an optical carrier by modulating the light. These devices externally modulate the lasers of discrete transmitter products including, but not limited to, our own standalone laser products. We are leaders in the market for 100 Gb/s and 200 Gb/s modulators for coherent applications. We also supply a 400 Gb/s modulator for coherent applications.


• | Transponder modules. Our transponder modules provide both transmitter and receiver functions. A transponder includes electrical circuitry to control the laser diode and modulation function of the transmitter as well as the receiver electronics. We supply a small form factor tunable transponder at 10 Gb/s. We believe the photonic integration of our internal componentry can represent a differentiator and a competitive advantage in certain of these products.


• | Discrete lasers and receivers. Our portfolio of discrete receivers for metro and long-haul applications includes 10 Gb/s XMD PIN and avalanche photodiode ("APD") receivers, 10 Gb/s coplanar receivers in PIN and APD configurations and 20 Gb/s balanced receivers. We also supply distributed feedback ("DFB") laser die at 10 Gb/s and 25 Gb/s.

Total revenues | $ | 600,968 | | | $ | 407,914 | | $ | 341,276

Manufacturing
We have wafer fabrication facilities in Caswell, U.K.; Sagamihara, Japan; and San Donato, Italy. We also have facilities in Shenzhen, China and Sagamihara, Japan where we perform assembly and test operations. In our San Donato, Italy facility we also manufacture lithium niobate modulators; and in our Sagamihara facility we also perform assembly and test operations for our 100 Gb/s client side transceivers. We believe that innovation at the wafer and fab level is a key differentiator in optical components and we are positioned accordingly. We also use third-party contract manufacturers in Asia, and continually evaluate the capabilities of additional potential contract manufacturing partners to ensure we have a scalable and cost effective manufacturing strategy appropriate for executing our business objectives over a long-term horizon.
We believe our wafer fabrication facilities position us well to introduce product innovations delivering optical network cost and performance advantages to our customers. We also believe that our ability to deliver innovative technologies in a variety of form factors, ranging from chip level to module level to subsystem level, allows us to address the needs of a broad base of potential customers regardless of their desired level of product integration or complexity.
We believe our advanced chip and component design and manufacturing facilities would be very expensive to replicate. On-chip, or monolithic, integration of functionality is more difficult to achieve without control over the production process, and requires advanced process know-how and equipment. Although the market for optical integrated circuits is still in its early stages, it shares many characteristics with the semiconductor market, including the positive relationship between the number of features integrated on a chip, the wafer size and the cost and sophistication of the fabrication equipment. We believe our wafer fabrication facilities provide a competitive advantage by allowing us to increase the complexity of the optical circuits that we design and manufacture, 
8

and the integration of photonics components within smaller packages, without the relatively high cost, power and size issues associated with less integrated solutions.
Our manufacturing capabilities include fabrication processing operations for InP substrates and lithium niobate substrates, including clean room facilities for each of these fabrication processes, along with assembly and test capability and reliability/quality testing. We utilize semiconductor processing equipment in these operations, such as epitaxy reactors, metal deposition systems, photolithography, etching, analytical measurement and control equipment. Our assembly and test facilities, whether internal or under service agreements with our contract manufacturers, include specialized automated assembly equipment, temperature and humidity control and reliability and testing facilities. 
As of July 1, 2017, our manufacturing organization was comprised of 1,363 people. 
Research and Development
We draw upon our internal development and manufacturing capabilities to continue to create innovative solutions for our customers. We believe that continued focus on the development of our technology, and cost reduction of existing products through design enhancements, are critical to our future competitive success. We seek to expand and develop our products to reduce cost, improve performance and address new market opportunities, and to enhance our manufacturing processes to reduce production costs, provide increased device performance and reduce product time to market.
We have significant expertise in optical technologies such as optoelectronic semiconductors utilizing InP, lithium niobate substrates and micro-optic assembly and packaging technology. In addition to these technologies, we also have electronics design, firmware and software capabilities to produce transceivers and transponders. We will also consider supplementing our in-house technical capabilities with strategic alliances or technology development arrangements with third parties when we deem appropriate. We spent $57.1 million, $46.1 million and $46.4 million on research and development during the years ended July 1, 2017, July 2, 2016 and June 27, 2015, respectively. As of July 1, 2017, our research and development organization was comprised of 282 people.
Our research and development facilities are in China, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. These facilities include computer-aided design stations, modern laboratories and automated test equipment. Our research and development organization has optical and electronic integration expertise that facilitates meeting customer-specific requirements as they arise. 
Intellectual Property
Our competitive position significantly depends upon our research, development, engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, and not just on our patent position. However, obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights, including patents, provides us with a further competitive advantage. In the appropriate circumstances, these rights can help us to obtain entry into new markets by providing consideration for cross-licenses. In other circumstances, they can be used to prevent competitors from copying our products or from using our inventions. Accordingly, our practice is to file patent applications in the United States and certain other countries for inventions that we consider significant. In addition to patents, we also possess other intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, design rights and copyrights.
We have a substantial number of patents in the United States and other countries, and additional applications are pending. These relate to technology that we have obtained from our acquisitions of businesses and companies in addition to our own internally developed technology. As of July 1, 2017, we held approximately 1,000 issued patents worldwide, with additional patent applications pending in various jurisdictions. Although our business is not materially dependent upon any one patent, our rights and the products made and sold under our patents, taken as a whole, are a significant element of our business. We maintain an active program designed to identify technology appropriate for patent protection. 
We require employees and consultants to execute appropriate non-disclosure and proprietary rights agreements. These agreements acknowledge our exclusive ownership of intellectual property developed for us and require that all proprietary information disclosed remain confidential. While such agreements are intended to be binding, we may not be able to enforce these agreements in all jurisdictions. Although we continue to take steps to identify and protect our patentable technology and to obtain and protect proprietary rights to our technology, we cannot be certain the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology, especially in certain countries where the legal protections of intellectual property are still developing. We may take legal action to enforce our patents and trademarks and other intellectual property rights. However, legal action may not always be successful or appropriate, and may be costly. Further, situations may arise in which we may decide to grant intellectual property licenses to third parties, in which case other parties will be able to exploit our technology in the marketplace.
We enter into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in our best interest to do so. For example, see our risk factor “Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could result in expensive litigation or require us to obtain a license to use the technology from third parties, or we may be prohibited from selling certain products in the future” appearing in Item 1A of this Annual Report. These may result in net royalties payable 
9

to us by third parties or by us to third parties. However, royalties received from or paid to third parties to date have not been material to our consolidated results of operations.
In the normal course of business, we periodically receive and make inquiries regarding possible patent infringement. In dealing with such inquiries, it may become necessary or useful for us to obtain or grant licenses or other rights. However, there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are not able to resolve or settle claims, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, and/or successfully prosecute or defend our position, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Competition
The optical communications markets are rapidly evolving. We expect these markets to continue to be highly competitive because of the available capacity and number of competitors. We compete with domestic and international companies, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. As of July 1, 2017, we believe that our principal competitors in the optical subsystems, modules and components industry include Acacia Communications, Inc., Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., Finisar Corporation ("Finisar"), Fujitsu Limited ("Fujitsu"), InnoLight Technology Ltd., Lumentum Holdings Inc., NeoPhotonics Corporation ("NeoPhotonics"), Source Photonics Inc. and Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. The principal competitive factors upon which we compete include breadth of product line, availability, performance, product reliability, innovation and selling price. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering high levels of customer value through collaborative product design, technology innovation, manufacturing capabilities, optical/mechanical performance, intelligent features for configuration, control and monitoring, multi-function integration and overall customization. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete favorably with respect to these factors. We encounter substantial competition in most of our markets, although no one competitor competes with us across all product lines or markets.
Consolidation in the optical systems and components industry has intensified the competitive pressures that we face. For example, ADVA announced the acquisition of MRV Communications, Inc. in 2017, Fujitsu announced the acquisition of a 51 percent stake in FITEC Corp. in 2017, APAT Optoelectronics acquired the access and low speed transceiver business from NeoPhotonics in 2017, Avago acquired Broadcom Corp. in 2016, Nokia acquired Alcatel-Lucent in 2016, Ciena acquired Cyan Inc. in 2015, NeoPhotonics acquired the tunable laser product line of Emcore Corporation in 2015, Finisar acquired u2t Photonics AG in 2014 and Avago acquired CyOptics, Inc. in 2013.
We also face competition from companies that may expand into our industry and introduce additional competitive products. Existing and potential customers are also our potential competitors. These customers may internally develop or acquire additional competitive products or technologies, which may cause them to reduce or cease their purchases from us (for example, Cisco's acquisition of Lightwire, Inc., Ciena's acquisition of TeraXion, and Juniper Networks' acquisition of Aurrion, Inc.).
