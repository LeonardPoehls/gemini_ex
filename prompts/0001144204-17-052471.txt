The AEON Business
 
AEON’s primary business focus is on production of actionable medical information for value-based medicine. This includes the testing of an individual’s urine or saliva for the presence of drugs or chemicals and the patient’s DNA profile.
 
AEON is an innovator in the genomic testing area with a comprehensive menu of genetic tests today (pharmacogenomics and cancer genetic testing) and a pipeline of additional genetic tests in development which it anticipates being able to bring to market over the coming year. AEON is investing to expand its genetic testing capabilities to address the rapidly increasing demand for personalized and value-based medical care that involves using an individual’s genetic profile to help guide decisions regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. AEON strives to offer unique testing specifically designed for its increased focus on personalized medicine, with superior service levels. In this effort, AEON provides advanced testing in DNA pharmacogenomics, cancer genetics and molecular microbiology. Genomic testing is more complex than conventional toxicology testing, requires unique knowledge and significantly more sophisticated equipment resulting in higher pricing and less competition.
 
Toxicology is also a major component of AEON’s product mix and will continue to be an important element of AEON’s business strategy. AEON’s toxicology testing provides information about the medication and other substances in the patient’s system from either urine or oral fluid samples. This information helps guide a clinician’s treatment of a patient. Similarly, this testing ensures the safe use of medical prescriptions and is designed to help doctors provide the highest level of care. AEON offers a comprehensive set of toxicology tests to produce results under quality assurance standards consistent with those required by various regulatory bodies.
 
AEON supports its national client base from its Gainesville, Georgia headquarters. AEON is focused on technology innovation and efficiency, utilizing state of the art testing equipment and its proprietary methodologies to provide some of the fastest and most reliable test results in the nation. AEON focuses on a service model that emphasizes the importance of the test result for both the client and the patient. By focusing on fast, accurate turnaround of test results and the ability to integrate directly with the electronic medical records of clients, AEON believes it is able to provide clients a unique service that larger clinical laboratories cannot match. Because of the emphasis on its service model AEON believes it is ideally positioned to be a preferred lab provider for personalized medicine. Currently the majority of AEON’s testing volume is in toxicology. However, AEON has recently placed focus and emphasis on growing its DNA pharmacogenomics and cancer genetic testing in response to rapidly growing market demand for personalized medical testing.
 
AEON’s main testing services currently include:
 

• | Medical Toxicology. AEON’s toxicology testing utilizes HPLC-Tandem Mass Spectrometry testing and provides information about medications and other substances in the patient’s system from either urine or oral fluid samples with rapid 48 to 72-hour turnaround time. This information helps guide a clinician’s treatment of a patient and helps to ensure the safe use of prescription and other medications in pain management, substance abuse, hospital, and other clinical applications and is also routinely used in employment screening and law enforcement.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Numerous media outlets have reported multiple stories detailing the growing crisis that has resulted from the abuse of prescription and illegal drugs. AEON uses the latest innovations in mass spectrometry technology to identify individual drugs in patient specimens. AEON provides confirmatory testing to identify and quantify the level of these drugs. AEON’s drug testing technology can identify more than 70 different drugs and metabolites in urine and oral fluid samples. This information helps physicians determine whether their patients are compliant with their prescription regimens as well as whether they may be abusing illegal drugs.

• | DNA Pharmacogenomics. DNA pharmacogenomics seeks to apply the field of genomics to improve the efficacy and safety of therapeutics. Pharmacogenomics is genetic-based testing to determine patient therapy. Pharmacogenomics testing provides a “personalized” comprehensive report based on an individual patient’s DNA profile that indicates metabolic rates for defined medications. This information helps guide physician’s medication selections including dosages, leading to targeted and personalized therapy, enabling efficient selection of medications and therapies while reducing side effects and the use of ineffective medication regimens. Such testing may be of substantial value to accountable care organizations and employer-based health plans as it may be able to help identify those individuals whose genetic makeup might impact how they react to certain medications.

• | Cancer Genetic Testing. AEON provides testing for hereditary cancer markers, offering multiple BRCA testing options including comprehensive sequencing and deletion/duplication analyses of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and numerous multigene panels. The BRCA gene test is a saliva-based test that uses DNA analysis to identify harmful mutations in either one of these two highly penetrant genes which increase the chance for cancer of the breast, ovaries and fallopian tubes.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Molecular Microbiology. Molecular microbiology identifies microorganisms including viruses, bacteria and parasites through amplified DNA or RNA detection versus traditional microbiology procedures which use culture to grow potential microorganisms. This technique is rapid and highly sensitive, eliminating the need for culturing. Results can be obtained for a variety of pathogens within hours instead of days, creating a powerful diagnostic tool for physicians. AEON’s women’s health infectious disease panel, for example, tests for more than 30 different organisms from a single swab obtained during a doctor’s visit.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
AEON provides high quality, cost-effective genetic testing for hereditary cancer markers using cutting-edge nucleic acid extraction, next generation sequencing and bioinformatics technologies. Along with pharmacogenomics testing, AEON’s cancer genomic testing has expanded to address the rapidly growing demand. AEON’s next generation sequence testing, branded the Cancer Detect Profile, provides information on a range of hereditary cancers that details the connection between a patient’s unique genetic makeup and their risk of developing certain prevalent cancers.
 
AEON’s diagnostic service provides reports on the patient’s unique genetic makeup, and their associated risks of developing certain types of common cancers, and includes significant data showing patient’s DNA profiles. AEON’s highly qualified scientists, along with certified genetic counselors are available for consultation and interpretation of AEON’s reports. These results help healthcare professionals, patients, and their families make future medical care decisions depending on the genomic mutations and associated cancers risks.
 
AEON’s multiple BRCA testing options include comprehensive sequencing and election/duplication analyses of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and numerous multigene panels. The BRCA gene test is a cheek swab test that uses DNA analysis to identify harmful mutations in either one of these two highly penetrant genes which increase the chance for cancer of the breast, ovaries and fallopian tubes.

Scientific Capabilities
 
AEON believes that its success has been driven by its strong scientific team which has more than 200 years of collective experience. The more than 30 members of AEON’s scientific team are involved in the operations of its laboratory and are continually working on research and development activities to expand the scope of the tests offered. A total of eight members of AEON’S scientific team have advanced degrees including five with Doctoral degrees. AEON’s testing utilizes proprietary sample preparation methods to achieve the highest accuracy available. This methodology was developed with a team of leading scientists over several years, ensuring AEON provides the best information for patient care available.
 
Revenue and Sales and Marketing
 
AEON provides testing services to a broad range of health care providers and other customers. The primary client groups serviced by AEON include:
 

• | Physicians
--+-----------


• | Clinics
--+--------


• | Medical Centers
--+----------------


• | Hospitals
--+----------


• | Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)
--+--------------------------------------


• | Rehabilitation Centers or Intensive Outpatient Care Centers
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Employer Health Programs
--+-------------------------

 
AEON’s services are paid for through a mix of reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance along with a direct pay clientele. Currently, the top 50 payors represent over 83% of AEON’s billings with 39% of these billings representing in-network insurance charges. No single customer (payor) accounts for more than 15% of AEON’s revenue or income.
 
AEON generated revenues of approximately $18,912,000, and $33,953,000 for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Billing for laboratory services is a complicated process involving many payors such as managed care organizations or MCOs, Medicare, Medicaid, physicians and physician groups, hospitals, patients and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. Billing process arrangements with third-party administrators may further complicate the billing process and tests ordered by a physician may be billed to different payors, depending on the medical benefits of a particular patient.

The delivery of, and reimbursement for, healthcare continues to change, impacting all stakeholders, including the clinical laboratory business. Medicare, Medicaid and insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services. Measures to regulate healthcare delivery in general and clinical laboratories in particular have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative requirements. The Company expects that pressure to reduce government reimbursement will continue.
 
The Company monitors the aging of accounts receivable as necessary. Bad debt expense is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses as considered necessary to maintain the allowance for doubtful accounts at an appropriate level, based on the Company’s experience with its accounts receivable. The Company writes off accounts against the allowance for doubtful accounts when accounts receivable are deemed to be uncollectible.
 
AEON is actively working to become an in-network provider under contract with all its private health insurance payors which it believes will result in higher volumes and higher collections. AEON has a dedicated staff that solely focuses on contracting with private health insurance payors and the credentialing required to be an in-network provider.
 
AEON markets its services across a wide spectrum of physician specialties, physician organizations, behavioral and mental health rehabilitation groups, third-party administrators (“TPA’s”), pharmacy benefit manager (“PBM’s”), small—medium—large healthcare systems ACOs, employer health programs and hospitals utilizing multiple channels including direct marketing, independent agents and distributors.
 
AEON’s three principal marketing channels include:
 

• | Direct Marketing – AEON employees call direct on accounts ranging from large, national payors to individual physicians.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Independent Agents – AEON has relationships with independent agents who are directly calling on doctors and selling multiple products and services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Distributors – AEON has also teamed with sellers of other medical-related products who offer AEON’s testing services along with their offerings.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
AEON’s early marketing strategy involved directing salespeople or independent agents into the field calling on individual/independent doctors leveraging independent agents who were already calling on the doctors and selling them a variety of other products and services to produce higher testing volumes. AEON’s marketing approach was based upon an approach which emphasized personally developing the agent network marketing AEON’s service-oriented approach. An early differentiator was (and continues to be) AEON’s willingness to work with the medical provider’s electronic medical records (EMR) systems—this creates “stickier” customers with higher retention and disincentive for the customers to switch testing companies once AEON has interfaced with their EMR system. To date, AEON has provided connectivity with numerous EMR vendors.
 
AEON is currently refining its marketing strategy to place increasing emphasis on reaching out to a new cohort of potential revenue including large national payors and management companies, ACOs, hospital systems, treatment centers, specialized physician practices, employer health programs and developing relationships with other labs. A principal area of focus in this strategy is to develop relationships generating higher test volumes and percentage of collections. AEON has made significant staff additions to its direct marketing team to assist with the targeting of these segments. As AEON focuses on direct calling to larger accounts, it will concurrently look to reduce dependence on independent agents, giving AEON better control and lower cost per test. However, the sheer volume of independent agent-driven testing will keep this channel as a significant revenue contributor for the near term.

Industry Background and Competition
 
The clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive. AEON competes with laboratories owned by hospitals, many larger and smaller independent laboratories, as well as physician office laboratories. The clinical laboratory industry consists primarily of three types of providers: hospital-based laboratories, physician-office laboratories and independent clinical and anatomical pathology laboratories. AEON believes that in 2016, the U.S. clinical laboratory testing industry generated revenues of approximately $70 billion based on industry publications, with the total ex-U.S. market standing at over than $100 billion. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services of the Department of Health and Human Services have estimated that in 2016 there were more than 8,900 hospital-based laboratories, 121,200 physician-office laboratories and 5,900 independent clinical laboratories in the U.S.
 
Based on industry data, management believes that the clinical laboratory testing market sector is forecast to grow at an annualized rate of over 5% from its current level. However, this total represents less than 3% of the total U.S. annual healthcare expenditures, estimated to be over $3 trillion, despite the fact that the results of clinical laboratory tests drive 70% of all treatment decisions. Demand for lab services is expected to continue to grow due to a number of factors including the movement towards preventative care, the aging population, higher illicit drug use and the increasing trend towards personalized and value-based medicine. Management believes that large healthcare organizations including payors, providers and administrative service providers will drive increasing testing volumes as they strive to guide the treatment of patients, ensure safe use of prescriptions and help doctors provide the highest level of care.
 
AEON believes that the key differentiating factors giving it advantages over its competitors include:
 

• | Solutions - AEON provides a full suite of medical testing solutions with rapid reporting.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Processes - AEON complements its skilled medical and analytical staff with the use of robotic testing systems for precision and speed; each step is automated to avoid human error. This approach enables AEON to provide the fastest, most-reliable turn-around times in the industry for each professional test.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reviews - AEON reviews every test result multiple times for complete confidence; testing outcomes are reviewed by two different professionals (degree in biology, chemistry or related sciences), then the final report undergoes a review by a senior scientist before being released. This human touch provides oversight that cannot be achieved by fully-automated reporting processes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reports - Testing reports are comprehensive and easy-to-understand; in each testing protocol the outcomes are produced in formats that a physician can quickly grasp; delivered via secured portal, fax or EMR.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Assistance - AEON provides professional assistance in the interpretation of results; trained scientists and/or genetic counselors are on-hand to help the physician understand the results and integrate them into a patient’s overall treatment plan.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Retention - AEON has performed validation studies to allow it to internally retain tested specimens for four months to be available to allow for re-testing if required. This retention policy helps to provide an additional level of confidence to referring physicians.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compliance - AEON employs full-time staff focused on compliance and regulation, and believes it is in compliance with all requirements, and all employees adhere strictly to AEON’s compliance program. Through training, education and AEON’s Medical Testing Marketing Platform (MTMP), employees are held to the highest regulatory and ethical standards while retaining a focus on customer satisfaction.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diagnostic and medical laboratories are an integral part of patients’ medical evaluation and treatment providing healthcare practitioners with information concerning the onset, severity and cause of patients’ ailments and illnesses. The toxicology laboratories industry is in the growth stage of its life cycle, which is characterized by stronger growth than that of the overall economy, due to rapidly changing technologies and increasing market acceptance of the industry’s services. Demand for industry services is expected to grow due to a number of factors including the movement towards preventative care, the aging population, higher illicit drug use and the increasing trend towards personalized and value-based medicine.
 
Toxicology laboratories test an individual’s blood, urine or saliva for the presence of drugs or chemicals. Customers include hospitals, physicians and other health care providers, commercial clients and law enforcement who use the test results to assist in the detection of medication and other substances in the patient’s system. Healthcare provider’s use this information to guide the treatment of patients, ensure safe use of prescriptions and help doctors provide the highest level of care. Employers use the information to screen potential employees or for on-going testing for the use of illicit drugs. Typically, industry operators examine immunoassay, gas chromatography or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) to detect for broad-based drug groups, such as opiates, benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
 
Higher illicit drug use is the primary driver of employers’ demand for toxicology tests. According to the latest data available from the Society for Human Resource Management, in 2011, 57% of businesses in the United States required employees to take drug tests. Per the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 24.6 million Americans aged 12 and older used illicit drugs in the past month, or 9.4% of total adults aged 12 and older, up from 8.9% in 2010.
 
The high incidence of illicit drug and substance abuse in the United States has driven the demand for toxicology tests for employers and law enforcement, among others. Technological advances in toxicology testing have become increasingly available, accurate and cost-effective, enabling industry operators to test for more substances with higher accuracy. As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Affordable Care Act” or “ACA”), the number of people with health insurance is increasing, encouraging visits to the physician and bolstering demand for toxicology labs to test for abnormalities or substances in blood and urine tests.
 
Pharmacogenomics seeks to apply the field of genomics to improve the efficacy and safety of therapeutics. Simply put, pharmacogenomics is genetic-based testing to determine patient therapy. Pharmacogenomics testing services give doctors and healthcare provider’s insight into the genetic makeup of each of their patients and how their bodies metabolize and respond to different medications. The information in comprehensive pharmacogenomics testing reports give doctors the ability to prescribe medications and treatments based upon the individual’s genetic makeup.
 
Due to genetic variations, many patients experience adverse drug reactions (“ADRs”) from drugs that are relatively safe for others. ADRs are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity, which contribute to increased economic cost as well as human cost. In the JAMA study, “Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions in Hospitalized Patients, of the incidence of ADRs,” the authors estimated that in 1994, 2,216,000 hospitalized patients had serious ADRs and 106,000 patients had fatal ADRs. Based on those estimates, ADRs are between the fourth and sixth most common causes of death in the United States. ADRs are estimated to result in $1.56 billion to $4.0 billion dollars in direct hospital costs each year.
 
AEON competes in a market that is highly fragmented and features many small toxicology laboratories that primarily cater to regional demand, such as the local law enforcement sector. However, large-scale companies have entered the market and have provided toxicology testing services to select markets (e.g. employers that have a multitude of establishments) throughout the United States. Over the past five years, market share concentration has increased as a result of stronger merger and acquisition activity. Key industry competitors include Ameritox, Aegis, Dominion, Laboratory Corporation of America and Quest Diagnostics. AEON believes that ongoing consolidation in the clinical laboratory testing business will continue. In addition, AEON believes that it and the other large independent clinical laboratory testing companies will be able to increase their share of the overall clinical laboratory testing market due to a number of factors, including cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing, reimbursement reductions and managed health care entities that require cost efficient testing services and large service networks. In addition, legal restrictions on physician referrals and their ownership of laboratories, as well as increased regulation of laboratories, are expected to contribute to the continuing consolidation of the industry.

AHC has also retained professional consultants to support its marketing and sales efforts by providing it with expertise in specific markets. The markets for healthcare devices and solutions include integrated delivery networks, physician groups and networks, managed and accountable care organizations, hospitals, medical centers, home health agencies, pharmacies, governments and public health organizations. AHC has historically contracted with third parties for the provision of hosting services to support its web-based services. AHC believes that there are sufficient alternative suppliers of these services. AHC augments its own staff from time-to-time by using third party consultants and its software and services incorporate products and services which it licenses from unaffiliated third parties. AHC has utilized the services of a contract manufacturer to assemble telehealth devices and several suppliers for its tablets, peripherals and various component parts and services. AHC believes that adequate alternative suppliers of these products and services exist on commercially reasonable terms so as to mitigate any adverse impacts caused by the termination of any of its existing relationships.
Competition
 
The Company competes in markets for its web-based services and its telehealth products and services that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for the telehealth and web-based services and solutions include features such as ease of use, quality/reliability of our offerings, scalability, features and functionality, customer service and support and price. Competitors to AHC services and solutions offer products, web-based processing of medical forms, signature solutions and patient monitoring products and services that compete with those we have offered. Almost all of these competitors are substantially larger or have more experience and market share than we do in their respective markets. In addition, companies with which we do not presently directly compete may become competitors in the future through their product development in the area of secure online services and telehealth services and such companies may have greater financial, technological, and marketing resources than we do. Therefore, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards and customer requirements. Many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors, and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business.

Quality Assurance
 
AEON maintains a well-structured and vigorous quality assurance program in order to provide accurate and precise clinical information to physicians. AEON holds the required federal and state licenses necessary for the operation of a clinical laboratory at its facilities and must submit to vigorous proficiency tests (or surveys) for all tests that the Company performs. AEON is also subject to unannounced inspections from the various state and federal licensing agencies.
 
The Company has a Quality Assurance Committee, headed by a Quality Assurance Coordinator and composed of supervisors from all of AHC departments. The Committee meets monthly to assess and evaluate laboratory quality. Based on the information received from the Committee, recommendations are made to correct conditions that have led to errors. Management, department supervisors and members of the Committee continually monitor laboratory quality. Depending on the test, two or three levels of quality control materials are run in each analytical assay to enhance precision and accuracy. Patient population statistics are evaluated each day. Testing of highly abnormal samples is repeated to maximize accuracy. The Company participates in numerous externally-administered quality surveillance programs, including the College of American Pathology (CAP) program.
 
The Company believes that all of these procedures are necessary, not only in maintaining federal and state licensing, but also in assuring a quality product. The Company believes that high standards of quality are an important factor in differentiating AEON from the competition.
 
Regulation; Medicare and Private Reimbursement Policies
 
The Company’s business is impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (at both, the federal and state levels), and the other jurisdictions in which it conducts business. These laws and regulations include regulations particular to both segments of the Company’s business, and laws and regulations relating to conducting business. The Company is also subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies.
Privacy and Security Regulations
 
The Company is required to comply with laws and regulations in the United States (at the federal and state levels), and jurisdictions outside the United States in which it conducts business, including the European Union, regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information. These privacy and security laws include the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (collectively, “HIPAA”). The HIPAA security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding protected health information. The HIPAA privacy regulations establish comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information. It also sets forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her protected health information (“PHI”) maintained by a covered entity, such as the right to access or amend certain records or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI. The privacy regulations require covered entities to contractually bind third parties, known as business associates, in the event that they perform an activity or service for or on behalf of the covered entity that involves access to PHI. HIPAA regulations encompass the manner in which certain healthcare information, including claims and remittance advice, is transmitted through the Transactions and Code Sets Rule. The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the current Transactions and Code Sets Rule. However, the failure of the Company, third-party payors or physicians to apply the new code set could have had an adverse impact on reimbursement, days sales outstanding and cash collections. The U.S. Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), which was enacted in February 2009, strengthens and expands the HIPAA privacy and security rules and their restrictions on use and disclosure of PHI. HITECH includes, but is not limited to, prohibitions on exchanging PHI for remuneration and additional restrictions on the use of PHI for marketing. HITECH also changed a business associate’s obligations by imposing a number of privacy and security requirements directly on business associates that were previously only directly applicable to covered entities. Moreover, HITECH requires covered entities to provide notice to individuals, HHS, and, as applicable, the media when unsecured PHI is breached, as that term is defined by HITECH. Business associates are similarly required to notify covered entities of a breach.

As well as the HIPAA regulations described above, there are a number of other national, state and foreign laws regarding the confidentiality and security of medical information, some of which apply to clinical laboratories. These laws vary widely but they most commonly regulate or restrict the collection, use and disclosure of medical and financial information and other personal information. In some cases, state laws are more restrictive and are not preempted by HIPAA. Penalties for violation of these laws may include sanctions against a laboratory’s licensure, as well as civil and/or criminal penalties. Violations of the HIPAA provisions could result in civil and/or criminal penalties, including significant fines and up to 10 years in prison. HITECH also significantly strengthened HIPAA enforcement by increasing the civil penalty amounts that may be imposed, requiring HHS to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance and authorizing state attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations that affect the privacy of state residents. Together, these laws and regulations establish a complex regulatory framework, and may require a healthcare provider to notify individuals or the government if the provider discovers certain breaches of personal information or protected health information. The Company maintains policies and practices in place, designed to meet all applicable requirements.
 
Laws Governing Laboratory Testing Businesses
 
All U.S. laboratories that perform drug testing for certain public sector employees and employees of certain federally regulated businesses are required to be certified as meeting the detailed performance and quality standards of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. In order to obtain access to controlled substances used to perform drugs-of-abuse testing in the United States, laboratories must be licensed by the Drug Enforcement Administration. All of AEON’s laboratories, which perform the type of testing described in this paragraph are certified and licensed as required.
 
The Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services regulate all laboratory testing performed on humans through the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendment of 1988 (“CLIA”). CLIA extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. CLIA requires that all clinical laboratories meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards. Laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections.
 
Standards for testing under CLIA is based on the complexity of the tests performed by the laboratory, with tests classified as “high complexity,” “moderate complexity,” or “waived.” Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than moderate complexity laboratories. Laboratories performing only waived tests, which are tests determined by the Food and Drug Administration to have a low potential for error and requiring little oversight, may apply for a certificate of waiver exempting them from most of the requirements of CLIA. The sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA requirements include suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business; cancellation or suspension of the laboratory’s approval to receive Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification, imposition of a fine or other penalties, or future changes in the CLIA law or regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could have a material adverse effect on AEON.
 
AEON is also subject to state and local laboratory regulation. CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations different from, or more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own laboratory regulatory requirements. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls, or require maintenance of certain records.

Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
Existing federal laws governing federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as similar state laws, impose a variety of broadly described fraud and abuse prohibitions on health care providers, including clinical laboratories. These laws are interpreted liberally, and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, HHS’ Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), and various state agencies. Historically, the clinical laboratory industry has been the focus of major governmental enforcement initiatives. The federal government’s enforcement efforts have been increasing over the past decade, in part as a result of the enactment of HIPAA, which included several provisions related to fraud and abuse enforcement, including the establishment of a program to coordinate and fund federal, state and local law enforcement efforts. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 also included new requirements directed at Medicaid fraud, including increased spending on enforcement and financial incentives for states to adopt false claims act provisions similar to the federal False Claims Act. Recent amendments to the False Claims Act, as well as other enhancements to the federal fraud and abuse laws enacted as part of the ACA, are widely expected to further increase fraud and abuse enforcement efforts. For example, the ACA established an obligation to report and refund overpayments from Medicare within 60 days of identification; failure to comply with this new requirement can give rise to additional liability under the False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties statute. On February 16, 2012, CMS issued a proposed rule to establish regulations addressing the reporting and returning of overpayments. Although the rule has not been finalized, cases have started to emerge with potential False Claims Act liability for retaining an overpayment beyond the 60-day deadline and the necessity to act quickly once an overpayment has been identified.
 
The federal health care programs’ anti-kickback law (the “Anti-Kickback Law”) prohibits knowingly providing anything of value in return for, or to induce, the referral of Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care program business. Violations can result in imprisonment, fines, penalties, and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. The OIG has published “safe harbor” regulations which specify certain arrangements that are protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Law if all conditions of the relevant safe harbor are met. Failure to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily constitute a violation of the Anti-Kickback Law, although the arrangement would be subject to scrutiny by regulators and prosecutors and would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Many states have their own Medicaid anti-kickback laws and several states also have anti-kickback laws that apply to all payors (i.e., not just government health care programs).
 
From time-to-time, the OIG issues alerts and other guidance on certain practices in the health care industry that implicate the Anti-Kickback Law or other federal fraud and abuse laws. Violations of other fraud and abuse laws also can result in exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. One basis for such exclusion is an individual or entity’s submission of claims to Medicare or Medicaid that are substantially in excess of that individual or entity’s usual charges for like items or services. In 2003, the OIG issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would have defined the terms “usual charges” and “substantially in excess” in ways that might have required providers, including the Company, to either lower their charges to Medicare and Medicaid or increase charges to certain other payors to avoid the risk of exclusion. On June 18, 2007, the OIG withdrew the proposed rule, saying it preferred to continue evaluating billing patterns on a case-by-case basis. In its withdrawal notice, the OIG also said it “remains concerned about disparities in the amounts charged to Medicare and Medicaid when compared to private payors,” that it continues to believe its exclusion authority for excess charges “provides useful backstop protection for the public fiscal from providers that routinely charge Medicare or Medicaid substantially more than their other customers” and that it will continue to use “all tools available … to address instances where Medicare or Medicaid are charged substantially more than other payors.” Thus, although the OIG did not proceed with its rulemaking, an enforcement action under this statutory exclusion basis is possible and, if pursued, could have an adverse effect on the Company. The enforcement by Medicaid officials of similar state law restrictions also could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
Under another federal statute, known as the “Stark Law” or “self-referral” prohibition, physicians who have a financial or a compensation relationship with a clinical laboratory may not, unless an exception applies, refer Medicare patients for testing to the laboratory, regardless of the intent of the parties. Similarly, laboratories may not bill Medicare for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited self-referral. There are several Stark Law exceptions that are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including: 1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; 2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; 3) an exception for certain ancillary services (including laboratory services) provided within the referring physician’s own office, if certain criteria are satisfied; 4) physician investment in a company whose stock is traded on a public exchange and; 5) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that are set at a fair market value rate and satisfy other requirements. All of the requirements of a Stark Law exception must be met in order for the exception to apply. Many states have their own self-referral laws, which in some cases apply to all patient referrals, not just Medicare.

There are a variety of other types of federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including laws prohibiting submission of false or fraudulent claims. The Company takes all laws and regulations applicable to its industry very seriously, and conducts its business in compliance with all applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws. The Company is unable to predict how these laws will be applied in the future, and as such, the Company gives no assurances that its arrangements will not be subject to scrutiny under such laws. Sanctions for violations of these laws may include exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal or state health care programs, significant criminal and civil fines and penalties, and loss of licensure. Any exclusion from participation in a federal health care program, or any loss of licensure, arising from any action by any federal or state regulatory or enforcement authority, would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. Any significant criminal or civil penalty resulting from such proceedings could also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
 
Reimbursement Laws
 
Medicare beneficiaries’ access to laboratory testing will be integral to the industry’s growth over the next five years. In April 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 was enacted into law, which will significantly affect the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (“CLFS”). Most diagnostic services are assigned a code under the Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) coding system created by the American Medical Association in 1966. Typically, the CPT code is a five-digit number that is assigned to an item or service with genetic tests billed using CPT laboratory and pathology codes. In 1984, Congress authorized the creation of the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule for clinical laboratory services. The CLFS is, in reality, many fee schedules, as each carrier is required to establish its own schedule. Payments allowable under the CLFS were to be adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index, an index that grew at a rate below the rate of inflation for medical goods and services. One year later, Congress established a National Limitation Amount (NLA) to establish a cap on fees for laboratory services. Following establishment of the NLA, the maximum allowable charge for laboratory services covered by Medicare was the lesser of the provider’s charge for the service, the applicable carrier’s fee schedule amount, or the NLA. Starting in 2017, Medicare payments for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests will be determined by a market-based payment system, effectively basing Medicare payments on the weighted median of private payors’ payment rates for each test. Overall, the Congressional Budget Office (“CBO”) projects that these reforms to the CLFS will cut Medicare spending by $1.0 billion between 2014 and 2019 and an additional $2.5 billion from 2020 to 2024. Overall, this legislation will require laboratories to report variations in payment rates, such as varying payments across payors, thus likely translating to fewer discrepancies in payments. Diagnostic and medical laboratories will likely contend with increasingly competitive reimbursement rates. Laboratories can be fined up to $10,000 per day for failing to report or misrepresenting laboratory payments.
 
The Company’s telehealth products are used for medical purposes generally covered by government or private health plans. In general, a third-party payor only covers a medical product or procedure when the plan administrator is satisfied that the product or procedure improves health outcomes, including quality of life or functional ability, in a safe and cost-effective manner. Even if a device has received clearance or approval for marketing by the FDA, there is no assurance that third-party payors will cover the cost of the device and related procedures. In many instances, third-party payors use price schedules that do not vary to reflect the cost of the products and equipment used in performing those procedures. In other instances, payment or reimbursement is separately available for the products and equipment used, in addition to payment or reimbursement for the procedure itself. Even if coverage is available, third-party payors may place restrictions on the circumstances where they provide coverage or may offer reimbursement that is not sufficient to cover the cost of the Company’s products. Third-party payors who cover the cost of medical products or equipment and allow a general charge for the procedure, often maintain lists of exclusive suppliers or approved lists of products deemed to be cost-effective. Authorization from those third-party payors is required prior to using products that are not on these lists as a condition of reimbursement. If the Company’s products are not on the approved lists, healthcare providers must determine if the additional cost and effort required for prior authorization, and the uncertainty of actually obtaining coverage, is justified by any perceived clinical benefits from using these products. If hospitals and physicians cannot obtain adequate reimbursement for AHC’s products or the procedures in which they are used, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could suffer a material adverse impact.

The Medicaid program is a joint state-federal medical assistance program established and governed by Title XIX of the Social Security Act. The program provides assistance to more than fifty million Americans, approximately half of whom are children. The federal government has established broad guidelines for the program. States are free to administer their programs and to establish their own eligibility standards, type and scope of services, and payment rates. States must provide Medicaid benefits to certain individuals who are deemed “categorically needy;” most of these individuals are indigent women and children, and people receiving Social Security disability benefits. States may also provide benefits to individuals who are not “categorically needy” but who are deemed to be in need of assistance. Children who do not qualify for benefits under Medicaid may be eligible to participate in the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. Medicaid programs also are substantial payors for care provided in skilled nursing facilities. Given this mix of beneficiaries, Medicaid programs are important payors for items and services that are needed by women, children and nursing home residents.
 
Under the Medicaid program states are required to cover inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physician services, childhood vaccines, and certain laboratory and imaging services. Each state has its own drug testing laws, which limits the extent to which large-scale toxicology laboratories can enter the market and cater to demand throughout the United States.
 
The Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (“EPSDT”) benefit provides comprehensive and preventive health care services for children under age 21 who are enrolled in Medicaid. States are required to provide comprehensive services and furnish all Medicaid coverable, appropriate, and medically necessary services needed to correct and ameliorate health conditions, based on certain federal guidelines. Laboratory testing is covered under EPSDT. States are required to provide any additional health care services that are coverable under the Federal Medicaid program and found to be medically necessary to treat, correct or reduce illnesses and conditions discovered regardless of whether the service is covered in a state’s Medicaid plan. It is the responsibility of states to determine medical necessity on a case-by-case basis Private payors are likely to consider the following in making coverage decisions regarding genetic tests: current signs and symptoms of the disease the test is intended to diagnose or rule out; personal or family history or risk factors for the disease; whether the test is considered to be investigational or experimental; the site at which the test will be performed; and whether the test will influence management or treatment of the disease.
 
Like Medicare, private insurers are beginning to show interest in the use of scientific or medical evidence as a basis for coverage decisions. Some private payors are using a formalized technology assessment process to evaluate new tests and treatments. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield employs a Technology Evaluation Center, the function and goals of which closely resemble Medicare’s Technology Assessment process.
 
Many private payors have adopted the use of CPT codes and a laboratory fee schedule, making their processes similar to what Medicare employs. Some payors adopt the Medicare approach on an almost wholesale basis, agreeing to pay providers, for example, “95% of the Medicare Fee Schedule.”
 
The Toxicology Laboratories industry is subject to a heavy level of federal, state and local regulation. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regulates all laboratory testing (except research) performed on humans in the United States through the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). CLIA extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency. Pursuant to CLIA, clinical laboratories must meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards. Labs must also undergo proficiency testing by the College of American Pathologists and are subject to inspections. All clinical laboratories must be properly certified to receive Medicare or Medicaid payments. Drug testing for public-sector employees, a staple of the Toxicology Laboratories industry, is regulated by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which has established detailed performance and quality standards that laboratories must meet in order to be approved to perform drug testing on employees of federal government contractors and certain other entities.

Management believes that the regulatory landscape, particularly reimbursement rates set by the laboratory fee schedule, will likely become more stringent over the next five years. Starting in 2017, Medicare’s fee schedule will be determined by private payor rates, with more favorable reimbursements for single-source proprietary tests. This change will likely lower the incidence of pain physicians demanding a multitude of high-tech tests for detecting whether or not Medicare beneficiaries use specific drugs. As a result, there will likely be rising demand for proprietary toxicology tests that test for numerous drugs simultaneously.
 
Health Care Reform
 
On March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law. Together, the two measures made fundamental changes to the U.S. healthcare system. These laws included a large number of provisions that significantly altered the healthcare industry, including expanding Medicaid eligibility, requiring most individuals to have health insurance, establishing new regulations on health plans, establishing health insurance exchanges, requiring manufacturers to report payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and modifying certain payment systems to encourage more cost-effective care and a reduction of inefficiencies and waste, including through new tools to address fraud and abuse.
 
While the laboratory industry agreed to a five-year annual rate reduction of 1.75% to the Medicare clinical lab fee schedule under healthcare reform, the long-term positives are expected to outweigh this reduction. Healthcare coverage has been mandated since 2010, which has stimulated laboratory testing volumes. The PPACA’s inclusion of laboratory services as part of the basic coverage for those currently uninsured will increase the number of patients with access to industry services. Under the PPACA, Medicare will cover the entire cost of preventive services, such as screening tests. All private health plans must also provide coverage for preventive services. In 2013, a 2.3% excise tax on the sale by manufacturers, producers and importers of certain medical devices that are not exempted from such tax was imposed under these health care reform laws. As administrative rules implementing healthcare reform under the legislation are not yet finalized or have been modified, the impact of the healthcare reform legislation on the Company is unknown, and there can be no assurances that healthcare reform legislation will not adversely impact either the operational results or the manner in which the Company operates the business. Healthcare industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions, including investments in our solutions and services.
 
Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. The Company cannot predict the exact effect newly enacted laws or any future legislation or regulation will have on us. However, the implementation of new legislation and regulation may lower reimbursements for the Company’s products, reduce medical procedure volumes and adversely affect the business, possibly materially.
 
Regulation of Medical Devices
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local levels and foreign countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, sampling, marketing, and import and export of medical devices. Various federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations also govern testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, distribution and record-keeping related to such products and their marketing. The process of obtaining these approvals and clearances, and the subsequent process of maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations can require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Statutes, rules, regulations and policies may change and new legislation or regulations may be issued that could delay such approvals.

Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, medical devices are classified into one of three classes: Class I, Class II or Class III. The classification of a device into one of these three classes generally depends on the degree of risk associated with the medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Class I and II devices must be able to demonstrate safety and efficacy by adhering to a set of general controls, including compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, which sets forth good manufacturing practice requirements: facility registration, device listing and product reporting of adverse medical events, truthful and non-misleading labeling, and promotion of the device only for its cleared or approved intended uses. Class II devices are also subject to these general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is typically accomplished through the 510(k) pre-market notification procedure. When 510(k) clearance is sought, a sponsor must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class II device (for example, a device previously cleared through the 510(k) pre-market notification process). If the FDA agrees that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, then 510(k) clearance to market will be granted. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require pre-market approval, or PMA. The FDA has categorized the AHC telehealth product as a Class II device.
 
Both before and after a medical device is commercially distributed, manufacturers and marketers of the device have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Device manufacturers are subject to periodic and unannounced inspection by the FDA for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, which sets forth the current good manufacturing practice requirements that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, servicing, labeling, storage, installation and distribution of all finished medical devices intended for human use. FDA regulations prohibit the advertising and promotion of a medical device for any use outside the scope of a 510(k) clearance or PMA approval or for unsupported safety or effectiveness claims. Although the FDA does not regulate physicians’ practice of medicine, the FDA does regulate manufacturer communications with respect to off-label use. If the FDA finds that a manufacturer has failed to comply with FDA laws and regulations or that a medical device is ineffective or poses an unreasonable health risk, it can institute or seek a wide variety of enforcement actions and remedies, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe actions such as:
 

• | fines, injunctions and civil penalties;
--+----------------------------------------


• | recall or seizure of products;
--+-------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals already granted; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 
The FDA also has the authority to require repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device.
 
Health and Environmental Laws
 
AEON’s testing business is subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. For example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the U.S. This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needlestick injuries. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service, the U.S. Postal Service and the International Air Transport Association. AEON generally uses third-party vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and radioactive materials, and contractually requires them to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

Employees
 
At June 30, 2017, the Company had approximately 83 full-time employees, 29 independent contractors, and 25 independent sales representatives or distribution groups. The Company has no collective bargaining agreements with unions covering its employees, and believes that its overall relations with its employees are good.
Certain Transactions
 
Earn-out Payments
 
In accordance with the Merger Agreement, the members of AEON prior to the effective time of the AEON Acquisition became holders of shares of AHC common stock, issuable in tranches as described in below. Additionally, the AEON Acquisition requires certain Earn-out Payments (as defined and described below) to be paid to the former members of AEON upon achievement of certain financial milestones. The Earn-out Payments must be paid in shares of AHC common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, among other things:

• | Following the AEON Acquisition, AEON is operated as a separate entity.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The former members of AEON prior to the effective time of the AEON Acquisition became holders of shares of AHC common stock issuable in tranches as follows (the payments referred to in (b), (c), (d) and (e) below are hereinafter be referred to as the “Earn-out Payments”):
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(a) | At the closing of the AEON Acquisition, the membership interests of AEON were converted into the right to receive such number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of AHC common stock as is equal to 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of AHC common stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) as of the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the closing date of the AEON Acquisition (958,030 total shares of AHC common stock).
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | In December 2016, the Company issued to the former AEON members 240,711 shares of common stock, representing 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of AHC common stock as of the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the closing date of the AEON Acquisition, following the approval of its shareholders of the Earn-out Payments.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | In December 2016, the Company issued to the former AEON members 1,155,415 shares of common stock, representing 24% of the issued and outstanding shares of AHC common stock as of the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the closing date of the AEON Acquisition, due to the determination that AEON achieved at least $16,000,000 in EBITDA for the calendar year ending December 31, 2015.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | In the event AEON achieves at least $65,900,000 in EBITDA, in the aggregate, for the three calendar years ending December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, then, on October 1, 2019, subject to the completion of the audited financial statements of AEON for the calendar year ending December 31, 2018, the Company will issue to the former AEON members such number of additional shares of AHC common stock as is equal to 36.1% of the issued and outstanding shares of AHC common stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) as of the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the closing date of the AEON Acquisition, provided, however, the Company will issue to the former AEON members such number of additional shares of AHC common stock so that the total number of shares of AHC common stock issuable to the former AEON members shall equal 85% of the issued and outstanding AHC common stock on a post-issuance basis (rounded to the nearest whole share) on a Fully Diluted Basis (as defined below).
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(e) | In the event AEON achieves at least $100,000,000 in EBITDA, in the aggregate, for the four calendar years ending December 31, 2019, the Company will issue to the former AEON members such number of shares of AHC common stock which equals an additional 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of AHC common stock on a post-issuance basis (rounded to the nearest whole share), on a Fully Diluted Basis, in addition to the shares of AHC common stock issued to the former AEON members under (b), (c) and (d) above (resulting in the AEON members potentially owning 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of AHC common stock on a post issuance basis and Fully Diluted Basis if all the additional tranches are earned).
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
For purposes of determining the potential number of shares of AHC common stock which may be earned in the future, the term “Fully Diluted Basis” means the aggregate of all outstanding shares of AHC common stock, plus the shares of AHC common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of any derivative security outstanding with a conversion or exercise price of $6.75 or less; in each case on the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the closing date of the AEON Acquisition.
 
The Merger Agreement provides that the former AEON members, as holders of shares of AHC common stock issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement, will have the right to nominate one person to the Company’s board of directors for each 10% of the outstanding shares of AHC common stock beneficially owned by the former AEON members. In the event that a vacancy is created on the board of directors at any time due to the death, disability, retirement, resignation or removal of a director elected by the former AEON members, then the former AEON members shall have the right to nominate an individual to fill such vacancy.
 
Exchange of Notes and Series B Preferred Stock
 
On March 20, 2017, the Company entered into a note exchange agreement with the holders of an aggregate principal amount of $2,170,000 of outstanding promissory notes (the “Original Notes”), which were due and payable, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue the holders of such notes, in consideration of the cancellation of the Original Notes, new promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,545,199, which is equal to the sum of the aggregate principal amount of the Original Notes plus the accrued but unpaid interest on the Original Notes (the “New Notes”). The New Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial conversion price of $2.03 per share. Based on the initial conversion prices, the New Notes are convertible into up to 1,253,792 shares of common stock. If the Company issues or sells shares of its common stock, rights to purchase shares of its common stock, or securities convertible into shares of its common stock for a price per share that is less than the conversion price then in effect, such conversion price will be decreased to equal 85% of such lower price. The foregoing adjustments to the conversion price will not apply to certain exempt issuances, including issuances pursuant to certain employee benefit plans. The conversion price is also subject to adjustment upon stock splits, reverse stock splits, and similar capital changes. All of the New Notes have a maturity date of one year from the closing date. The New Notes were issued in consideration of the exchange of (i) and aggregate principal amount of $950,000 of Original Notes which are currently convertible at a price of $2.25 per share, (ii) an aggregate principal amount of $520,000 of Original Notes which are currently convertible at a price of $3.00 per share, and (iii) an aggregate principal amount of $700,000 of unconvertible Original Notes. As the conversion price of the New Notes is below $2.25, the exercise price of outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 825,184 shares of common stock has been adjusted from $2.70 per share to $2.07 per share.

The New Notes bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum with interest payable upon maturity, the conversion of the New Notes or on any earlier redemption date. Commencing one month after the Company’s common stock is listed for trading on a national securities exchange the Company will have the right to redeem all or any portion of the outstanding principal balance of the New Notes, plus all accrued but unpaid interest at a price equal to 110% of such amount. The holders of the New Notes shall have the right to convert any or the entire amount to be redeemed into common stock prior to redemption. Subject to certain exceptions, the New Notes are senior to existing and future indebtedness of the Company and will be secured by a first priority lien on all of the Company’s assets to the extent and as provided in a Security Agreement entered into between the Company and the holders subject to certain exceptions, the New Notes contain customary covenants against incurring additional indebtedness and granting additional liens and contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the New Notes, the holders may require the Company to repay all or a portion of the note in cash, at a price equal to 110% of the principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 
In connection with the exchange of the Original Notes for the New Notes, the parties agreed that the holder of all of the Company’s outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) would exchange all of its outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock for shares of a new series of convertible preferred stock to be designated as Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series E Preferred Stock”). Accordingly, on March 20, 2017, the Company also entered into a separate exchange agreement with the holder of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock, to exchange such shares for a total of 25,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock. The shares of Series E Preferred Stock will be initially convertible by the holder into an aggregate of 187,500 shares of Common Stock at the initial conversion rate of $4.00 per share. The conversion price of the new preferred stock will be subject to adjustment solely in the event of stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations, and similar corporate events and does not provide for general price-based anti-dilution adjustments. Each share of Series E Preferred Stock will have a stated value of $30.00 per share. On March 20, 2017, the Company filed with the State of Delaware a Certificate of Designations, Rights and Preferences and Number of Shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, referred to as the Series E Designation. The Series E Designation defines the rights and preferences of the Series E Preferred Stock and provides that each share of Series E Preferred Stock will have the following rights and preferences: (i) each holder of the Series E Preferred Stock will have the right, at any time, to convert the shares of Series E Preferred Stock into shares of common stock, (ii) the Series E Preferred Stock will be redeemable at the option of the Company commencing one year after the closing date, provided that the Company’s common stock is listed on a national securities exchange at such time, and (iii) the Series E Preferred Stock will pay dividends at the rate of 5% per annum in cash. Pursuant to the exchange agreement for the preferred stock, the holders of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock agreed to waive all unpaid dividends that had accrued on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock.
