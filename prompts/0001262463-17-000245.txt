ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Company Overview
 
International Leaders Capital Corporation (formerly Star Century Pandaho Corporation) (“SCPD” or "the Company") was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 21, 2009.
 
On May 28, 2017, Star Century Entertainment Corporation, a shareholder of the Company, agreed to sell 25,000 shares of the Company’s Series B preferred shares, representing approximately 99% of the voting control of the Company, to ILC Holdings, LLC, an unrelated third party, and the Company experienced a change in control. At May 28, 2017, ILC Holdings, LLC did not have any operations and had minimal assets and liabilities. In conjunction with the change in control, three individuals were elected to be the Company’s management, and the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, former Chief Operating Officer, and former Director of Public Relations resigned. Effective August 2, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors and a majority of the shareholders of the Company amended the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to (i) change the name of the Company to International Leaders Capital Corporation and (ii) effect a 1-for-50 reverse common stock split. All common stock share and per-share amounts for all periods presented in these financial statements have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the reverse stock split.
 
The Company’s previous majority shareholders had planned to build Pandaho, a cartoon styled character, into a competitive cartoon brand in China and surrounding areas with Pandaho-themed merchandise and multi-media exhibitions. Commensurate with the shareholder transactions on May 28, 2017, the Company plans to operate a financial services firm which provides consulting services for businesses and training programs for general investors. The Company anticipates earning revenue from (1) business training and consulting and (2) jointly investing in quality projects and ventures for companies which we serve. Our professional investment education program commences with a three day intensive program for general investors which is further reinforced with monthly training courses. In addition, we offer a roadshow platform for OTC listed companies which guides clients through the fund raising process.
 
The Company’s headquarters are based in Las Vegas, Nevada with planned primary operation in mainland China and Asia.
