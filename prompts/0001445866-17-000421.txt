Company History 
 
NABUFIT Global, Inc. (“NABUFIT Global” or the “Company”, formerly CryptoSign, Inc., StrategaBiz, Inc., Agricon Global Corporation and Bayhill Capital Corporation), a Delaware Corporation was incorporated in May 1983 in the State of Colorado and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in April 2008.  On November 30, 2015, the Company consummated a transaction evidenced by an Agreement and Plan of Share Exchange (the "Share Exchange Agreement") dated October 8, 2015, by and among the Company, NABUFIT Global ApS, a Danish company (“NABUFIT Denmark”) and Mads H. Frederiksen and Ulrik Møll  (“Shareholder Representatives”), as the representatives of the shareholders holding one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding capital stock of NABUFIT Denmark (collectively, the “NABUFIT Shareholders” and each a “NABUFIT Shareholder”), pursuant to which the Company acquired from the NABUFIT Shareholders all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of NABUFIT Denmark in exchange for 15,500,000 shares of the Company (the “Share Exchange”).  As a result of the Share Exchange, the NABUFIT Shareholders, as the former shareholders of NABUFIT Denmark, became the controlling shareholders of the Company and NABUFIT Denmark became a subsidiary of the Company. The Share Exchange was accounted for as a reverse takeover/recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein NABUFIT Denmark was considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes.  The capital, share price, and earnings per share amount in these consolidated financial statements for the period prior to the reverse merger were restated to reflect the recapitalization in accordance with the exchange ratio established in the merger. 
 
As a result of the Share Exchange, we discontinued our pre-exchange business, acquired the business of NABUFIT Denmark, changed our year end to December 31 and continued the existing business operations of NABUFIT Denmark as a publicly traded company.
 
The Company designs, manufactures and markets the NABUFIT virtual training and fitness products and services, a state-of-the-art online fitness portal (“NABUFIT” or, the “Product”) with the option of connecting existing and future monitoring devices (wearables, etc.) to the Product. The Product incorporates interaction and input through Microsoft® Kinect® and other technologies and the option for personal data collection, coaching and teaching through mentor services.
    Customers obtain access to the Product through the purchase of monthly or annual memberships and the downloading of the software or mobile device application. The Product provides custom designed training plans, diet plans and access to mentors and coaching.
    Through Microsoft® Kinect®, the NABUFIT technology collects data and measures each exercise relatively to a set standard and past performances. Based on the data collection and registration in the Kinect® module the user will receive immediate feedback, e.g. as a percentage, a graphic or an emoticon depending on how well the exercise has been performed. This provides a unique quality assurance ensuring maximum effect of the training. The quick feedback will also reduce the risk of injuries and streamline time spent on training. Users can access training data, statistics and results online or through mobile device applications.

Membership of the portal is divided into two levels – a basic membership and a VIP membership. The difference between the levels of membership is primarily based upon the access to features and to mentors. The basic membership is available at no cost to download while the VIP membership has a monthly fee.
    The Product incorporates and features custom workout and fitness plans designed by professional athletes, trainers and sports stars. In addition, other trainers and participants throughout the world can share plans and results. The Company has entered into contracts with several world-wide sports and training such as Neymar Junior, Mo Farah, Michael Maze and Peter Shmeichel.
 
The portal also offers a social forum for its users, where users can interact with like-minded members and train with them virtually. Some people will experience increased motivation by being part of a group. The member can allow others to see all or part of his profile. The personal profiles of the members can be matched, so the portal will suggest network and training mates, and thereby helping to ensure the optimum composition. It will be possible to do real-time training with training mates by sharing the screen in a videoconference on the portal.
