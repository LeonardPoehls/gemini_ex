ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

Stonegate Mortgage Corporation, an Ohio corporation, is a leading, non-bank mortgage company focused on originating, financing and servicing U.S. residential mortgage loans. The Company was initially incorporated in the State of Indiana in January 2005. As a result of an acquisition and subsequent merger with Swain Mortgage Company ("Swain") in 2009, the Company is now an Ohio corporation. The Company’s headquarters is in Indianapolis, Indiana. We operate as an intermediary between residential mortgage borrowers and the ultimate investors of mortgages through originating, financing, and servicing U.S. residential mortgages. Our integrated and scalable residential mortgage banking platform includes a diversified origination business which includes a network of third party originators consisting of mortgage brokers, mortgage bankers and financial institutions (banks and credit unions), a retail branch network and a direct to consumer call center. We are committed to delivering consistent and sustainable value to our shareholders by constantly improving our overall quality and compliance, maximizing our overall efficiency, productivity, and effectiveness and enhancing our customer and associate satisfaction levels. 
We predominantly transfer mortgage loans into pools of Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae" or "GNMA") mortgage backed securities ("MBS") and sell mortgage loans to the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae" or "FNMA") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac" or "FHLMC"). Both FNMA and FHLMC are considered government-sponsored enterprises ("GSEs"). We typically retain the right to service the mortgage for GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC. We also sell mortgage loans to over a dozen other third-party investors in the secondary market and provide short-term financing through our NattyMac, LLC ("NattyMac") subsidiary to third party correspondent lenders. As of December 31, 2016, we were licensed to originate and service residential mortgage loans in 48 states and the District of Columbia, and we are an approved Seller/Servicer of FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA. 
Proposed Merger with Home Point Financial Corporation 

On January 26, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Home Point Financial Corporation, a New Jersey Corporation (“Home Point Financial”) and Longhorn Merger Sub, Inc. an Ohio corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Home Point Financial (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving entity (the “Merger”). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of our common stock (other than certain excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive $8.00 in cash, without interest, less any applicable tax withholdings, which represents a per share premium of approximately 61 percent over our 90-day volume weighted average price on January 26, 2017 and 34 percent over our closing price per share on January 26, 2017. 

The Company's Board of Directors unanimously approved the Merger following a comprehensive review of the transaction and strategic alternatives. The Merger is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including, among other things, approval by the Company's stockholders and regulatory approvals. The Merger is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2017.
In connection with the Merger Agreement entered into by the Company on January 26, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a Tax Asset Protection Plan (the “Plan”) with Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., as Rights Agent. The Plan is designed to protect the Company's tax assets during the period prior to the closing of the Merger. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $183.0 million in net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Reportable Segments
We operate three identifiable business segments: Originations, Servicing and Financing. This determination is based on our current organizational structure, which reflects how our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our business. Our mortgage origination business generates income primarily through origination fees and gains upon the sale of mortgage loans sourced through our correspondent, wholesale and retail channels. We also provide financing to our correspondent customers and others while they are accumulating loans prior to selling them to aggregators, including ourselves, through our mortgage financing business and we earn interest and fee income for these services. We also have the ability to retain the mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") on the loans we sell and to create a recurring servicing income stream in our mortgage servicing business. We believe our three segments are complementary and provide us with the ability to effectively 
 5

and efficiently source, finance, sell and service mortgage loans. A description of each business segment is presented below with further details and discussion of each segments results of operations and total assets presented in Part II, Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Segment Results from Continuing Operations” and Item 8, "Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 22, Segment Information" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Mortgage Originations 
Our mortgage origination business primarily originates and sells residential mortgage loans, which conform to the underwriting guidelines of the GSEs and government agencies. We also originate and sell loans to third-party investors in the secondary market ("non-agency"), which generally conform to the underwriting guidelines of the GSEs, but may exceed the maximum loan size allowed for single unit properties. 
We are committed to providing our customers with the tools and resources they need to be successful in today's marketplace. During 2015 and 2016, we invested in our technology platform in a dedicated effort to increase efficiencies throughout our origination business, meet the regulatory compliance demands, improve quality and maintain high underwriting standards, and to deliver a superior mortgage product, with exceptional customer service, which distinguishes us from our competitors. We plan to continue to grow our mortgage origination business through this exceptional customer service within our existing portfolio and markets.
We offer the following mortgage loan products:

◦ | Government Mortgage Loans: First-lien mortgage loans secured by single-family residences that are insured by the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA") or guaranteed by the Veterans Administration ("VA") or guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") and are securitized into Ginnie Mae securities.


◦ | Prime1 Conforming Mortgage Loans: Prime credit quality first-lien mortgage loans (i.e., mortgage loans that, in the event of default, have priority over all other liens or claims) secured by single-family residences that meet or “conform” to the underwriting standards established by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac for inclusion in their guaranteed mortgage securities programs.


◦ | Prime1 Non-Conforming Mortgage Loans: Prime credit quality first-lien mortgage loans secured by single-family residences that do not conform to the underwriting standards established by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, because they have original principal amounts exceeding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac limits, which are commonly referred to as jumbo mortgage loans.


◦ | Non-agency Loans: Loans that meet the underwriting standards of our third-party investors in the secondary market.

1 We generally consider prime mortgage loans to be those with Fair Isaac Corporation ("FICO") scores greater than 620.
We originate residential mortgage loans through three channels: correspondent, wholesale and retail. We have continued to diversify our origination business in order to be successful in multiple market scenarios. While the channels are diverse, we constantly focus on quality control and maintaining high underwriting standards. We perform diligence on and underwrite loans through our proprietary technology platform, Stonegate Connect, an integrated, automated risk-based due diligence engine that automates the review process by applying business rules specific to the loan and the seller. We analyze credit, collateral and compliance risk on every loan on a pre-funding or a pre-purchase basis in order to ensure that each loan meets our investors’ standards and any applicable regulatory rules. We also capture loan data and documents associated with the loan from application through sale/securitization and servicing, giving us the ability to run additional business rules that provide indication of loan performance. We believe that the ability to offer greater transparency and data to institutional investors that purchase our loans or securities backed by our loans will provide us with a substantial advantage over our competitors in our sales executions as the mortgage market continues to evolve and we grow our whole loan sales to non-agency investors or we begin to securitize our own non-agency mortgage loans. 
Our three mortgage loan originations channels are discussed in more detail below. 
Correspondent Channel 
We acquire newly originated loans conforming to the underwriting standards of the GSEs or government agencies as well as non-agency mortgage loans conforming to the standards of our investors from our network of correspondents across 48 states plus the District of Columbia. We identify our correspondent customers through a team of relationship managers who are responsible for building and maintaining customer relationships and ensuring that we receive an adequate share of their 
 6

origination volume. We offer our correspondents access to a state-of-the-art technology platform (Stonegate Connect), and warehouse funding through our financing platform NattyMac, through a separate approval process, that offers benefits when selling loans to Stonegate Mortgage. In return, our correspondents provide us with high quality products that meet our underwriting standards and those of our investors. We track the performance of our correspondents on a score-card and terminate relationships where quality and other requirements are not met. We believe that our programs offer correspondents an attractive value proposition, including greater access to capital and liquidity, as they seek to maintain and grow their businesses. 
We conduct financial, operational and risk reviews of each correspondent prior to initially approving them as a customer and on an annual basis to ensure compliance with our guidelines and those of the various agencies that regulate our business. In addition, we conduct background and financial reviews of the principals and their mortgage loan officers. Lastly, our purchase agreements with correspondents include standard representations and warranties to further support the quality of our underwriting and origination process. Our growth has been driven by adding new correspondents as well as deepening relationships with existing correspondents. Our correspondent channel represented 64%, 64% and 66% of our mortgage originations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Originations for this channel were $6.0 billion in 2016, $7.2 billion in 2015 and $7.9 billion in 2014. The decrease in percentage of our overall portfolio partially arises from increased pricing competition within the channel. To offset the impact of increased competitive pricing within this channel, we will focus our future efforts on re-engaging established dormant customers to further increase our origination volume with them. We believe that as we continue to increase our coverage of correspondents, and mature in existing as well as enter new markets, we will continue to increase our correspondent loan volume. 

Wholesale Channel
We provide a variety of agency, government insured and non-agency mortgage loan products to approved brokers to allow them to better service their borrowers. Before approving a mortgage broker for business, we focus on several attributes including origination volume, quality of originations and tangible net worth. We also conduct financial and background checks on the principals and their mortgage loan officers through various third-party sources. Once we begin acquiring loans from our mortgage brokers, we track the performance of the loans on an on-going basis and terminate business relationships if the loans consistently do not perform or if there is evidence of misrepresentation. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not terminate any significant relationships due to our continued focus on underwriting loans and ensuring compliance with policies. We expect to see a continued increase in our non-agency mortgage loan originations, which provide innovative products that meet borrowers' demands and investors' return thresholds. Accordingly, we expect we will expand our settlements of non-agency loans through sales to the whole loan market or private label securitizations to third party investors at a future date. 
Through our wholesale channel, we originate loans through a network of approximately 594 non-exclusive relationships with various approved mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. This channel accounted for 23%, 23% and 24% of our originations from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Originations from continuing operations for this channel were $2.1 billion in 2016, $2.6 billion in 2015 and $2.8 billion in 2014. Mortgage brokers identify applicants, help them complete a loan application, gather required information and documents and act as our liaison with the borrower during the lending process. We review and underwrite an application submitted by a broker, accept or reject the application, determine the range of interest rates and other loan terms, and fund the loan upon acceptance by the borrower and satisfaction of all conditions to the loan in much the same manner as our retail channel. By relying on brokers to market our products and assist the borrower throughout the loan application process, we can increase loan volume through our wholesale channel with proportionately lower investment in overhead costs compared with the costs of increasing loan volume through loan originations in our distributed retail channels. 
Retail Channel 
In this channel, mortgage advisors, as employees of Stonegate, either originate loans through their relationships with local real estate agents, builders, telemarketers and other local contacts in one of our retail branch offices, or work in our Stonegate Direct division, a call center that purchases leads for mortgage loans and works directly with consumers over the phone. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we decreased our retail branch footprint, to better manage the expenses associated with retail originations. As of December 31, 2016, our retail channel primarily operated through 12 retail offices across 7 states as compared to 21 retail offices across 11 states as of December 31, 2015. This channel accounted for 13%, 13% and 10% of our originations from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Originations from continuing operations for this channel were $1.2 billion in 2016, $1.5 billion in 2015 and $1.2 billion in 2014. With our remaining physical branch locations, we continue to focus on increasing our profitability through the hiring of additional advisors and leveraging within existing markets. Stonegate Direct provides consumers across the United States with direct access to mortgage advisors to facilitate nonstop access to our mortgage products and services. The creation of this division greatly enhances and simplifies the customer experience and home loan application process for qualified customers by providing quick, secure, online access for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. The creation of this division is part of 
 7

our initiative to deliver a superior mortgage product and exceptional customer service that are our points of distinction from competitors in the marketplace. 
Mortgage Servicing 
Our mortgage servicing business is organized to maintain a high quality servicing portfolio and keep delinquency rates below the industry average. We perform loan administration, collection and default activities, including the collection and remittance of loan payments, responding to customer inquiries, investor accounting for principal and interest, holding custodial (impound) funds for the payment of property taxes and insurance premiums, counseling delinquent mortgagors, modifying loans and supervising foreclosures and our property dispositions. We focus on optimizing our operating platform technology, external interfaces related to the support of our default areas and continuous review of our internal processes to increase efficiencies, improve our performance quality, meet regulatory compliance demands, and support our ability for continued growth. 
Our servicing model, along with Stonegate Direct, is very focused on “recapture,” which involves actively working with existing borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans with Stonegate if it is advantageous for the borrower. When a loan is paid off or refinanced with a different lender, we lose the servicing fees on the loan, so our ability to recapture loans successfully is important to the longevity of our servicing cash flows. Because the refinanced loans typically have lower interest rates or lower monthly payments, and, in general, subsequently refinance more slowly and default less frequently, these refinancings also typically improve the overall quality of our servicing portfolio. 
Our servicing business produces strong recurring, contractual fee-based revenue with minimal credit risk. Servicing fees are primarily based on the aggregate unpaid principal balance ("UPB") of the loans serviced and the payment structure varies by loan source and type. These include differences in rate of servicing fees as a percentage of UPB and in the structure of advances. We believe our origination business gives us a distinct advantage in building a high-quality portfolio of MSRs over those who rely heavily on purchasing MSRs from others to build their portfolios as originated portfolios generally perform better given the extensive diligence and underwriting procedures that we apply to each loan. In addition, there is a tax benefit associated with originated MSRs in that no MSRs asset is created and tax income is derived from the servicing revenue as opposed to an asset being created and amortized over a set period of time for purchased MSRs.
We service loans using a model designed to improve loan performance and reduce loan defaults and foreclosures. Our servicing portfolio consists of MSRs we retain from loans that we originate and MSRs we acquire from third party originators, including in transactions facilitated by GSEs. The loans we service are typically securitized by us, i.e., the loans have been pooled together with multiple other loans and interests have been sold to third party investors that are secured by loans in the securitization pool. We are prepared to act either as a retainer or a seller, and/or subservicer, of MSRs, depending on existing market conditions and our liquidity needs. We successfully executed on this strategy by selling nearly $6.9 billion, $8.8 billion and $3.8 billion in MSRs during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The table below contains information related to the mortgage loans in our servicing portfolio as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:

 | December 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015
Servicing portfolio ($UPB in thousands) | $ | 16,286,839 | | | $ | 17,520,731
Weighted average coupon | 3.72 | % | | 4.02 | %
Weighted average age (in months) | 17 | | | 16 | 
90+ day delinquency rate | 0.83 | % | | 0.60 | %
Weighted average FICO score | 722 | | | 725 | 
Gross constant prepayment rate 1 | 17.11 | % | | 18.00 | %

Mortgage Financing 
Our fully integrated financing platform, known as NattyMac, is a wholly-owned subsidiary providing warehouse financing to Stonegate Mortgage correspondent customers and other approved mortgage bankers. Natty Mac allows us to leverage our proprietary technology and our existing due diligence and underwriting processes to efficiently underwrite the warehouse lines of credit it provides for its customers. We believe that NattyMac is highly scalable with little additional fixed cost investment needed to grow our customer base. This also creates an additional source of funding for our correspondents to 
 8

originate mortgage loans that meet our underwriting requirements and are eligible for purchase by Stonegate Mortgage, as well as other investors. We are currently financing NattyMac’s warehouse lending operations by selling a participating interest in the warehouse line of credit to an approved third party institution. 
Our financing platform features a centralized custodian and disbursement agent allowing us to enter into participation arrangements with financial institutions, such as regional banks, for an interest in our newly originated warehouse lines of credit. By offering regional banks an opportunity to invest in a liquid high-quality asset, we are able to earn net interest income. By partnering with regional banks and other investors, we believe it allows us to compete with other bank-owned warehouse lenders who have traditionally dominated this market. We are also able to share in the interest income with the regional banks and other investors to increase revenue. On April 15, 2014, we entered into an agreement whereby we invested in the subordinate debt of Merchants Bancorp, which, in turn, agreed to capitalize NattyMac Funding, Inc. (“NMF”) to invest in participation interests in warehouse lines of credit originated by us. We participate in the earnings of NMF alongside Merchants Bancorp. 
As of December 31, 2016, NattyMac had 102 approved warehouse customers, with commitments of $561.3 million. 
Significant Transactions and Recent Developments 
(Dollar Amounts In Thousands or As Otherwise Stated Herein)

MSR Sales
In 2015, we entered into a flow sale agreement for the sale of MSRs in GNMA loans to an unrelated party. The sales occurred monthly during the covered period, from September 2015 through April 2016. The characteristics of the pools sold are similar to those associated with the Company's current GNMA production.
On June 30, 2016, we completed a bulk sale of MSRs with an underlying unpaid principal balance of $5.1 billion in FNMA and FHLMC loans to an unrelated party. This pool of MSRs had average mortgage interest rates that were higher than current mortgage rates, and did not include any GNMA MSRs, which have a different historical performance than FNMA and FHLMC MSRs.
On September 30, 2016, we completed a bulk sale of MSRs with an underlying unpaid principal balance of $1.2 billion in GNMA loans to an unrelated party. This pool of MSRs had average mortgage interest rates that were higher than current mortgage rates, and did not include any FNMA and FHLMC MSRs, which have a different historical performance than GNMA MSRs.
Finance Related Transactions
On February 29, 2016, we amended our mortgage repurchase financing with Bank of America, N.A. to decrease the amount available under the line from $400,000 to $300,000 and on March 31, 2016, we amended our mortgage gestation repurchase financing with Bank of America, N.A. to decrease the amount available under the line from $300,000 to $250,000, decreasing the maximum borrowing capacity of the mortgage funding arrangements with Bank of America from $700,000 to $550,000. 

On March 1, 2016, we amended our mortgage repurchase financing with EverBank to decrease the amount available under the line from $150,000 to $125,000, and decrease the MSR sublimit from $70,000 to $60,000. On October 24, 2016, we amended this facility to extend the maturity date to January 7, 2017. On January 6, 2017 we amended our mortgage repurchase financing agreement with EverBank to extend the maturity date to January 5, 2018. 
On June 3, 2016, we amended our mortgage repurchase financing agreement with Bank of America, N.A. to extend the maturity date to July 8, 2016, which was subsequently extended through August 5, 2016. On August 3, 2016, we renewed and amended this agreement to extend the maturity date to August 2, 2017.  The renewed agreement has a repurchase facility size of $200,000 and a gestation facility size of $225,000.  The repurchase and gestation facility sizes were $250,000 and $300,000, respectively, prior to the renewal.
On June 17, 2016, we amended our operating line of credit agreement with Merchants to temporarily increase the maximum borrowing capacity from $5,000 to $10,000 through August 31, 2016, which was extended on August 30, 2016 through November 15, 2016 when it reverted back to $5,000. On November 30, 2016, we renewed at $10,000 through January 15, 2017, reverting to $5,000 after January 15, 2017 through the remainder of the renewal period. On December 31, 2016 we renewed our operating line of credit agreement with Merchants at $10,000 through the remainder of the term set for July 31, 2017. 
 9

On July 29, 2016, we amended our master participation agreement, warehouse and security agreement and operating line of credit facilities with Merchants to extend their maturity dates to July 31, 2017.
On December 15, 2016, we amended our master repurchase agreement with Barclays to extend the maturity date to February 20, 2017. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 863 employees, all of whom are based in the United States. We are not aware that any of our employees is a member of any labor union, we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced any business interruption as a result of any labor dispute. 
Regulation 
Our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. Our loan originations, loan servicing and debt collection operations are primarily regulated at the state level by state licensing authorities and administrative agencies. Because we do business in 48 states and the District of Columbia, we, along with certain of our employees who engage in regulated activities, must apply for licensing as a mortgage banker or lender, loan servicer, mortgage loan originator and/or debt default specialist, pursuant to applicable state law. These laws typically require that we file applications and pay certain processing fees to be approved to operate in a particular state, and that our principals and loan originators be subject to background checks, administrative review and continuing education requirements. Our mortgage servicing business is licensed (or maintains an appropriate statutory exemption) to service mortgage loans in 48 states and the District of Columbia. Our retail loan origination channel is licensed to originate loans in the states in which it operates, and our direct origination channel is licensed to originate loans in 44 states and the District of Columbia. From time to time, we receive requests from states and other agencies for records, documents and information regarding our policies, procedures and practices regarding our loan originations, loan servicing and debt collection business activities, and we are subject to periodic examinations by state regulatory agencies. We incur ongoing costs to comply with these licensing requirements. 
The federal Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 also requires all states to enact laws requiring each individual who takes mortgage loan applications, or who offers or negotiates terms of a residential mortgage loan, to be individually licensed or registered as a mortgage loan originator. These laws require each mortgage loan originator to enroll in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System, apply for individual licenses with the state where they operate, complete a minimum of 20 hours of pre-licensing education and an annual minimum of eight hours of continuing education, and to successfully complete both national and state exams. 
In addition to licensing requirements, we must comply with a number of federal consumer protection laws, including, among others: 

◦ | the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which requires us to maintain privacy with respect to certain consumer data in our possession and to periodically communicate with consumers on privacy matters;


◦ | the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which regulates the timing and content of debt collection communications;


◦ | the Truth in Lending Act ("TILA") and Regulation Z thereunder, which require certain disclosures to mortgagors regarding the terms of their mortgage loans;


◦ | the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use and reporting of information related to the credit history of consumers;


◦ | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B thereunder, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of age, race and certain other characteristics, in the extension of credit;


◦ | the Homeowners Equity Protection Act, which requires, among other things, the cancellation of mortgage insurance once certain equity levels are reached;


◦ | the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C thereunder, which require mortgage lenders to report certain public loan data;


◦ | the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, sex, national origin, and certain other characteristics;

 10


◦ | the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ("RESPA") and Regulation X, which governs certain mortgage loan origination activities and practices and the actions of servicers related to escrow accounts, transfers, lender-placed insurance, loss mitigation, error resolution and other customer communications; and


◦ | certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the Consumer Financial Protection Act, which among other things, created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") and prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, as further described below.

Dodd-Frank Act 
On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act which regulates the financial services industry, including securitizations, mortgage originations and mortgage sales. The Dodd-Frank Act also established the CFPB to enforce laws involving consumer financial products and services, including mortgage finance. The CFPB directly influences the regulation of residential mortgage loan originations and servicing in a number of ways. First, the CFPB has rulemaking authority with respect to many of the federal consumer protection laws applicable to mortgage servicers, including TILA, RESPA and the FDCPA. Second, the CFPB has supervision, examination and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services offered by certain non-depository institutions and large insured depository institutions. The CFPB’s jurisdiction includes those persons originating, brokering or servicing residential mortgage loans and those persons performing loan modification or foreclosure relief services in connection with such loans. 
The Dodd-Frank Act also directs the federal banking agencies and the Securities and Exchange Commission to adopt rules requiring an issuer or other entity creating an asset-backed security (including a mortgage-backed security) to retain an economic interest in a portion of the credit risk for the assets underlying the security. In 2014, the agencies approved a credit risk retention rule that requires sponsors of securitizations retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the assets. The approved rule provides sponsors with various options for meeting this requirement, including retaining risk equal to at least 5% of each class of asset-backed security, 5% of par value of all asset-backed security interests issued, 5% of a representative pool of assets, or a combination of these options. Under this rule, asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by qualified residential mortgages would not be subject to these requirements. The rule defines qualified residential mortgages to have the same meaning as the term “qualified mortgage” as defined by TILA. The rule also recognizes that the sponsor of a FNMA or FHLMC securitization will satisfy the rule’s risk-retention provisions, at least while those agencies remain in conservatorship or receivership with capital support from the U.S. government, because of their 100% guarantee of principal and interest payable on the sponsored securities. Because substantially all of our loans are sold to, or pursuant to programs sponsored by, FNMA, FHLMC, or GNMA, the approved rule would exempt us from the risk-retention requirements with regard to securities backed by such loans.

In addition, on August 1, 2014 the CFPB promulgated the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule that integrates the mortgage loan disclosures required under TILA and sections 4 and 5 of RESPA. The TILA-RESPA rule contains new requirements and two disclosure forms that borrowers will receive in the process of applying for and consummating a mortgage loan. The first new disclosure form, the Loan Estimate, combines two existing forms, the good faith estimate and the initial truth-in lending disclosure, into one form. The loan estimate must be provided to consumers no later than the third business day after they submit a loan application. The rule defines a loan application as having six of the seven elements that RESPA required: consumer’s name, consumer’s income, consumer’s social security number to obtain a credit report, property address, estimate of the value of the property and mortgage loan amount sought. The second new disclosure form, the Closing Disclosure, also combines two existing forms, the settlement statement or HUD-1 and the final truth-in-lending disclosures, into one form. The Closing Disclosure must be provided to consumers at least three business days before consummation of the loan. There are also new tolerance levels for disclosed estimates and restrictions on fees and actions taken before the consumer has received the loan estimate and indicated an intent to proceed with the mortgage loan origination. These forms are designed to use clear language to make it easier for consumers to locate key information, such as interest rate, monthly payments, and costs to close the loan. They also provide more information to assist consumers in deciding whether they can afford the loan and to facilitate comparison of the cost of different loan offers. The implementation of these new forms and related requirements has necessitated significant operational and technological expenses and changes for the entire mortgage origination industry, and for our mortgage origination business in particular. The rule became effective October 3, 2015.
We continue to evaluate all aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations issued thereunder. The burden associated with monitoring and complying with these regulations has increased our compliance costs and may restrict our origination and servicing operations, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We continue to enhance and build our technology capabilities to drive greater efficiency in our compliance efforts.

Mortgage Origination 
On January 10, 2014, the CFPB implemented final rules for the “ability to repay” requirement in the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules, among other things, require lenders to consider a consumer’s ability to repay a mortgage loan before extending credit to the consumer, and limit prepayment penalties. The rules also establish certain protections from liability for mortgage lenders with regard to the “qualified mortgages” they originate. For this purpose, the rules define a “qualified mortgage” to include a loan with a borrower debt-to-income ratio of less than or equal to 43% or, alternatively, a loan eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac while they operate under Federal conservatorship or receivership, and loans eligible for insurance or guarantee by the FHA, VA or USDA. Additionally, a qualified mortgage may not: (i) contain excess upfront points and fees; (ii) have a term greater than 30 years; or (iii) include interest-only or negative amortization payments. These rules have not significantly impacted our mortgage production operations since most of the loans we currently originate are “qualified mortgages” under the rules, and we have made, and continue to make, assessments of each consumer’s ability to repay a mortgage loan before extending credit to that consumer. Nonetheless, to the extent we originate non-“qualified mortgages”, either inadvertently or purposefully, and we are found to have failed to make a reasonable and good faith determination of a borrower’s ability to repay any such loan, we could be subject to additional civil or criminal penalties including substantial fines, imprisonment for individual responsible parties, and statutory penalties payable to the borrower equal to the sum the borrower’s actual damages, twice the amount of the related finance charges up to $4,000, the actual amount of finance charges or fees paid by the borrower (unless we show our failure to comply is not material), and the borrower’s attorney’s fees and other costs in connection with the related litigation. 
Mortgage Servicing 
Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act imposes a number of additional requirements on servicers of residential mortgage loans by amending certain existing provisions and adding new sections to TILA and RESPA. The penalties for noncompliance with TILA and RESPA are also significantly increased by the Dodd-Frank Act and could lead to an increase in lawsuits against mortgage servicers. To that end, on January 10, 2014, the CFPB implemented final rules creating uniform standards for the mortgage servicing industry. The rules increase requirements for communications with borrowers, address requirements around the maintenance of customer account records, govern procedural requirements for responding to written borrower requests and complaints of errors, and provide guidance around servicing of delinquent loans, foreclosure proceedings and loss mitigation efforts, among other measures. Since becoming effective, these rules have increased costs to service loans across the mortgage industry. 
Several state agencies overseeing the mortgage industry have entered into settlements and enforcement consent orders with mortgage servicers regarding certain foreclosure practices. These settlements and orders generally require servicers, among other things, to: (i) modify their servicing and foreclosure practices, for example, by improving communications with borrowers and prohibiting dual-tracking, which occurs when servicers continue to pursue foreclosure during the loan modification process; (ii) establish a single point of contact for borrowers throughout the loan modification and foreclosure processes; and (iii) establish robust oversight and controls of third party vendors, including outside legal counsel, that provide default management or foreclosure services on their behalf. Many of these practices are considered by regulators, investors and consumer advocates as industry "best practices." As such, we will be challenged to review and adapt many of these practices as well.
Competition 
In our originations, servicing and financing businesses, we compete with large financial institutions and with other independent residential mortgage loan producers and servicers. These originators and servicers, however, are experiencing higher operating costs and increased capital requirements, thus allowing an opportunity for us to successfully compete and take advantage of growth opportunities in the mortgage sector. 
Our mortgage loan origination business faces competition in mortgage loan offerings, rates, fees and level of customer service and technological innovation and efficiency. Our ability to differentiate the value of our financial products primarily through our mortgage loan offerings, technology platforms, rates, fees and customer service determines our competitive position within the mortgage loan originations industry. 
Our servicing business faces competition in areas such as fees, service and technological innovation and efficiency. Our ability to differentiate ourselves from other loan servicers through our innovative technology platforms largely determines our competitive position within the mortgage loan servicing industry. 
In our financing business, we primarily compete with depository institutions that use deposit funds to finance loans. These institutions, however, typically only focus on larger mortgage originations leaving the small- and mid-sized originators to sell mortgage loans to aggregators (a depository institution or non-bank originator), such as ourselves. Thus, our financing platform allows us to compete with bank-owned mortgage lenders, who have access to cheaper deposit funding.

Seasonality 
Our Originations segment is subject to seasonal fluctuations, and activity tends to diminish somewhat in the months of December, January and February, when home sales volume and loan origination volumes are at their lowest. This typically causes seasonal fluctuations in our origination business revenue, as well as our financing business revenue in our Financing segment, as such revenue is mostly interest income and directly correlates to originations. Levels of delinquency are also subject to seasonal fluctuations, with higher levels occurring December through March, which can negatively affect the profitability of our Servicing segment due to larger amounts of servicing advances and increased expenses from operational efforts dedicated to servicing delinquent loans.
