Reorganization
On July 20, 2016 (the "Bankruptcy Petition Date"), Novation and three of its subsidiaries, NovaStar Mortgage LLC, NovaStar Mortgage Funding Corporation and 2114 Central LLC (collectively, the “Debtors”), filed voluntary petitions (the Bankruptcy Petitions") for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland (the "Bankruptcy Court"). The Debtors’ Chapter 11 cases (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) were being jointly administered under the case Novation Companies, Inc., et al, No. 16-19745-DER. 
The Company and one of its subsidiaries subsequently filed with the Bankruptcy Court, and amended, a plan of reorganization for the resolution of the outstanding claims against and interests pursuant to Section 1121(a) of the Bankruptcy Code (as amended and supplemented, the “Plan”) and a related disclosure statement. The Bankruptcy Court entered an order on June 12, 2017 confirming the Plan (the “Confirmation Order”) solely with respect to the Company, which provided that the effective date of the Plan will occur when all conditions precedent to effectiveness, as set forth in the Plan, have been satisfied or waived.
Two of the conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan were (i) the closing of the HCS Acquisition of (as defined below) and (ii) the restructuring (the “Note Refinancing”) of the Company’s outstanding Series 1 Notes, Series 2 Notes and Series 3 Notes (collectively, the “2011 Notes”), held by Taberna Preferred Funding I, Ltd. (“Taberna I”), Taberna Preferred Funding II, Ltd. (“Taberna II”) and Kodiak CDO I, Ltd. (“Kodiak” and, together with Taberna I and Taberna II, the “Noteholders”), issued pursuant to three Indentures, each dated as of March 22, 2011, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon

Under the Plan, holders of existing equity interests in the Company (i.e., the common stock) retain their interests.
Additional details of the bankruptcy reorganization are discussed in Notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.

("ShoreTel"), pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 21, 2015, by and among the Company, Corvisa Services LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and ShoreTel (the "Corvisa Sale").

These costs are included in the caption general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
Note Refinancing
On July 27, 2017, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of the same date (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), with NHI and HCS as guarantors (together with the Company, collectively, the “Credit Parties”), the Noteholders and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as collateral agent for the benefit of the Noteholders, to refinance $85,937,500 of principal indebtedness of the Company under the 2011 Notes. Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Noteholders exchanged their 2011 Notes for new notes from the Company in the same aggregate principal amount (collectively, the “2017 Notes”) on the terms and conditions set forth therein. The unpaid principal amounts of the 2017 Notes bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 3.5% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears until maturity on March 30, 2033. The 2017 Notes generally rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future subordinated indebtedness of the Credit Parties. The Company may at any time upon 30 days’ notice to the Noteholders redeem all or part of the 2017 Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, in connection with the Note Refinancing, the Company paid all overdue and unpaid accrued interest on the 2011 Notes in the agreed, reduced aggregate amount of $5,775,779, and paid $500,000 in fees and expenses incurred by the Noteholders.
Additional details of the Note Purchase Agreement and the Note Refinancing are discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
Business
Our business includes the operation of HCS and the management of our other investments, as described below. 
HCS
Established in 1995, HCS is the largest outsourced healthcare services provider in the State of Georgia. HCS delivers outsourced full-time and part-time employees primarily to Community Service Boards (“CSBs”). A CSB is a quasi-state organization providing behavioral health services at facilities across Georgia including mental health services, developmental disabilities programs and substance abuse treatments. The State of Georgia has a total of 25 CSBs. Each CSB has a number of facilities, including crisis centers, outpatient centers and 24-hour group homes that require a broad range of employees, such as registered nurses, social workers, house parents and supervisors. The CSB market in Georgia is large and growing steadily, as the demand for the services provided by the CSBs continues to grow. The Georgia Association for CSBs estimates that CSBs in Georgia provided services to over 173,000 people in 2010, a figure that grew to over 188,000 people in 2015. In addition to providing outsourced employees to CSBs, HCS also provides healthcare outsourcing and staffing services to hospitals, schools and a variety of privately owned businesses.

Over the past 15 years, HCS has become the largest medical services outsource provider in Georgia, operating throughout the state. HCS has long-term relationships with its customers and has been providing services to several clients for more than 15 years. The services and positions provided to non-CSB clients are similar to the ones provided to CSB client.
Other Investments
Prior to 2015, the Company originated, purchased, securitized, sold, invested in and serviced residential nonconforming mortgage loans and mortgage securities. As a result of those activities, we acquired mortgage securities that continue to be a source of our earnings and cash flow. Residual securities consist of interest-only and overcollateralization bonds. Collectively, these securities are referred to as our retained mortgage securities.
Strategy
The strategy of HCS is to continue expanding its market share in providing healthcare staffing services in Georgia and in particular serving Georgia CSBs. HCS is the dominant player in providing services to Georgia CSBs and has earned a market share of 55% of the CSB business. HCS will also continue to expand business to additional hospitals, private group homes, clinics, rest homes, prisons and retirement centers. Furthermore, the HCS strategy includes expanding clerical staff within existing customers, as well as gaining new clients. The longer-term strategy includes expansion beyond the Georgia market and may include acquisitions of staffing companies outside of Georgia, particularly in states that have public health infrastructure similar to that of Georgia.
We expect to use profits from HCS along with, potentially, other funding sources to acquire other businesses or make investments.
Competition
HCS competes with numerous national staffing and recruiting businesses that specialize in the medical and healthcare industry, such as Nursefinders, Lighthouse Recruiting, Action Med and Brightstar. Other national staffing businesses have divisions that compete with HCS in Georgia, including Kelly Services, Interim, Randstad and Maxim. Numerous Georgia non-national and smaller staffing providers also compete with HCS.
Regulation
The healthcare industry is subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations related to, among
other things, conduct of operations, and costs and payment for services. HCS is not directly regulated as a healthcare provider,
although the customers of HCS are highly regulated. Therefore, HCS complies with many of the regulations prescribed for its
customers.
HCS provides services directly to its clients on a contract basis and receives payment directly from them. However, many clients are reimbursed under the federal Medicare program and state Medicaid programs for the services they provide.
Therefore, HCS also may be affected indirectly by reimbursement changes in government programs, particularly Medicare and
Medicaid.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, the Company employed 4 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. As of October 24, 2017, the Company employed 1,400 full-time employees and 569 part-time employees. None of the Company's employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
