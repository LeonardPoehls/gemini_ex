ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Explanatory Note
Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may refer to Intersections Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries as “we,” “us,” “our” and "the Company."
Overview
We provide innovative software and data monitoring and analytics solutions that help consumers manage financial and personal risks associated with the proliferation of their personal data in the virtual and financial world. Under our Identity Guard® brand and other brands that comprise our Personal Information Services segment, we have helped consumers monitor, manage and protect against the risks associated with their identities and personal information for more than twenty years. We offer identity theft and privacy protection as well as credit monitoring services for consumers to understand, monitor, manage and protect their personal information and privacy. Under our Identity Guard® and Identity Guard® with Watson™ products, we help protect consumers against the risks associated with the inappropriate exposure of their personal information that can result in fraudulent use or reputation damage. Identity Guard® is offered through large and small organizations as an embedded product for either its employees or consumers, as well as directly to consumers through our direct marketing efforts. In 2017, we expanded our suite of Identity Guard® and Identity Guard® with Watson™ products. Identity Guard® with Watson™ offers robust early detection of potential risks, stretching beyond credit-centric risks to include online privacy risks, and provides personalized threat alerts with actionable steps to help keep our customers’ information private from the earliest stage possible. We believe that our suite of products and services offer consumers the most proactive and comprehensive identity theft monitoring and online privacy services available on the market today.
We have ongoing operations in one other segment, Insurance and Other Consumer Services. As part of our strategy to have a singular focus on our Personal Information Services segment, we recently sold: 1) the business comprising our Bail Bonds Industry Solutions segment in January 2017; 2) our Habits at Work business, the results of which are recorded in our Personal Information Services segment, in June 2017; and 3) the business comprising our Pet Health Monitoring segment in July 2017. For additional information, please see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Corporate headquarter office transactions including, but not limited to, payroll, share based compensation and other expenses related to our Chairman and non-employee Board of Directors are reported in our Corporate business unit.
During 2017, we refinanced our existing senior secured indebtedness with Crystal Financial SPV LLC ("Prior Credit Agreement") with a new term loan facility with PEAK6 Investments, L.P. ("PEAK6 Investments"). We also executed amendments to the new term loan facility (together with the amendments, the "New Credit Agreement"), which had a principal outstanding amount of $21.5 million as of December 31, 2017. In connection with the New Credit Agreement, we paid PEAK6 Investments $1.5 million for the repurchase of common stock, and we received a total of $2.2 million for the issuance of a warrant to purchase 1.5 million shares of our common stock. The proceeds were, and will be, used for general corporate purposes, including investments in internal business development resources, internal technology systems and platforms, and continuous innovation of our products. For additional information, please see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.

Our Primary Business
We offer identity and privacy protection services to consumers through our Personal Information Services segment. This segment constituted approximately 96% and 93% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We typically offer our services on a monthly or annual subscription basis. Our subscriber counts as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 1.1 million and 1.2 million, respectively.

Products and Services
Our Personal Information Services segment includes privacy, personal information security and identity theft monitoring and remediation services to help consumers understand, monitor, manage and protect against the risks associated with the inappropriate and sometimes criminal exposure of their personal information. Our current services include: providing credit reports, performing credit monitoring and providing educational credit scores and credit education; reports, monitoring and education about other personal information and risks, such as public records, identity validation, new account opening, social media footprint and Internet data risks; identity theft recovery services; identity theft cost reimbursement insurance of up to $1.0 million underwritten by a prominent insurance company; and software and other technology tools and services. Our resolution team applies its expertise to assist consumers with the remediation of confirmed identity theft events by providing pertinent documentation, communicating directly with creditors and placing fraud alerts on their behalf. We also offer breach response services to large and small organizations responding to compromises of sensitive personal information and other customer and employee data, mitigating potential damage to the customers and the corporate brand. We help these organizations notify the affected individuals and we provide the affected individuals with identity theft recovery and credit monitoring services. We continue to develop innovative new services and tools to add to our Identity Guard® portfolio and address the increasing awareness by consumers of the risks associated with their personal information.
We believe the threat to consumers’ personal information goes beyond traditional credit monitoring. The proliferation of data breaches, the pervasive use of social media and the increased sophistication of cyber criminals requires a solution for consumers’ needs in the identity protection space. To effectively identify, manage and remediate these new threats to consumers, we focused on expanding Identity Guard® with Watson™ in 2017. Identity Guard® with Watson™ is an identity theft monitoring and privacy advisory solution that can be personalized to each individual’s specific needs and is designed to protect the entire family. Identity Guard® with Watson™ maximizes the power of IBM Watson™ cognitive computing to offer consumers the traditional credit monitoring services as well as non-credit related preventative alert services, using previously unmonitored unstructured data sources and processes and safe web browsing tools. Identity Guard® with Watson™ also equips users to reduce their risk of identity theft by educating individuals on existing risks to their personal information and recommending personalized remediation actions. Identity Guard® with Watson™ also offers social insights that help consumers and their families understand and responsibly manage their social media presence, including assistance to strengthen a consumer’s online privacy settings and remediation of potentially damaging posts. We believe it is the first product of its kind that uses natural language processing and machine learning to reveal insights from large amounts of unstructured data, delivered through the IBM Watson™ technology platform. This platform is more scalable and adaptable than our legacy platform, which we believe will enable us to develop innovative new products and features for consumers and organizations more readily than in the past. As we focus on making Identity Guard® with Watson™ our leading offering to consumers and their families in the U.S. and Canada, we significantly invested in our product and business development group in 2017 and plan to continue this investment in 2018, as the pipeline of engagement leads grow and we continue to seek to convert the market opportunities into sustainable revenue.
Marketing and Distribution
We have a dual go-to-market strategy in the U.S. and Canada, through partner marketing and through direct-to-consumer marketing via search and display messaging. A substantial number of subscriptions in our products and services are canceled each year, as we believe is the case for similar products offered by our competitors in the identity theft monitoring industry. There is an investment cost to acquire a new subscriber and produce initial fulfillment materials, and therefore subscribers typically must be retained for a number of months in order to cover these costs. Our goal is to achieve a customer retention profile sufficient to achieve positive cash flow returns on these investment costs, above predetermined hurdle rates, across our entire subscription population.
In 2016 and 2017, we continued to expand our business relationships with new partners including retail, communication and other industrial partners, as well as partnering with employers to offer Identity Guard® as an employee benefit option. Building off our historically successful partner product distribution strategy, we have increased our internal business development capability in various channels more than 100% as we continue to pursue and contract with partners to bring our suite of differentiated and comprehensive products to their customers. We also made significant investments in our internal systems, member platforms and IT security compliance in order to build, enhance and prioritize security in our partner distribution channels and generate subscriber growth using an agile development process. We continue to develop, improve and expand upon all of these important initiatives.
We derive the majority of our revenue from historical agreements with U.S. financial institutions, which constituted approximately 55% and 59% of our Personal Information Services segment revenue in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Revenue from our largest client, Bank of America, constituted approximately 44% and 48% of our Personal Information Services segment revenue in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Bank of America ceased marketing of our services to new customers in 2011. Under our agreements with Bank of America, we continue to provide our services to the subscribers we acquired through Bank of America before December 31, 2011, subject to normal attrition and other ongoing adjustments by us or Bank of America, which may result in cancellation of certain subscribers or groups of subscribers. Bank of America, however, has the right to require us to cease providing services to its customers under existing subscriptions if the contract is terminated due to material breach by us or based on various events such as certain legal or regulatory changes, a party’s bankruptcy or insolvency, or other events. Furthermore, we are dependent on Bank of America to cooperate in continued servicing, including subscriber billing. We did not generate any new subscribers from Bank of America or other U.S. financial institution clients in 2017 or 
4

2016, as all marketing of our products by our financial institution clients in the U.S. was terminated in both our Personal Information Services and Insurance and Other Consumer Services segments.
Sources of Supply
Our major source of data used in providing our services to consumers resulted from our continuing agreements with Equifax, Experian and TransUnion in both the U.S. and Canada. We believe we are an important customer to each of the three bureaus. The contract with Equifax expires in 2021. The Experian and TransUnion contracts may be terminated by them on 30 days’ and 60 days’ notice, respectively. Each of the credit reporting agencies also competes with us in providing credit scores, credit reports and limited credit monitoring services to subscribers.
In 2017, we renegotiated volume pricing, as well as any minimum fixed fees, of the supply of credit bureau data for our product features while also exploring alternative data sources. We have entered into long-term contracts with several other providers of data and analytics for our new Identity Guard® with Watson™ product, including new data sources, advanced tools and analytical capabilities, and more timely notification of activities and more useable content. In certain contractual arrangements, we pay non-refundable license fees in exchange for the limited exclusive rights to use the data. We routinely review the effectiveness and cost of these exclusivity agreements in conjunction with our projected data usage and business forecasts and may make adjustments to our data mix and providers.
Industry Overview and Competition
Identity fraud has been the most reported consumer complaint in the U.S. for the past 15 years, according to the Federal Trade Commission. According to Javelin Strategy & Research, identity fraud continued its sharp upward trend in 2017, as the number of victims in the U.S. alone rose to 16.7 million, 8% higher than 2016 and 27% higher than 2015. Account takeover and card-not-present fraud were the primary drivers of the significant increase. The estimated cost of identity fraud in the U.S. in 2017 was nearly $17 billion, up from $16 billion in 2016. The increased use of e-commerce (including the use of mobile applications), social media and the Internet, as well as the amount of reported breaches of consumer data by large retailers, healthcare providers and other organizations has compounded the amount of identity theft and identity fraud events. As a result, the markets for our Personal Information Services segment are quite robust and growing continually. We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment. We believe that the competitive factors in our market include access to a breadth of identity and consumer transaction data, broad and effective service offerings, brand recognition, technology, effective and cost-efficient customer acquisition, customer satisfaction, price, quality and reliable customer service, and accurate identification of appropriate target markets for our business. Our principal competitors include the following companies and their subsidiaries or affiliates: Equifax; Experian; TransUnion; LifeLock; AllClear ID; and Davis & Henderson in Canada. We compete with these companies to provide our services to our distribution partners’ customers and our own direct subscribers. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do, which may allow them to devote greater resources to developing, promoting and selling services, offer services at lower prices than we do and develop and launch new products and services more quickly or effectively than we do. In addition, competitor distribution to and retention of new subscribers may benefit from greater brand recognition and brand loyalty than we have or may be able to achieve.
Other
 Our Insurance and Other Consumer Services segment includes insurance and membership products for consumers, delivered on a subscription basis. We are not planning to develop new business in this segment and are experiencing normal subscriber attrition due to ceased marketing and retention efforts. Some of our legacy subscriber portfolios have been cancelled, and our continued servicing of other subscribers may be cancelled as a result of actions taken by one or more financial institutions.
Prior to July 31, 2017, our Pet Health Monitoring segment included the health and wellness monitoring products and services for veterinarians and pet owners through our former subsidiary, i4c Innovations LLC ("i4c" or "Voyce"). Voyce generated substantial losses from formation to 2016 and, after concentrated efforts, was unable to generate an acceptable level of revenue. Effective July 31, 2017, we sold Voyce to a newly-formed entity of which Michael R. Stanfield, our Executive Chairman and President, is a minority investor. The results of this segment are reported as discontinued operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. For additional information, please see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. 
Prior to January 31, 2017, our Bail Bonds Industry Solutions segment included the automated service solutions for the bail bonds industry provided by Captira Analytical LLC ("Captira"). Effective January 31, 2017, we divested our ownership in Captira. This segment’s operating results, along with the operating results of Habits at Work, have not had a major effect on our consolidated financial results and are not classified as a discontinued operation. For additional information, please see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.

Government Regulation
We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA"), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and comparable state laws that are patterned after the FTC Act, and other similar laws, rules and regulations. We also are subject to federal and state laws and regulations relating to the channels in which we sell and market our services, as well as a consent order with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as described below. We incur significant costs to operate our business and monitor our compliance with these laws, regulations, and consent decrees. Any changes to the existing applicable laws or regulations, or any determination that other laws or regulations are applicable to us, could increase our costs or impede our ability to provide our services to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects. In addition, any of these laws or regulations may be subject to revision, and we cannot predict the impact of such changes on our business. Further, any determination that we have violated any of these laws, regulations, or consent decrees may result in liability for fines, damages, or other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects.
Laws Governing Consumer Marketing, Product Distribution and Administration
Marketing, distribution and ongoing administration of our consumer products and services are subject to various federal and state laws, depending on the circumstances, including the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act, Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, CAN-SPAM Act, Electronic Fund Transfer Act, U.S. Card Act, and both federal and state laws prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive practices or requiring disclosure of information about various products and services. Similar laws and regulations govern our business in Canada, and include federal and provincial laws.
Other state or federal laws may apply, depending on the nature of the products and services or marketing channel or method. For example, the insurance products we sell are subject to state insurance laws, including license requirements and oversight and other restrictions and requirements regarding the sale and administration of insurance and some of our products are governed by state laws governing discount medical plans or other programs.
Privacy and Information
Consumer marketing and products generally are governed by federal and state laws regarding the use, sharing and protection of personal information. Specific state or federal laws may apply depending on the nature of the products and services or marketing channel or method. For example, we are subject to the federal FCRA and similar state laws governing credit information, as well as to state and federal privacy laws governing financial institutions or products, including the federal Gramm Leach Bliley Act and certain state laws governing the sharing or use of personal information by financial institutions and their affiliates.
Privacy laws and regulations that may apply to our business in Canada include the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and federal and provincial laws and regulations regarding credit report information.
With the growing public concern regarding privacy and the collection, distribution, and use of consumer personal information, we believe we are in an environment in which there is an increased regulatory scrutiny concerning data collection and use practices and the provision and marketing of services, like ours, that seek to protect that information. We expect that kind of scrutiny to continue as the marketplace for services like ours continues to develop.
Laws Governing Financial Products and Institutions
Our financial institution clients are subject to federal laws and regulations that govern financial institutions and their affiliates, financial products, financial information privacy, financial accounts such as credit cards, debit cards, demand deposit accounts and mortgages, and payment systems and processes. Our financial institution clients are subject to oversight by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, CFPB and other federal or state regulatory agencies. In part based on the requirements of those regulatory agencies, our financial institution clients are required to exercise oversight of us, and often require us by contract to comply with certain of the laws and regulations that apply directly to them.
Federal and state agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the CFPB, state attorneys general and other state regulatory agencies, including state insurance regulators, continue to review and monitor the consumer finance and other industries for unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices and take enforcement actions. These agencies may, at times, pursue administrative proceedings or litigation to enforce the laws and regulations subject to its jurisdiction. In the proceedings, the agencies can obtain cease and desist orders, which include orders for restitution to consumers or rescission of contracts, as well as other types of relief, including, under certain circumstances, substantial monetary penalties.
In 2015, we entered into a consent order with the CFPB in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, we agreed to implement a satisfactory compliance plan to comply with the Order and to provide a progress update. We also submitted an amended compliance plan to the CFPB in early 2017.

Other Laws and Regulations
Other laws and regulations may apply to one or more of our business segments generally or specifically based on the activities of that segment. For example, state insurance laws and laws governing discount medical programs or other discount programs apply to certain of the products in our Insurance and Other Consumer Services segment.
Intellectual Property
We consider certain of our processes, systems, methodologies, databases, tangible and intangible materials, software and trademarks to be proprietary. We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright, trademark and other laws, license agreements and non-disclosure, non-competition and other contractual provisions, and technical measures, to protect our proprietary and intellectual property rights. Certain features and functions of our products and services use intellectual property under license from third parties, which we at times sub-license to our clients and others. We may depend on certain of those licenses to operate parts of our products. When we market our services in client-branded programs, we rely on licenses from our clients to use their trademarks.
We depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our management, as well as that of our other employees, advisors, consultants and contractors, none of which are patentable. To help protect our know-how, and any inventions for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality and inventions agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
Cybersecurity
Recently, there has been an increase in the number of major consumer data breaches, including a breach of one of the largest consumer reporting agencies. We continue to review those incidents for insights into how we can reduce our risk of a breach and incorporate those observations into our continuous monitoring of our cybersecurity controls, which we believe meet or exceed industry best practices. In addition, we believe the recent breaches have not had an adverse effect on our business, subscriber base, or vendor relationships; however, there can be no assurances that they will not have an adverse effect in the future. We will continue to evaluate our business and the financial or other impact, if any, of the consumer reporting agency breach and the response of that organization.
We have adopted data security policies, data breach mitigation policies and data breach response policies and procedures, which we regularly review and update. Our data breach response policies and procedures delineate the actions that we will implement in the event that we discover or have reason to believe that a data breach has occurred, including but not limited to convening our Data Breach Response Team, terminating the breach, initiating an investigation, preserving relevant evidence, escalating and disseminating information and action plans throughout our organization, promptly identifying and notifying affected individuals, contacting regulators and law enforcement as appropriate and mitigating damage or loss incurred by affected individuals and the Company. 
The Risk Management Committee of our Board of directors meets regularly with the members of management who lead our cyber and information security efforts. During those meetings, the Committee receives detailed reports and presentations regarding our cyber and information security, data breach risk mitigation and data breach response programs, engages with the responsible executives and reports any comments or concerns to management and the full Board. 
Our Insider Trading Policy prohibits our employees from purchasing or selling our stock or other securities based upon material, non-public information, including but not limited to a data or information security breach. Employees must obtain from our Chief Legal Officer written pre-clearance for any such purchase or sale, which the Chief Legal Officer will not issue in the event of a known material data or information security breach, the existence of which has not been made public.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 362 employees, compared to 422 employees as of December 31, 2016. Our future performance depends significantly on the continued service of our key personnel. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements. We believe our employee relations are good.
