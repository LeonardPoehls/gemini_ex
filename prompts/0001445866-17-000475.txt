ITEM 1. Description of Business
Overview
 



Leo Motors, Inc. (the "Company") is a Nevada Corporation incorporated on September 8, 2004.  The Company established a wholly-owned operating subsidiary in Korea named Leo Motors Co. Ltd. ("Leozone") on July 1, 2006.  Through Leozone, the Company is engaged in the research and development ("R&D") of multiple products, prototypes, and conceptualizations based on proprietary, patented and patent pending electric power generation, drive train and storage technologies.  Leozone operates through four unincorporated divisions: new product research & development ("R&D"), post R&D development such as product testing, production, and sales.
 
The Company's products include (i) E-Box electric energy storage system for solar and wind power generation devices; and (ii) EV components that integrate electric batteries with electric motors such as EV Controllers that use a mini-computer to control torque drive.
 
The Company was previously actively engaged in the process of development and production of Electric Power Train Systems ("EPTS") encompassing electric scooters, electric sedans/SUVs/sports cars, and electric buses/trucks as well as several models of Electric Vehicle ("EV"). Our EPTS can replace internal combustion engines ("ICEs"). Company began sales of EPTS to auto makers and agricultural machinery manufacturers.
 
The Company has developed eight EPTS of increasing power rating: 3kW, 5kW, 7.5kW, 15kW, 30kW, 60kW, 120kW, and 240kW systems. Each EPTS consists of a motor, a controller, and a battery power pack with a battery management system ("BMS").
 
The Company has successfully converted existing models of small cars (ICEs under 2,000cc), and also a 24 seat bus. The Company has begun marketing its 60kW power train kits (for compact passenger cars and small trucks) and its 120kW kits (for ICE passenger cars, buses, and trucks under 5,000cc). The Company has developed a 240kW kit (for up to 10,000cc buses and trucks) as well, and is attempting to locate a strategic partner to fund the testing and production. 
 
The specific goals of the Company over the next twelve months include:
 

· Focus on the capitalization of the Company; 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· Focus on the sale of the E-Boats, connected EV’s, intelligent poles, and smart parking tower system and E-Box; 
· Business development in China and in America by establishing a joint venture companies; 
· Continue with R&D of our EV's, E-Boats, connected car, products for smart cities and related products as capital permits.

 
The E-Box can be used as an energy supplying device in an emergency situations or as a energy storage device for use by the military; municipal and industry; corporate; solar/wind power storage; electric coolers and heaters; yachts or small ships. The E-Box is offered in three power classes: 1kw, 3kw and 5kw.  E-Boxes for 10kw and 550kw will be developed in the future.  The E-Box is environmentally friendly with high energy density due to the use of lithium-polymer battery.  The E-Box uses a multiple cell voltage balancing system via a battery management system ("BMS").
 
The Company is developing new battery exchange system using its patented cartridge battery exchange system which will solve the cost barriers of the electric vehicle to make them less expensive than their Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) counterparts and to help solve battery charging problems. With evolutionary batter exchange system, the Company's EV's can exchange battery within one minute using simple and low cost equipment. This technology can be best used in fleet managed vehicles such as city buses, taxis, and garbage trucks because it can be used any road sides. The Company is developing EV Ecosystem using connected car solution to provide the battery swap services for fleet operators such as rental cars, public companies, delivery companies, and post offices.

The Company acquired Leo AIC (former name was Lelcon) on June 3, 2016. With the acquisition, the Company was engaged in connected car and artificial intelligence (AI) related businesses for smart city. Leo AIC has developed tele-diagnosing and tele-operation system for cars and things such as smart street lights and intelligent parking tower system. Leo AIC has been selling these systems and products to several cities in China and in Korea. Solutions from Leo AIC will be provided to EV’s and E-Boats provided by the Company, thus, all vehicles are connected to the cloud server and AI, thus they provide organized battery swap services as well as better riding experiences.
 
The Company acquired Leo Members which integrates Leo Factory 1 and 2, and Leo Trade. Leo Members will start used luxury car trading business through affiliation with car repairing garages (car centers) in Korea. Leo Members is developing used car recommendation solution including car history tracking using AIC’s vehicle diagnosing manager, financing through fintech financing services provided by its affiliated financial company, and connected repairing services.

Corporate History
 
Leo Motors, Inc. (the "Company") was originally incorporated as Classic Auto Accessories of North America, a California Corporation on July 2, 1986. The Company then underwent several name changes from FCR Automotive Group, Inc. to Shini Precision Machinery, Inc. to Simco America Inc. and then to Leo Motors. The Company had been dormant since 1989, and effectuated a reverse merger on November 12, 2007 with Leozone Inc., a South Korean Company, which is the maker of electrical transportation devices. The merger essentially exchanges shares in Leo Motors, Inc. for shares in Leozone. As this is a reverse merger the accounting treatment of such is that of a combination of the two entities with the activity of Leozone, Inc. the surviving entity, going forward. The financial statements reflect the activity for all periods presented as if the merger had occurred January 1, 2007. Leozone has continued to operate as a separate subsidiary (Leo Motors Co. Ltd. of Korea) since that time.
 
On February 11, 2010, the Company acquired 50% of Leo B&T Corp., ("B&T") a Korean Corporation, from two shareholders of B&T in exchange for 7,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock. This percentage was reduced to 30% in 2011. Additionally, this investment was written down through an impairment expense during 2011 and the remaining investment was exchanged in 2012 for a return of Leo Motors stock.

 • Successful deploy of an EV ecosystem in Korea;
 • Sales of intelligent poles and smart parking systems in China by establishing a joint venture company; and
 • Continue with R&D of our EV's, electric boats, AI connected products, smart car trading system, and related products as capital permits.
 
There can be no assurance that the Company will adhere to any of the above goals.
 
Marketing

The Company tries to set up Chinese companies to market intelligent poles and smart parking systems to the cities in China. The newly set up Chinese companies are to be joint ventures introduced by city governments in China. 
 
The Company will go to trade shows in China to market digital clusters which integrated vehicle diagnosis, information and entertainment, navigation, and intelligent systems into one vehicle cockpit. The target markets are small and medium Chinese auto makers which do not have technology and capabilities to develop such clusters.
 
The Company will relaunch the ESS with Intelligent ESS (IESS) micro grid system which gets rid of redundant components in the system. Incorporated with network safety through mesh network using block chain, the traffic in Company’s Micro Grid is directly made without going through the central server in the cloud. In this way, the Company will minimize maintenance costs while maximizing grid management efficiency and system security. 
 
The Company will enter into the U.S. market this year by providing electric conversion services. The Company will replace old internal combustion engine yachts and powerboats to the electric power system. The Company is communicating with potential partners in America for its conversion enterprise
 
The Company has marketed electric fishing boats with 120 kW power trains. The 120W power train boat was registered to the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives as first marketed electric boat product in Korea. With the registration, our customers of e-Fishing Boats can receive government subsidy when they purchase the 120kW power train boat from us.
