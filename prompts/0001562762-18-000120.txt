     ITEM 1. BUSINESS
     Introduction
     We are a leader in the manufacture of microdisplays using organic light emitting diode (OLED) technology. We design, develop, manufacture and market OLED miniature displays, which we refer to as OLED‑on‑silicon microdisplays, virtual imaging products that utilize OLED microdisplays, and related products. We also perform research in the OLED field. Our virtual imaging products integrate OLED technology with silicon chips to produce high‑resolution microdisplays which, when viewed through a magnifying headset, create virtual images that appear comparable in size to that of a computer monitor or a large‑screen television. Our products enable our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers to develop and market improved or new electronic products, especially products that are mobile and highly portable so that people have immediate access to information and can experience immersive forms of communications and entertainment. We believe that a key growth area for us is the consumer electronic OEM market. Our potential channels to this market include licensing our direct patterning technology and partnering for the mass production of microdisplays. We believe that our direct patterning (dPd) technology is a key differentiator for enabling next generation augmented reality/virtual reality AR/VR hardware for the consumer and enterprise segments because of the brightness and the pixel density afforded by the technology. We also develop and manufacture night vision products for the consumer electronics, recreational, law enforcement and first responder markets, including a smart phone attachment and a wearable device.
 We believe that our OLED microdisplays offer a number of significant advantages over comparable liquid crystal microdisplays, including higher contrast, greater power efficiency, less weight, more compact size, and negligible image smearing. Using our active matrix OLED technology, many computer and electronic system functions can be built directly into the OLED microdisplay silicon backplane, resulting in compact, high resolution and power efficient systems. Already proven in military and commercial systems, our product portfolio of OLED microdisplays deliver high‑resolution, flicker‑free virtual images that perform effectively even in extreme temperatures and high‑vibration conditions. We also believe that our direct patterning technology gives us a substantial advantage over other OLED microdisplays because it allows us to produce microdisplays with the high brightness required for VR and AR. Traditional OLED microdisplays utilize white emitting OLED with color filters that lessen the intensity of emitted light by as much as 85%, significantly reducing brightness. Microdisplays manufactured by direct patterning do not require color filters to achieve color variations and allow for the application of more efficient OLED structures which achieve high brightness.
 We have developed our own intellectual property portfolio that includes 34 U.S. patents and 28 U.S.  patent applications, over 15 years of manufacturing know‑how and proprietary technologies to create high performance OLED microdisplays. We believe our technology, intellectual property portfolio and position in the marketplace give us a leadership position in OLED and OLED‑on‑silicon microdisplay technology. We believe that we are one of only a few companies to market and produce significant quantities of high resolution, small molecule OLED‑on‑silicon microdisplays.
 We derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our OLED microdisplay products. We also earn revenue from commercial and consumer product and government development contracts that may complement and support our internal research and development programs. In addition, we generate sales from optics and microdisplays combined with optics. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we introduced two consumer night vision products, BlazeSpark and BlazeTorch, although revenue from these products to date has been minimal as ongoing development of these products continues.
 We were formed through the merger of Fashion Dynamics Corporation, which was organized on January 23, 1996 under the laws of the State of Nevada, and FED Corporation, a developer and manufacturer of optical systems and microdisplays for use in the electronics industry. Simultaneous with this merger, we changed our name to eMagin Corporation. We are incorporated in the state of Delaware.

 Our Industry
 A microdisplay generally has a screen size that is less than two inches in diagonal. The miniature size enables them to be used in a wide variety of applications that require a screen that takes up small space, such as head‑mounted displays (HMDs) and viewfinders of digital cameras. Microdisplays are used across various industries including consumer electronics, enterprise/industrial, military, defense, aerospace, and healthcare. Microdisplays provide many advantages over other displays where small size is a requirement. Benefits include compact size, high brightness and resolution, low power consumption, and high contrast. Devices incorporating microdisplays include HMDs, smart glasses and headset products. Sales of AR and VR gear, which include HMD, smart glasses and headsets, are estimated to exceed $26 billion by 2021, according to Technavio.

Display quality is widely accepted as a key performance driver for ensuring the optimal user experience. We believe that this requirement for better display quality will result in next generation products in consumer electronics, defense, aviation, medical and industrial/enterprise segments of the market which utilize microdisplays.
 Our Technology Platforms
 Small Molecule, Top‑Emitting Active Matrix OLED Technology
 Our microdisplays are currently based upon active matrix small molecule OLED technology, which we refer to as active matrix OLED (AMOLED). Our AMOLED technology uniquely permits millions of individual low‑voltage light sources to be built on low‑cost, silicon computer chips to produce single color, white or full‑color display arrays. Using our OLED technology, many computer and video electronic system functions can be built directly into the silicon chip, under the OLED film, resulting in a compact, integrated system with lower overall system costs relative to alternative technologies.
 OLEDs are thin films of stable organic materials that emit light of various colors when a voltage is impressed across them. OLEDs are emissive devices, which means that they create their own light, as opposed to liquid crystal displays, which require a separate light source. As a result, our OLED microdisplays use less power and deliver much higher contrast and fuller color than liquid crystal microdisplays. Unlike liquid crystal displays which use crossed polarizers to generate black level, OLED displays exhibit an extremely high contrast ratio which results in very vivid images. Because the light they emit is Lambertian, which means that it appears equally bright from most forward directions, a moderate movement in the eye does not change the image brightness or color as it does in other technologies.
 Our technology is based on integrating a proprietary OLED device with a specially designed silicon backplane to produce efficient and high performance AMOLED microdisplays. Our OLED displays incorporate a proprietary, top‑emitting structure for our OLED devices that enables OLED displays to be built on opaque silicon integrated circuits rather than only on glass. Our OLED microdisplays emit full visible spectrum (white) light that is isolated with color filters to create color images. Our microdisplays have a brightness that can be greater than that of a typical notebook computer and can have a potential useful life of over 50,000 operating hours in certain applications. New processes and device improvements, such as our OLED‑XLS technology, offer even better expected performance for brightness, efficiency, and lifespan. We have developed extremely bright OLED microdisplays using our patented dPd technology and have demonstrated color high resolution 2K x 2K and WUXGA microdisplays with brightness in excess of 5,000 nits, which we believe is the world’s highest resolution and brightness. In addition to our AMOLED technology, we have developed compact optic and lens enhancements, which when coupled with the microdisplay, provide the high quality large screen appearance that we believe a large proportion of the marketplace demands.
 We believe that our AMOLED technology provides significant advantages over other microdisplay technologies in our targeted markets. We believe these key advantages include:

· | High brightness
--+----------------


· | Sharp contrast
--+---------------


· | Low power consumption for improved battery life and longer system life;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | High‑speed performance resulting in clear video images;

--+--------------------------------------


· | Wide angle light emission resulting in large apparent screen size and more immersive experience;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Wide operating temperature range;
--+----------------------------------


· | Good environmental stability (vibration and humidity); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | Anticipated low manufacturing cost at higher volumes.
--+------------------------------------------------------

  Prism Optics
 We sell high quality, large viewing angle prism optics with a wide range for eye positioning, both of which are essential for using our displays in immersive near‑eye systems. We have developed advanced molded plastic prism lenses that permit our AMOLED microdisplays to provide -realistic images that can be viewed for extended periods with reduced eye‑fatigue. We have developed an additional prism optic for a project that will pair with our SXGA096 display.

Our Market Opportunities
 We target the military, aviation, industrial/medical, and consumer markets although many of our products cater to multiple markets. Within each of these market sectors we believe that our OLED microdisplays, when combined with compact optic lenses, can become a key component for a variety of mobile electronic products. Many of these products employ head‑wearable displays that incorporate microdisplays mounted in or on eyeglasses, goggles, simple headbands, helmets, or hardhats, and are often referred to as HMDs or headsets. Head‑wearable displays may block out visual surroundings for a fully immersive experience, or be designed to “see‑through” or “see‑around” to the user’s surroundings. They may contain one (monocular) or two (binocular) displays. We have leveraged our experience developing military and commercial aviation helmets and believe this experience will allow us to more rapidly introduce displays suitable for specialized/high‑end mass market consumer AR/VR applications than our competitors. Consumer
 We believe that the most significant driver of the longer term near‑eye virtual imaging microdisplay market is the growing consumer demand for mobile access to larger volumes of information and entertainment in smaller and more affordable packages. This desire for mobility has resulted in the development of mobile video personal viewer products in three general categories: (1) immersive VR headset‑application platforms such as accessories for gaming computers, portable digital optical disc (DVD) systems and wearable telepresence systems; (2) AR electronic viewers incorporated in products such as data glasses and personal viewers for cell phones; and (3) low cost thermal and low light imaging and scopes for hunting and other outdoor activities.
 When we are able to manufacture our OLED displays in higher volumes at reduced costs and capitalize on our direct patterning technology, we believe that our products will be increasingly well positioned to compete with and displace liquid crystal displays and cell phone size displays in the rapidly growing consumer market, particularly as demand expands for sophisticated mobile personal viewers offering higher resolution and better image quality for VR and AR applications. Users of VR HMD’s are demanding a fully immersive experience. We believe our direct patterning technology addresses the critical performance parameters for next generation VR HMDs, including higher brightness, sharper resolution, lower power consumption, elimination of motion artifacts and longer life. Our strategy for addressing the consumer mass market includes developing partnerships with both Tier One consumer companies and high volume production manufacturing companies.
 Potential applications for these personal viewers include handheld personal computers and mobile devices, such as smartphones, whose small, direct view screens limit the amount of information that can be displayed but which are now capable of running more complex software applications. Examples encompass applications where hands‑free viewing is desired such as entertainment and gaming video headset systems; night time or thermal imaging devices for hunting, camping, and other outdoor activities; and maintenance applications. In addition, in late 2015, we entered into a HMD technology licensing agreement with a Tier One consumer electronics company which includes the use of our 2K × 2K displays in its consumer headsets. In first quarter 2017, we entered into an agreement with a Tier One company interested in incorporating our proprietary direct patterning technology into potential headset products.  Also during first quarter 2017, we performed tests for a Tier One consumer electronics company demonstrating our dPd technology as a path for AR and VR. We also entered into agreements with Tier One companies to develop a new display design for Virtual Reality and scale our dPd technology. In the first quarter 2017, we introduced two night vision products, BlazeSpark and BlazeTorch. These products are designed for recreational use as well as hobbyists, and outdoor enthusiasts. Additionally, the products can be used by utilities and law enforcement agencies to expand or enhance their night‑time activities.
 Military/Aviation
 We believe that head‑mounted systems incorporating our microdisplays increase the user’s effectiveness by allowing hands‑free operation and increasing situational awareness with sufficient brightness for use in daylight, yet controllable for nighttime light security. As a COTS (commercial off‑the‑shelf) component, OLED microdisplays possess performance characteristics important to military and other demanding commercial and industrial applications, including high contrast, wide dimming range, shock and vibration resistance and insensitivity to high G‑forces. The design features and performance characteristics of our OLED microdisplays reduce the size, weight, and power required by current and future military systems, while also providing a wide operating temperature range. The image does not suffer from flicker or color breakup in vibrating environments and the microdisplay’s wide viewing angle allows ease of viewing for long periods of time. Most importantly, our OLED’s low power consumption reduces battery weight and, for military applications, reduces constraints on mission length due to battery life. The OLED’s wide operating temperature range is of special interest for military applications because the display can turn on instantly at temperatures far below freezing and can operate at very high temperatures such as in desert conditions. We believe that our microdisplay products provide power advantages over other microdisplay technologies, particularly liquid crystal displays which require backlights and heaters and cannot provide instant‑on capabilities at low temperatures. Incorporating OLED microdisplays into aviation helmets has been made possible in part by the high brightness and other performance features of the OLED technology that we have developed.


 
6   

Our products’ military applications primarily fall into three broad areas: (1) helmet‑mounted and handheld displays for situational awareness and data; (2) night vision/thermal imaging goggles, rifles and targeting sights, and handheld viewers; and (3) training and simulation devices. These systems are also well suited for demanding operations such as urban security, homeland defense, and fire and rescue.
 Situational Awareness.  Our OLED microdisplays have been incorporated into a broad range of U.S. and foreign military situational awareness programs. Situational awareness products include head‑mounted displays that are used to display images, including digital map, sensor imagery and pilot aviation information. In addition, handheld imagers provide improved situational awareness on the battlefield, as well as in training and simulation. These products can also be combined with a weapon system to give the user the capability to select targets without direct exposure.
 Night Vision/Thermal Imaging.  Night vision goggles allow the user to see in low light conditions. Most versions include two different technologies: infrared/thermal and image intensification. Third and fourth generation military devices generally use some combination of the two technologies. Thermal imagers detect infrared energy (heat) and convert it into an electronic signal. The resulting signal needs to be presented on a display. Heat sensed by an infrared camera can be very precisely quantified, or measured, allowing the user to not only monitor thermal performance, but also identify and evaluate the relative severity of heat‑related problems. Thermal imaging systems can be stand‑alone handheld systems or integrated as part of the aiming mechanism for a larger system. Advances in sensor technology, both in sensitivity and resolution as well as economic efficiency, have been the driving factors in the adoption of thermal technologies for military applications. We believe the power efficiency and environmental ruggedness of our products are strong competitive advantages, particularly for smaller handheld non‑cooled systems. Fielded products incorporating our OLED microdisplays include Harris’ and L3 Insight’s Enhanced Night Vision Goggle II, the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle III, Family of Weapons Sights—Individual and Crew Served for the U.S. Army, L‑3’s Javelin medium‑range anti‑tank missile system, Northrop Grumman’s Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinders, Thales’ SOPHIE™ handheld thermal imagers, and Thales’ MINIE™, LUCIE™, and MONIE™ night vision goggles.
 Training and Simulation.  Our OLED microdisplays are purchased by OEMs for use with their simulation and training products. The companies that incorporate our OLEDs into their training and simulation applications include Quantum 3D, Rockwell Collins, Intevac Vision Systems, and Sensics, among others. Our displays have been commercialized and prototyped for situational awareness and night vision/thermal imaging applications by military systems integrators, including Elbit, L‑3 Communications, Intevac Vision Systems, Nivisys, BAE Systems Technology, DRS, Harris (formerly Excelis/ITT), Intevac Vision Systems, Qioptiq, Rockwell Collins, SA Photonics, Saab, Sagem DS, and Thales, among others.
 Commercial, Industrial, and Medical
 We believe that a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets offer significant opportunities for our products due to increasing demand for instant data accessibility in mobile workplace environments and due to the benefit of mobile displays to enhance visual performance. Examples of existing and potential microdisplay applications include enhanced visualization for ocular surgery, mobile ultrasound, mobile nondestructive testing, enhanced vision for those with visual impairments, immediate access to inventory or maintenance and construction manuals, routine quality assurance inspection, and real‑time viewing of images and data for a variety of applications. As an example, a user wearing an HMD while operating test equipment, such as an oscilloscope, can view technical data while simultaneously probing printed circuit boards. Current commercial products equipped with our OLED microdisplays in these sectors include those produced by BCF, Liteye, FLIR Systems, Nordic NeuroLab, VRmagic GmbH, and Sensics, among others.
 ﻿
 Our Products
 Our first commercial microdisplay, the SVGA+ OLED, was introduced in 2001. In 2008, we introduced engineering samples of our SXGA120 OLED microdisplays and began selling significant quantities of the product in 2010. In late 2011, we began selling pre‑production samples of the WUXGA OLED microdisplay which is now qualified and in production. In 2014, we released our Digital SVGA, and in 2015, we released our smaller pixel pitch digital SXGA and SXGA096, as well as an upgrade to the SXGA120 and WUXGA. Our OLED display products are being designed in products to be manufactured by OEM customers for a wide variety of military, medical, industrial, and consumer applications. We offer our products to OEMs and other buyers as both separate components, integrated bundles coupled with our own optics, or complete systems. We also offer engineering support to enable customers to quickly integrate our products into their own product development programs and design customized displays with resolutions or features to meet specific customer requirements. In 2015, we announced the development of a prototype immersive headset that uses our prototype 2K × 2K display. During 2016, we demonstrated what we believe to be the world’s first highest brightness (~4,500 cd/m2) and highest resolution (1920x1200 pixels) microdisplay using our proprietary direct patterning method. During 2017, we developed prototype displays of our 2K x 2K display with an advanced backplane design and brightness exceeding 5,000 cd/m2.With the addition of these new displays, we now offer a wide variety of OLED microdisplay options to our customers.

SVGA+ OLED Microdisplay Series (Super Video Graphics Array of 852x600)
 The SVGA+ OLED Microdisplay Series is a 0.62 inch diagonal microdisplay that has a resolution of 852x600 triad pixels (1.53 million picture elements). The display also has an internal NTSC monochrome video decoder for low power night vision systems. The SVGA+ Rev3 OLED‑XL microdisplay is a power efficient OLED display solution for near‑eye personal viewer applications which uses less than 115 mW power in monochrome for thermal imaging applications, and lower than 175 mW at 200 cd/m2 for full color video. Digital SVGA OLED‑XL
 The Digital SVGA or DSVGA OLED‑XL was released for production in 2014. This is an 800 × 600 display with 15 micron pixels and a 0.6 inch diagonal. It has all the benefits of our other digital displays, including lower power (100 mW monochrome and 135 mW color), high (10,000 to 1) contrast, and also features a digital composite signal interface, enabling a minimal physical interface for color applications.
 SXGA096 OLED‑XL/XLS (Super eXtended Graphics Array, 1280 x 1024)
 The SXGA096 display was introduced in 2015. It features a 9.6‑micron color pixel and was designed with the same level of feature integration as the DSVGA microdisplay, as well as a low pin‑count, high speed LVDS (Low Voltage Differential Signaling) data interface. The compactness and high information content of the SXGA096 makes it ideal for small form factor applications such as commercial headsets and smart weapon sights. This microdisplay incorporates OLED XLS technology more than doubling the OLED XL brightness. This expands the range of optical solutions that can be used with this display to result in smaller and lighter display modules.
 SXGA OLED‑XL (Super eXtended Graphics Array, 1280 x 1024)
 Our SXGA OLED microdisplay with a 0.77 inch diagonal active area provides 3,932,160 sub‑pixels in an active area. The display’s pixel array comprises triads of vertical sub‑pixels stacked side by side to make up each 12 × 12mm color pixel. The SXGA OLED‑XL microdisplay offers digital signal processing, requiring less than 200mW under typical operation. The supported video formats are SXGA, 720p, DVGA (through 1280 × 960 pixel doubling), and both frame sequential and field sequential stereovision.
 VGA OLED‑XL (Video Graphics Array, 640 x 480)
 The VGA OLED‑XL microdisplay was introduced to our product line in 2011 and is our smallest (0.5 inches) and lowest powered (<60 mW monochrome/<100 mW color). The VGA OLED‑XL utilizes the same voltage pixel drive architecture and “Deep Black” technology as the SXGA and WUXGA designs and includes motion artifact reduction technology like the WUXGA. Also like the SXGA and WUXGA, the VGA provides a FPGA driver design for maximum flexibility and versatility. The VGA interface is 30‑bit digital RGB.
 WUXGA OLED‑XL (Widescreen Ultra eXtended Graphics Array, 1920 x 1200)
 Our WUXGA OLED‑XL microdisplay provides higher resolution than most HD (High Definition) flat screen televisions. With a triad sub‑pixel structure this display is built of 7,138,360 active dots at 3.2 microns each. The WUXGA OLED‑XL is built upon the voltage pixel drive approach first developed for the SXGA OLED‑XL, which provides improved uniformity, ultra‑high contrast (measured at greater than 100,000:1) and lower power. The advanced WUXGA design features our proprietary “Deep Black” architecture that ensures that off‑pixels are truly black, automatically optimizes contrast under all conditions, and delivers better pixel to pixel uniformity. The WUXGA OLED‑XL includes a low‑power, low‑voltage‑differential‑signaling (LVDS) serial interface and the overall display power requirement is typically less than 350 mW running standard video. Also included is our proprietary motion enhancement technology which smooths video display and virtually eliminates unwanted artifacts. Like the SXGA, the WUXGA provides a FPGA driver design available on a separate, lower power driver board, or as source code for integration into end product electronics giving OEM developers maximum versatility and flexibility. On‑board circuitry ensures consistent color and brightness over a wide range of operating temperatures.
 Lens and Design Reference Kits
 We offer a prism optic with mounting brackets or combined with OLED microdisplays to form an optic‑display module. We provide design reference kits, which include a microdisplay and associated electronics, to help OEMs evaluate our microdisplay products and to assist their efforts to build and test new products incorporating our microdisplays.

Integrated Modules
 We provide near‑eye virtual imaging modules that incorporate our OLED‑on‑silicon microdisplays with our lenses and electronic interfaces for integration into OEM products. We have shipped customized modules to several customers, some of which have incorporated our products into their own commercial products. Headsets
 In 2014, we developed and demonstrated a new Immersive Head Mounted Display (IHMD) with a different look and superior performance than other VR HMDs. Compared to other VR HMDs, it has four times the resolution, no pixelization, and a much smaller form factor. It incorporated our earlier 2K by 2K high‑resolution OLED microdisplay prototype and patented optics, giving it significantly sharper resolution than a cell phone display and conventional optics. The field of view (FOV) of the IHMD exceeds one hundred (100) degrees and it has a resolution of four (4) megapixels per eye. We entered into a nonexclusive license agreement in 2015 to allow an undisclosed company to use the technology in this IHMD for their own applications and may incorporate our 2K × 2K displays in headsets that use the technology. The retrofit of our latest 2K × 2K microdisplay prototypes into the original design of this IHMD is being considered as a means to showcase their superior performance and higher resolution.
 We are subject to certain export control laws, including the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Certain of our products may be deemed to be controlled for export by the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security under the EAR or by the U.S. State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) under the ITAR. Most of our ITAR products are custom displays developed for a specific military program or purpose. Failure to comply with these export control laws can lead to severe penalties, both civil and criminal, and can include debarment from contracting with the U.S. government.
 Night Vision Smartphone Camera Attachment and Goggles
 In 2016, we announced night vision products for the consumer markets and began limited sales in the first quarter of 2017. A smartphone camera attachment allows consumers to see clear, high‑resolution images in the dark. A companion application allows users to record and live stream content directly to our social media sites and share with other sites. We also developed a wearable device that utilizes our OLED microdisplay technology to provide hands‑free operation for night‑time activities with the capability to record and upload content. We are completing the development of these products and pursuing channels of distribution. Government Contract Funding
 We derive a portion of our revenue from funding that we receive pursuant to research contracts or subcontracts funded by various agencies of the U.S. government.
 In 2014, we were awarded a $5 million contract to develop and produce an ultra‑high resolution, high brightness, high contrast, full color OLED microdisplay at a low unit cost. This Defense‑wide Manufacturing Science & Technology award, also known as ManTech, is funded by the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics and is administered by the U.S. Army RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate Science and Technology Division. We earned a substantial portion of our R&D contract revenue in 2016 from this project and we expect to complete it by May 2018.
 In 2015, we were awarded two new development programs that continued into 2016. The first program is a Small Business Technology Transfer program with the Air Force Research Laboratory and the second is a Small Business Innovation Research program with the United States Special Operations Command. Both programs were for investigating improved OLED micro display design and performance and were completed in 2016.
 Our contracts with the U.S. government require us to conduct the research effort described in the statement of work section of the contract. These contracts may be modified or terminated at the discretion of the government and are subject to authorization, appropriation and allocation of the required funding on an annual basis.
     Our Strategy
     Our strategy is to strengthen our leadership position as a worldwide supplier of microdisplays and virtual imaging technology solutions for applications in high growth segments of the consumer, military and commercial electronics industry by capitalizing on our experience and expertise in active matrix OLED technology and silicon wafer design. We also plan to continue our participation in U.S. government funded Contract Research and Development programs which allows us to continue to enhance our technology. We aim to provide microdisplays and complementary accessories to enable OEM customers serving a variety of markets, including commercial, military and medical, to develop and manufacture new and enhanced electronic products. With the announcement of our 

 
9   

BlazeSpark and BlazeTorch consumer night vision products, we have also entered the consumer electronics, recreational, law enforcement and first responder markets. Some key elements of our strategy to achieve these objectives include the following:

· | Develop OEM and mass production partnerships in the consumer HMD market. As the consumer AR/VR market matures, we believe our eMagin technology is positioned well to address the requirements of this segment. Developing customer partners is key to establishing eMagin as the market leader for next generation displays for the consumer HMD market. In addition, executing on mass production partnerships should allow us to be well positioned us in a market predicted to experience significant growth through the 2020s. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strengthen our technology leadership. As the first to exploit AMOLED microdisplays and the only participant in U.S. government contract research and development programs for OLED microdisplays, we believe that we enjoy a significant advantage in bringing this technology to market. By continuing to invest in research and development, and protecting our intellectual property, we expect to further develop performance improvements and provide a competitive edge for our customers who integrate our displays into their end products. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Optimize microdisplay manufacturing efficiencies while protecting proprietary processes and partner with large volume manufacturers to bring our technology into high volume production. We intend to reduce our production costs primarily by improving manufacturing yields and lowering fixed costs through reduced cycle time and increased automation as well as equipment upgrades. We outsource certain portions of microdisplay production, such as chip fabrication, to minimize our costs and time to market. We intend to retain the OLED‑related processes in‑house, where we have a core competency and manufacturing expertise. We also believe that by keeping these processes under tight control we can better protect our proprietary technology and process know‑how. We believe that this strategy will also enhance our ability to continue to optimize and customize processes and devices to meet customer needs. In order to address emerging high volume consumer electronics OLED microdisplay requirements, we are actively seeking manufacturing partners who can help us realize that objective.

· | Build and maintain strong design capabilities. We employ in‑house design capabilities supplemented by outsourced design services. Building and maintaining this capability allows us to reduce engineering costs, accelerate the design process and enhance design accuracy to respond to our customers’ needs as new markets develop. Contracting third party design support to meet demand and for specialized design skills may also remain a part of our overall long term strategy. Given these capabilities, we continue to look for opportunities to add value to our displays to increase revenue. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leverage strategic relationships. External relationships serve an important role in our research and development efforts. Suppliers, equipment vendors, government organizations, contract research groups, external design companies, customer and corporate partners, consortia, and university relationships all enhance the overall research and development effort and help us develop new ideas and solutions. In addition, we participate in industry associations such as the Society for Information Display; SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics; the Army Aviation Association of America; and the National Defense Industrial Association; among others. We believe that strategic relationships allow us to determine better the demands of the marketplace and, as a result, allow us to focus our research and development activities on satisfying our customers’ evolving requirements.

 Backlog
     As of December 31, 2017, we had a backlog of approximately $9.8 million in comparison to a backlog of approximately $6.4 million as of December 31, 2016.  This backlog primarily consists of non-binding customer purchase orders and purchase agreements with expected delivery dates through 2018, but does not include expected revenue from research and development contracts or expected NRE (non-recurring engineering) programs under development.  Most purchase orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation by the customer with no or limited penalties.  Variations in the magnitude and duration of purchase orders and customer delivery requirements may result in substantial fluctuations in backlog from period to period.     Manufacturing Facilities  
     Our manufacturing facilities are located about 70 miles north of New York City in Hopewell Junction, NY. We lease approximately 42,000 square feet of space which houses our own equipment for OLED microdisplay fabrication and research and development, includes a 16,300 square foot class 10 clean room space, additional lower level clean room testing space, assembly space and administrative offices.
 ﻿
 Facilities services provided by the lessor include our clean room, pure gases, high purity de-ionized water, compressed air, chilled water systems, and waste disposal support. This infrastructure provided by our lease provides us with many of the resources of a larger corporation without the added overhead costs. It further allows us to focus our resources more efficiently on our product development and manufacturing goals.
     We believe manufacturing efficiency is an important factor for success, especially in the consumer markets. Although we currently have the equipment needed for profitable production in place, we purchased $1.4 million and $1.4 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, of additional equipment mainly related to manufacturing and we plan to add additional equipment in 2018 to increase capacity and yield and to meet expected demand for our microdisplays.

Our consumer/commercial night vision products are manufactured at contract manufacturing facilities located in Singapore and China and incorporate displays manufactured at our facilities in Hopewell Junction, NY, and components and subassemblies manufactured by domestic and foreign suppliers. 
 ﻿
 Competition
     The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We face competition from legacy technologies such as transmissive liquid crystal displays and liquid crystal on silicon displays as well as from alternative display technologies such as virtual scanning retinal displays. There are many large and small companies that manufacture or have in development products based on these technologies.
 There are a few manufacturers of high resolution OLED microdisplays that produce microdisplays that compete with our microdisplay products. They are Yunnan OLiGHTECK Opto‑Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. in China and MicroOLED in France. Both are shipping OLED microdisplays into the market. Sony Mobile Display Corp., in Japan, produces OLED microdisplays for integration into Sony’s own higher‑level systems such as digital cameras and HMDs and is now selling microdisplays to some commercial customers. In addition, in early 2017, Kopin Corporation announced a 2K × 2K microdisplay which includes OLEDs sourced from an existing manufacturer.
 If other new OLED‑based companies enter our markets with directly relevant display designs and without manufacturing and reliability issues, we will face additional competition, although we believe that our progress to date in this area gives us a significant advantage.
 We believe that competition will come from liquid crystal on silicon displays, small transmissive liquid crystal displays, and OLED microdisplays manufactured by competitors. While we believe our OLED technology is technically superior by providing higher quality images, greater environmental ruggedness, reduced electronics cost and complexity, and improved power efficiency microdisplays, there is no assurance that we will continue to be the dominant OLED microdisplay supplier. Competition can also come from inorganic micro LEDs, a technology still in the development stage but which could become a major competitor if all the technological hurdles are overcome.
 Our consumer night vision products may face competition from a variety of electronics manufacturers that primarily offer thermal imaging cameras and monoculars. These include manufacturers of thermal imaging video cameras and monoculars. These devices are traditionally more expensive, heavier and larger than our BlazeSpark and BlazeTorch night vision products and are primarily designed for commercial users.
 Our BlazeSpark and BlazeTorch products rely on a less expensive digital CMOS sensor and software image processing to produce viewable images though either smart phone displays or our proprietary OLED display and prism technology. While we believe our digital process technology, compact size, appealing designs, and streaming platforms offer advantages for serving consumer markets, it is possible that existing manufacturers of military and tactical night vision systems may offer consumer products, or other manufacturers may develop innovative technologies, that create increased competition.
 Intellectual Property
 We believe we have developed our own intellectual property portfolio of patents, trade secrets and manufacturing know‑how. Our intellectual property includes 34 U.S. patents and 28 U.S. patent applications. It is important to protect our investment in technology by obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights, including rights under patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws. We seek to protect inventions we consider significant by applying for patents in the United States and other countries when appropriate. The U.S. government holds licenses to much of our technology as a result of its funding a significant portion of our research and development.
 Our intellectual property covers a wide range of materials, device structures, processes, and fabrication techniques, primarily concentrated in the following areas:

· | OLED Devices, Architecture, Structures, and Processes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | Display Color Processing and Sealing;
--+--------------------------------------


· | Active Matrix Circuit Methodologies and Designs;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | Lenses and Tracking (Eye and Head);
--+------------------------------------


· | Ergonomics and Industrial Design;
--+----------------------------------

 
 
12   


· | Wearable Computer Interface Methodology;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | Legacy Field Emission and General Display Technologies; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | Head‑Mounted Display Technology.
--+---------------------------------

  We believe that, in addition to patent protection, our success is dependent upon trade secrets, technical expertise and know‑how. To protect this information and know‑how from unauthorized use or disclosure, we use nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights, and we require all employees, and where appropriate, contractors, consultants, advisors and collaborators, to enter into confidentiality and non‑competition agreements. We believe that our intellectual property portfolio, coupled with our strategic relationships and accumulated manufacturing know‑how in OLED, gives us a significant advantage over potential competitors.
 Employees
     As of January 31, 2018, we had a total of 100 employees, of which 97 were full time.  None of our employees are represented by a labor union.  We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.     Available Information
