ITEM 1.          BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
magicJack VocalTec Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a cloud communications leader that is the inventor of the magicJack devices and other magicJack products and services. magicJacks weigh about one ounce and plug into the USB port on a computer or into a power adapter and high speed Internet source, providing users with complete phone service for home, enterprise and while traveling. The Company charges highly competitive rates for the right to access its servers (“access right”), and the Company’s customers then continue to have the ability to obtain free telephone services. The Company currently offers the magicJack GO and magicJack EXPRESS, which are updated versions of the magicJack device that have their own CPU and can connect a regular phone directly to the user’s broadband modem/router and function as a standalone phone without using a computer.  The magicJack mobile apps are applications that allow users to make and receive telephone calls through their smart phones using their magicJack account. Currently, consumers that do not have a magicJack account can purchase and download the magicJack mobile apps to make telephone calls from anywhere in the world into the U.S. or Canada for free.  The mobile apps include the magicApp and the magicJack Connect App, which are available for both iOS and Android. The Company’s products and services allow users to make and/or receive free telephone calls to and from anywhere in the world where the customer has broadband access to the Internet, and allow customers to make free calls back to the United States and Canada from anywhere legally permitted in the world.

magicJack VocalTec is a vertically integrated group of companies. The Company owns a micro-processor chip design company, an Appserver and session border controller company, a wholesale provider of Voice-over-Internet-Protocol (“VoIP”) services, a softphone company, and the developer and provider of the magicJack device. The Company also wholesales telephone service to VoIP providers and telecommunication carriers.
 
The Company’s strategy since 2007 has been to vertically integrate its technology, design and suppliers, and it has completed four acquisitions between 2007 and 2010, including a merger with the company that invented VoIP, in order to implement this strategy.
 
From 2011 through 2015, the Company has offered several versions of the magicJack device and mobile apps.  The device has been progressively upgraded to include superior voice quality, expanded memory and enhanced processing power. The initial access right period for the different versions of the device ranged from three to twelve months.
 
In March 2016, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of North American Telecommunications Corporation (dba “Broadsmart”). Broadsmart is a hosted Unified Communication as a Service (“UCaaS”) provider for medium-to-large multi-location enterprise customers. Broadsmart has experience provisioning and delivering complex UCaaS solutions to corporate customers on a nationwide basis. Broadsmart services multi-location, geographically diverse enterprises. With the acquisition of Broadsmart, the Company has diversified its operations into UCaaS targeting high end enterprise customers. This acquisition was intended to position the Company to compete long-term in the UCaaS market.
 
During the first quarter of 2016, the Company created a new subsidiary, magicJack SMB, Inc. (“SMB”). Through this subsidiary, the Company provides easy-to-buy, simple-to-use VoIP services to small to medium sized businesses at competitive prices. The Company began sales of its SMB product during the third quarter of 2016. During 2017, the Company rolled back its investment in the SMB product and launched the magicJack “Spark” product, a business focused mobile App product.
 
The Company has historically prepared its consolidated financial statements on the basis of being a single reporting entity. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the Company has been reporting the results of operations for these new business lines as separate Reportable Segments – “Core Consumer,” “Enterprise” and “SMB”. These segments are organized by the products and services that are sold and the customers that are served. The Core Consumer segment represents the historical magicJack consumer business.  The Enterprise segment includes Broadsmart and the SMB segment includes SMB.  Refer to Note 16, “Segment Reporting,” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 herein for further details.
 
In May 2016, we launched the magicJack Connect App for iOS and Android. The magicJack Connect App offers users free worldwide Wi-Fi App-to-App calling & messaging. The App also offers an unlimited U.S. calling plan which allows subscribers to call the U.S. from anywhere in the world plus receive a U.S. phone number for only $9.99 per year.
 
On November 9, 2017, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with B. Riley Financial, Inc. (“B. Riley”), in which B. Riley proposes to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company for $8.71 per share. The purchase price of $8.71 per share represents a premium of approximately (i) 18.5% over the closing price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on March 14, 2017, the last completed trading day prior to the date that the Company announced that it had received unsolicited indications of interest and would be considering its strategic alternatives, (ii) 23.6% over the 90-day average closing price of the Company’s ordinary shares for the period ended November 7, 2017, and (iii) 54.2% over the closing price of the Company’s ordinary shares on November 8, 2017, the last completed trading day prior to the Company’s announcement that it entered into the Merger Agreement. The Transaction is subject to various closing conditions, including Company shareholder approval and regulatory approvals.  A Special Meeting of the Shareholders is scheduled for March 19, 2018, to vote on the Transaction.  The Company anticipates completing the Transaction in the first half of 2018.
 
The Company’s corporate name is magicJack VocalTec Ltd. for both legal and commercial purposes. The Company is located at 12 Haomanut Street, 2nd Floor, Poleg Industrial Area, Netanya, Israel 4250445 (telephone number +972-9-970-3888). The Company was organized under the laws of the State of Israel in 1989 and is subject to the Israeli Companies Law, or the Companies Law. The Company’s subsidiary, YMax Corporation (“YMax”, and together with VocalTec, the “Combined Company”), is located at 560 Village Blvd.,  Suite 120, West Palm Beach, Florida, 33409 (telephone number 561-749-2255).

Markets Where We Compete
 
The primary market in which the Company currently competes is the United States. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 98% of its property and equipment, net of depreciation, is located in the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 86% of its consolidated revenues were derived from sales to customers located in the United States.  The remaining 14% of consolidated revenues were primarily derived from sales in Canada.
Business Seasonality
 
The Company’s revenues are not subject to seasonal fluctuations. However, quarterly revenue amounts are impacted by the timing of customer renewals and the revenues for Broadsmart can be impacted by the timing of non-recurring equipment and other sales.
Manufacturing
 
In 2006, the Company entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with a Chinese company to manufacture the magicJack devices. Certain components of the magicJack device are built for the Company, based on the Company’s specifications, in Taiwan and Hong Kong and then sent to the Chinese manufacturer in China for final assembly.
 
The Company’s supply chain and third party manufacturing arrangements are structured to allow the Company to control product quality, realize cost efficiencies and minimize the risks associated without having to disclose proprietary technology to multiple outside parties during production. The Company’s strategy since 2007 has been to vertically integrate the Company’s technology and design suppliers, and the Company has completed three acquisitions since 2007 to implement this strategy. As a result of these strategic acquisitions, the Company controls practically every stage in the design of the Company’s products. Certain magicJack device parts are sourced directly by the production facility in China. The Company works closely with our suppliers to plan inventory procurement in quantities that will meet customer demand while minimizing inventory risks. The Company purchases components and sub-assemblies through separate purchase orders and does not currently have any long-term purchase contracts with these suppliers. Prices of our components have not fluctuated significantly in the past three fiscal years.
 
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
 
For its Core Consumer business, the Company has relied on various marketing methods to advertise its products, including digital marketing and long and short form television commercials. The Company currently distributes the magicJack devices through retail outlets, including Walmart, Best Buy, Fry’s and others, as well as through direct sales via the Company’s web-site.
 
For its Enterprise business, Broadsmart has not historically marketed through traditional advertising channels but has relied on direct sales and a network of strong, established third party re-seller relationships.
 
In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, sales of the magicJack devices through retail outlets represented approximately 53%, 52% and 67%, respectively, of sales of all magicJack devices sold.  For the same periods, direct sales represented approximately 47%, 48% and 33%, respectively, of magicJack devices sold.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, no retailer accounted for more than 10% of operating revenues for the Core Consumer or SMB segments. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, two customers accounted for approximately 29% of operating revenues for the Enterprise segment: Advance Auto Parts of 18% and Lewis, Brisbois, Bisgaard & Smith of 11%.
 
Competition
 
The Company’s Core Consumer business faces competition from traditional telephone companies, wireless companies, cable companies and alternative voice communication providers. Some of our principal competitors are the traditional telephone service providers, such as AT&T, Inc., CenturyLink, Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., which provide telephone service based on the public switched telephone network. Some of these traditional providers also have added or are planning to add broadband telephone services to their existing telephone and broadband offerings. The Company also faces, or expects to face, competition from cable companies, such as Cablevision Systems Corp., Charter Communications, Inc., Comcast Corporation, Cox Communications, Inc. and Time Warner Cable (a division of Time Warner Inc.), which have added or are planning to add broadband telephone services to their existing cable television, voice and broadband offerings. Further, wireless providers, including AT&T Mobility, Inc., Sprint Nextel Corporation, T-Mobile USA Inc., Verizon Wireless, Inc. and Clearwire Corporation, offer services that some customers may prefer over wireline-based service. In the future, as wireless companies offer more minutes at lower prices, their services may become more attractive to customers as a replacement for wireline-based service. Some of these providers may be developing a dual mode phone that will be able to use broadband telephone service where broadband access is available and cellular phone service elsewhere, which will pose additional competition to our offerings.

The Company faces competition on magicJack device sales from Apple, Samsung and other manufacturers of smart phones, tablets and other hand held wireless devices. Also, the Company competes against established alternative voice communication providers, such as Vonage, Google Voice, and Skype, which are other non-interconnected voice providers, and may face competition from other large, well-capitalized Internet companies, such as America Online, Inc., Yahoo! Inc. and others.  In addition, the Company competes with independent broadband telephone service providers.
 
Because most of its customers are purchasing communications services from one or more of these providers, success is dependent upon the Company’s ability to attract customers away from their existing providers. The Company competes primarily through the quality and cost structure of its infrastructure and its low pricing.
 
The Company’s new Enterprise segment and SMB business operate in a highly competitive market for business voice services which includes some of the same large competitors as its Core Consumer business (AT&T and Vonage) as well as other smaller competitors such as 8x8, Inc., Ooma, RingCentral, ShoreTel and Inteliquent.
 
Many of the Company’s actual and potential competitors enjoy greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more varied products and services and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than the Company does. In addition, the Company may also face future competition from new market entrants.

The Company believes that its large existing user base, competitive pricing, efficient customer acquisition model, low cost service delivery and customer care capabilities, position us well to compete effectively in the future.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Company believes that the improvement of existing products and services, its technologies and the development of new products are important in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. The Company believes that the value of its products is dependent, to a certain extent, upon the maintenance of intellectual property rights, the license rights to use certain intellectual property rights, trade secrets or copyright protection of its proprietary software and technologies. The Company relies on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and patents, together with non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements, to establish and protect the technology used in its products.
 
magicJack VocalTec and its wholly-owned subsidiaries hold numerous patents in the United States and other countries with respect to certain technologies employed and to be employed in its products. In addition, VocalTec or its wholly owned subsidiaries have obtained licenses (in one case, an exclusive license) from other patent owners to use technology protected by those patents.
 
The Company’s U.S. trademark registrations include VocalTec & Design, MAGICJACK, MAGICJACK PLUS, MAGICJACK APP, MAGICJACK Sensory/Sound Mark and MAGICJACKGO. Trademark applications for MAGICJACK AMERICA, MAGICJACKEXPRESS (stylized), M & App Icon Design, MAGICAPP & Design and MAGICJACK CONNECT are pending in the United States. Outside the United States, trademark registrations for the MAGICJACK house mark have been obtained in Canada, China, the European Union, El Salvador, India, Mexico and Peru. The Company also owns Canadian trademark registrations for MAGICJACK PLUS and MAGICJACK APP, as well as, Canadian trademark applications for M & App Icon Design, MAGICAPP & Design, and MAGICJACKEXPRESS (stylized). Additionally, the Company has been granted trademark registrations for M & App Icon Design, MAGICAPP & Design, MAGICJACK AMERICA, MAGICJACKEXPRESS (stylized), and MAGICJACKGO in Mexico. These trademarks are important to our business. Although we have omitted the “®” and “tm” trademark designations for such trademarks in this annual report, all rights to such trademarks are nevertheless reserved. All other trademarks or registered trademarks used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the property of their respective owners.
 
 7
 
The Company relies on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect its intellectual property worldwide. The Company has filed numerous foreign and domestic patent right applications directed to its magicJack device and other products with E911 capability, emergency call routing, emergency call location determination, and other technologies. At present, the Company owns seven issued utility patents and two issued design patents in the United States, and it is the licensee (in one case, the exclusive licensee) of several issued U.S. patents. The Company is also actively researching new technologies and improvements to its existing technologies and intends to pursue intellectual property right protection for these technologies to the extent permissible by law and prudent for its business. The patents owned by the Company expire through or by April 2032. Many of the Company’s software and communication solutions have been developed internally and are proprietary.
 
Although the Company does not believe that its products infringe any valid claim of a patent owned by any third party, third parties have asserted infringement and other claims against it from time to time. These claims have been directed at certain basic and fundamental components of the Company’s products. There can be no assurance that third parties will not assert such claims against the Company in the future or that such claims will not be successful.
 
Effects of Governmental Regulations
 
In the United States, the Company’s Enterprise and SMB segments are subject to federal regulation under the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC” or the “Commission”) and various state and local regulations. The Company believes that, under current regulations, the Company’s Core Consumer segment, and its magicJack, LP subsidiary, is not an interconnected VoIP provider subject to those regulations.
 
The Company provides broadband telephone services using VoIP technology and/or services treated as information services by the FCC. The Company is also licensed as a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (“CLEC”) and is subject to extensive federal and state regulation applicable to CLECs. The FCC has to date asserted limited statutory jurisdiction and regulatory authority over the operations and offerings of certain providers of broadband telephone services, including non-interconnected VoIP. FCC regulations may now, or may in the future, be applied to the Company’s broadband telephone operations. Other FCC regulations apply to the Company because it provides international calling capability. Some of the Company’s operations are also subject to regulation by state public utility commissions (“PUCs”).
 
Intercarrier Compensation
 
On November 18, 2011, the FCC released a Report and Order (the "FCC Order") and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that comprehensively reforms the system under which regulated service providers compensate each other for terminating interstate and intrastate traffic. Regulated service providers are free to negotiate alternative arrangements, but the FCC Order establishes default rates in the absence of agreements between regulated service providers. The rules adopted by the FCC provide for a multiyear transition to a national bill-and-keep framework as the ultimate end state for all telecommunications traffic terminated by a local exchange carrier. Under bill-and-keep, providers do not charge an originating carrier for terminating traffic and instead recover the costs of termination from their own customers.
 
Pursuant to the FCC Order, rates are lowered for the most common termination functions performed by regulated service providers when exchanging traffic. The transition period depends on the type of regulated service provider. After the relevant transition is complete, service providers will be required to recoup certain termination costs directly from their customers and not from other service providers. As part of this transition, depending on the particular function performed and the type of regulated service provider, the rate for inter- and intrastate traffic was reduced to $0.0007 per minute effective July 1, 2016 for the most common termination functions performed by price cap regulated service providers and their competitors. Beginning July 1, 2018, these regulated service providers must recover the costs associated with the provision of terminating services from their customers rather than from other service providers.
 
The FCC Order also establishes new rules concerning traffic exchanged over Public Switch Telephone Network (“PSTN”) facilities that originates or terminates in Internet Protocol format, referred to as “VoIP-PSTN” traffic. As with traditional and wireless telecommunications traffic, regulated service providers will ultimately be required to recoup all costs associated with terminating such traffic from their customers. But as part of the transition to that end point, the FCC Order adopts a VoIP-PSTN specific framework for compensation between regulated service providers, establishing two rates for such traffic: toll and local. The toll rate will match the relevant interstate access rate for traditional telecommunications traffic and the local rate will match the reciprocal compensation rate associated with traditional telecommunications traffic. Further, the FCC Order allows regulated service providers to tariff charges associated with handling VoIP-PSTN traffic in a manner consistent with the FCC’s rules, which took effect on December 29, 2011.
 
The FCC Order broadly reformed the system of default rates that apply to payments between regulated service providers going forward, but did not resolve past disputes. While the rates for termination of VoIP-PSTN traffic are ultimately reduced, the FCC's ruling may provide the certainty needed to collect interstate access charges for such traffic during the transition to bill-and-keep. To the extent that another provider were to assert that the traffic we exchange with them is subject to higher levels of compensation than we, or the third parties terminating our traffic to the PSTN, pay today (if any), our termination costs could initially increase, but ultimately will be reduced as the intercarrier compensation system transitions to bill-and-keep.

The FCC clarified in January 2015 that its VoIP symmetry rule does not require a CLEC or its VoIP provider partner to provide the physical last-mile facility to the VoIP provider’s end user customers in order to provide the functional equivalent of end office switching, and thus for the CLEC to be eligible to assess access charges for this service. The ruling confirms that the VoIP symmetry rule is technology and facilities neutral and applies regardless of whether a CLEC’s VoIP partner is a facilities-based or over-the-top VoIP provider. However, in November 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the FCC’s ruling. The Company cannot predict how the D.C. Circuit’s decision will affect the amounts the Company collects and/or pays to other providers in connection with the exchange of its traffic.
 
E911 Calling
 
The FCC has required providers of interconnected VoIP services to provide 911 emergency calling capabilities to their customers. While the Company believes it is not an interconnected VoIP provider as currently defined by the FCC and thus is not subject to the FCC’s 911 rules, it nevertheless provides some 911 capability for its customers. In September 2010, the FCC released a nationwide industry "Notice of Inquiry" seeking additional comments on a number of issues including, but not limited to, whether nomadic interconnected VoIP providers should be required to offer automatic location information of their users without customers providing location information. The FCC also sought comment on how far it can extend E911 obligations to other types of companies including device manufacturers, software developers and others. In July 2011, the FCC released a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, seeking comment on various issues including (i) whether to apply the FCC's 911 rules to "outbound-only" interconnected VoIP services (i.e., services that support outbound calls to the PSTN but not inbound voice calling from the PSTN); (ii) whether to develop a framework for ensuring that all covered VoIP providers can provide automatic location information for VoIP 911 calls; and (iii) whether to revise the FCC's definition of interconnected VoIP service to require an "Internet connection" rather than a broadband connection, and to "define connectivity in terms of the ability to terminate calls to all or substantially all United States E.l64 telephone numbers." As part of the same release, the FCC included a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that sought comment on whether any amendment of the definition of interconnected VoIP service should be limited to 911 purposes, or should apply more broadly to other contexts. In September 2011, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on what role the FCC should play to facilitate the implementation of "next generation" 911 capabilities, including, for example, the short-term implementation of text-to-911 solutions; the prioritization of 911 traffic, especially during times of natural and manmade disasters; long-term implementation of IP-based alternatives for delivering text, photos, videos, and other data to 911; and the path towards integration and standardization of IP-based text-to-91l. At this time, the Company cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings nor can it predict their potential impact on its business. The Company’s VoIP E911 services are more limited than the 911 services offered by traditional wireline telephone companies. These limitations may cause significant delays, or even failures, in callers' receipt of emergency assistance.
 
Many state and local governments have sought to impose fees on customers of VoIP providers, or to collect fees from VoIP providers, to support implementation of E911 services in their area. Such fees are often put in terms of a fee placed on monthly bills, or focused on use from a specific location. The application of such fees with respect to magicJack users and the Company is not clear because various statutes and regulation may not cover the Company's services, the Company does not bill its customers monthly, nor does it bill customers at all for telecommunications services. The Company may also not know the end user's location because the magicJack devices and services are nomadic. If fees are owed, they are owed by the end user and not the Company, as most statutes, to the extent they apply, would have the Company act as a billing and collection agent. Should a regulatory authority require payment of money from the Company for such support, magicJack LP may decide to not offer its 911 service in that area or to develop a mechanism to collect fees from its customers, which may or may not be satisfactory to the entity requesting us to be a billing agent. The Company cannot predict whether the collection of such additional fees or limitations on where its services are available would impact customers’ interest in purchasing its products.
 
In 2013 as a result of settlement of litigation, the Company agreed that it would, at least once a year, issue bills for 911 emergency calling services to all U.S. customers who have access to 911 services through their magicJack services, and who have provided a valid address in a U.S. jurisdiction that provides access to 911 services and which is legally empowered to impose 911 charges on such users in accordance with applicable state and/or local law. 
 
Certain E911 regulatory authorities have asserted or may assert in the future that the Company is liable for damages, including end user assessed E911 taxes, surcharges and/or fees, for not having billed and collected E911 fees from its customers in the past or in the future. Although the Company strongly disagrees with these assertions and believes that any such authority’s claims are without merit, if a jurisdiction were to prevail, the decision could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
 
Network Neutrality
 
On January 14, 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Verizon v. FCC, struck down major portions of the FCC’s 2010 “net neutrality” rules governing the operating practices of broadband Internet access providers. The FCC originally designed the rules to ensure an “open Internet” and included three key requirements for broadband providers: 1) a prohibition against blocking websites or other online applications; 2) a prohibition against unreasonable discrimination among Internet users or among different websites or other sources of information; and 3) a transparency rule compelling the disclosure of specific information about the broadband service, including network management policies. The Court struck down the first two rules, concluding that they constitute “common carrier” restrictions that are not permissible given the FCC’s earlier decision to classify Internet access as an “information service,” rather than a “telecommunications service.” The Court upheld the FCC’s transparency rule.

In response to the D.C. Circuit’s decision, the FCC released an order in March 2015 adopting new net neutrality rules. In doing so, the FCC reclassified broadband Internet access - the retail broadband service mass-market customers buy from cable, phone, and wireless providers - as a telecommunications service regulated under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, although the FCC agreed to forbear from many requirements of Title II. Significantly, these rules applied equally to fixed and mobile broadband networks.
 
The FCC adopted three new bright-line rules as follows:
 
 
· | No Blocking: Broadband providers may not block access to legal content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No Throttling: Broadband providers may not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No Paid Prioritization: Broadband providers may not favor some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind - in other words, no “fast lanes.” This rule also banned Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The FCC also adopted a fourth “general conduct” rule in the form of a forward-looking standard. This rule was intended to address concerns that may arise with new practices that do not fall within one of the three bright line rules by prohibiting questionable practices that unreasonably interfered with or unreasonably disadvantage the ability of consumers to use or for providers to make available lawful content, applications, services, or devices.  The FCC also adopted enhanced transparency requirements with which broadband providers must comply.
 
After the FCC’s new net neutrality rules went into effect in June 2015, various broadband providers and their trade associations challenged the FCC’s decision before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  In June 2016, the D.C. Circuit issued its decision upholding the FCC’s rules. The D.C. Circuit also denied various parties have filed petitions seeking rehearing en banc of the D.C. Circuit court’s decision.  Various parties have sought review by the United States Supreme Court of the D.C. Circuit’s decision, which remains pending, and the current FCC chairman had expressed his intent to revisit the FCC’s rules.  The Company cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.
 
In December 2017, the FCC adopted its “Restoring Internet Freedom Order,” which: 1) restored the classification of broadband Internet access services as unregulated information services, ending Title II regulation of these services; 2) eliminated the FCC’s three “bright-line” net neutrality rules; 3) eliminated the FCC’s “general conduct” rule; and 4) adopted a new transparency rule.  The “Restoring Internet Freedom Order” has been published in the Federal Register and will take effect on April 23, 2018, except for the new transparency rule, which will not take effect until approved by the Office of Management and Budget.
 
Multiple parties have filed petitions seeking judicial review of the “Restoring Internet Freedom Order,” which have been consolidated and assigned for hearing by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (which may be asked to transfer the case to the D.C. Circuit).  The Company cannot predict how these challenges will be resolved.  However, a decision by a court upholding the FCC decision to eliminate legal prohibitions against broadband providers blocking, throttling, or otherwise degrading the quality of the Company’s data packets or attempting to extract additional fees from the Company or its customers could adversely impact the Company’s business.  A court also could find that the FCC lacks legal authority to regulate broadband services, which could prevent a future FCC from adopting new rules to govern the operating practices of broadband providers.
 
Universal Service Fund (“USF”) and Other Funds
 
The FCC and many PUCs have established USF programs to ensure that affordable telecommunications services are widely available in high cost areas and for low income telephone subscribers and to promote universal availability of modern networks capable of providing voice and broadband service. In addition to USF, the FCC imposes other fees to meet the costs of establishing and maintaining a numbering administration system, to recover the shared costs of long-term number portability, and to contribute to the Telecommunications Relay Services (“TRS”) Fund. All telecommunications carriers and other providers are required to contribute to these funds, including interconnected VoIP providers. The FCC and many PUCs have for a number of years been considering substantial changes to the USF system including changes in contribution methodology. Some proposals, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
On Thursday, December 14, 2017, the Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 to reverse its 2015 order classifying the provision of broadband internet access services as a “telecommunication service” subject to Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, and restoring the classification of broadband internet access services as an “information service” under Title I of the Communications Act.  This reclassification moves the provision of broadband internet services from treatment as a utility (with greater governmental oversight over the provision of the utility’s services) to treatment as another offering by a telecommunications service provider.

The December 14, 2017 Order consequentially rescinds the rules prohibiting blocking of lawful internet content and applications, throttling or degrading lawful internet traffic, and paid prioritization of certain internet traffic.  These three prohibitions form the core of the “net neutrality” rules – essentially, the rules that required all internet traffic to be treated equally.
 
The order was made public on January 4, 2018, and the Company anticipates that various state attorneys general and others who want to reverse the repeal will challenge the FCC’s decision. The repeal itself is not yet final since it takes effect 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.
 
The FCC has also indicated its intent to reexamine the current USF contribution methodology, which may include requiring contributions based on revenues from broadband and other Internet Protocol-based services.  The Company cannot predict how any changes to the current USF contribution methodology may affect its business at this time. 
 
On February 3, 2015, the FCC released a policy statement for a new methodology for calculating forfeitures for violations of the USF and other federal program payment rules. Under the new treble damages methodology, each violator’s apparent base forfeiture liability will be three times its delinquent debts to the USF, TRS fund, Local Number Portability (“LNP”) fund, North American Numbering Plan (“NANP”) fund, and regulatory fee programs. As before, each single failure to pay a federal program assessment constitutes a separate violation that continues until the assessment is fully paid. The methodology will be used in future enforcement actions, although a group of industry trade associations have petitioned the Commission for review and a stay of this methodology. At this time the Company cannot predict the impact, if any, this policy statement will have on the Company’s operations in the event the Company is found to have violated the Communications Act or FCC rules.
 
Customer Privacy and Promotional Activities
 
The Company is subject to various federal and state laws and regulations seeking to protect the privacy of customers’ personal information that restrict the Company’s ability to use such information for marketing and promotional purposes. The FCC limits telephone companies’ and interconnected VoIP providers’ use of customer proprietary network information (“CPNI”) such as telephone calling records without customer approval, and requires those companies to protect CPNI from disclosure. Federal and state laws also limit the Company’s and other companies’ ability to contact customers and prospective customers by telemarketing, email or fax to advertise services.
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (“CALEA”)
 
In September 2005, the FCC concluded that interconnected VoIP service providers must comply with the CALEA and configure their network and services to support law enforcement activity in the area of wiretaps and call records. The Company provides CALEA-compliant services even though the Company believes it is not an interconnected VoIP provider subject to CALEA.
 
Services for the Disabled
 
Interconnected VoIP providers and manufacturers of specially designed equipment used to provide those services must take steps to ensure that individuals with disabilities, including hearing impaired and other disabled persons, have reasonable access to their services, if such access is readily achievable.  The Company believes it is not an interconnected VoIP provider as currently defined by the FCC.
 
Number Portability
 
The FCC requires interconnected VoIP providers to comply with LNP rules that allow subscribers remaining in the same geographic area to switch from a wireless, wireline or VoIP provider to any other wireless, wireline or VoIP provider and keep their existing phone numbers. The Company provides LNP, even though the Company believes it is not an interconnected VoIP service provider subject to the LNP rules.
Outage Reporting
 
In 2012, the FCC adopted a Report and Order requiring interconnected VoIP providers to report significant service outages to the FCC. The Report and Order defines outage reporting for interconnected VoIP service, establishes reporting criteria and thresholds, and discusses how the reporting process should work, what information should be reported, and confidential treatment of the outage reports. The Company believes it is not an interconnected VoIP provider subject to the outage reporting rules.
 
 11
 

Discontinuance of Service Reporting
 
The FCC requires interconnected VoIP providers to file an application with the Commission and obtain approval prior to discontinuing, reducing, or impairing service. The Company believes it is not an interconnected VoIP provider subject to the service discontinuance rules.
 
Annual Traffic and Revenue Reports
 
In January 2013, the FCC extended annual traffic and revenue reporting requirements to non-interconnected VoIP service providers.  Carriers engaged in providing international telecommunications service, and companies engaged in providing VoIP service connected to the PSTN, between the United States and any foreign point are required to file a report with the Commission showing revenues, payouts, and traffic for international telecommunications service and VoIP service connected to the PSTN provided during the preceding calendar year. The FCC is considering eliminating or narrowing its current international traffic reporting requirements.  At this time the Company cannot predict the impact, if any, that these reporting requirements will have on the Company’s operations.
Broadband and Telephone Competition Reporting
 
Interconnected VoIP service providers, facilities-based providers of broadband connections to end user locations, providers of wired or fixed wireless local exchange telephone service, and facilities-based providers of mobile telephony service are required to submit to the FCC on an annual basis a Broadband and Telephone Competition Report.  Through the report the FCC collects information to analyze the deployment of broadband infrastructure and competition. The Company believes it is not an interconnected VoIP provider subject to submitting a Broadband and Telephone Competition Report.
Effects of State Regulations
 
The Company has been, and will continue to be, subject to a number of PUC and other state regulations that govern the terms and conditions of the Company’s offerings, including billing practices, 911 fees, distribution of telephone numbers, customer disputes and other consumer protection matters. The Company cannot predict the outcome of current or future proceedings, nor can it predict the potential impact on the Company's business.
Rural Call Completion Reporting
 
To the extent a covered provider makes the initial long-distance path choice for more than 100,000 domestic retail subscriber lines, the provider is subject to the FCC’s record retention and reporting requirements.  Specifically, the provider must record and retain information about call attempts to rural operating company numbers (“OCN”s) and must submit certified reports for call attempts to both rural and non-rural OCNs. The FCC’s Wireline Competition Bureau has clarified that: (1) covered providers may not count unanswered call attempts as answered calls under the FCC’s data retention and reporting rules; and (2) the explanatory notes in Appendix C of the FCC’s Order that describe “answered” calls and “busy,” “ring no answer,” and “unassigned number” call attempts are intended to serve as examples rather than exclusive definitions. As part of their quarterly reports to the FCC, covered providers should explain the method they used to identify these call attempt categories. The Company is currently collecting and reporting the required data. At this time, the Company cannot predict the impact, if any, that these reporting requirements will have on the Company’s operations.
State and Municipal Taxes
 
The Company believes that it files all required state and municipal tax returns and pays all required state and municipal taxes (such as sales, excise, utility, and ad valorem taxes), fees and surcharges. The Company’s Enterprise and SMB segments remit state and municipal taxes as required in the states where they are registered to do business. The Company believes that its Core Consumer segment is exempt from certain taxes, fees and surcharges because it does not charge for telephone services or render bills to its customers. The Company’s Core Consumer segment remits sales tax in Florida on sales of magicJack units because of the personnel, property and activities of its magicJack LP subsidiary that are in Florida. Certain states and municipalities may disagree with the Company’s policies regarding the Core Consumer business and may believe it should be remitting taxes for past or future sales on certain items or services. Although the Company strongly disagrees and believes any possible claims are without merit, if a state or municipality were to prevail, the decision could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operation. magicJack LP does not have activities or have representation in any other states. However, many states are changing their statutes and interpretations thereof as part of new streamlined sales tax initiatives to collect sales taxes from nonresident vendors that sell merchandise over the Internet to in state customers. The Company’s Core Consumer segment may at some time be required to collect and remit sales taxes to states other than Florida. The Company’s Core Consumer business may also become required to pay other taxes, fees and surcharges to a large number of states and municipalities as a result of statutory changes in the basis on which such taxes, fees and surcharges are imposed. In the event that the Company’s Core Consumer segment is required to collect sales taxes or other taxes from direct sales for states other than Florida on the sale of magicJack devices or on the renewal of our service offerings, the Company will bill and collect such taxes from our customers. The Company will examine any future fees and surcharges imposed as a result of statutory changes and determine on a case by case basis whether to bill its customers or increase the initial or access right sales prices to cover the additional fees and surcharges.

Regulatory Environment
 
In addition to the foregoing regulations to which the Company may be subject directly, changes to FCC and PUC regulations could affect the services, and the terms and conditions of service, the Company is able to provide. Moreover, changes to any regulations to which the Company is subject directly or indirectly could create uncertainty in the marketplace that could reduce demand for its services, increase the cost of doing business as a result of costs of litigation or increased service delivery cost or could in some other manner have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Any new legislation or regulation, or the application of laws or regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to the Company’s business, could have a material adverse effect on its business.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had 136 full-time employees, of whom 116 were in the United States, 9 were in Poland and 11 were in Israel. The Company’s employees are not represented by a labor union. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are good. In Israel, the Company’s relations with employees are governed by labor regulations that provide for specific terms of employment between the Company and its employees.
 
Neither the Company’s employees nor the Company are parties to any collective bargaining agreements, except for provisions of such agreements that are applicable to the industry in which the Company is engaged by virtue of expansion orders of the Israeli Ministry of Labor and Welfare issued under applicable Israeli laws.
