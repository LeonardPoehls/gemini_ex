ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

The Company
We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, manages, acquires, develops and redevelops shopping centers and retail properties located primarily in supply constrained suburban and urban communities. We were organized as a Maryland corporation in 1992, completed our initial public offering in 1998, and have elected to be taxed as a REIT since 1995.
As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio comprised 122 properties, including 101 retail properties and five non-retail properties totaling approximately 12.8 million square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, 10 development or redevelopment properties with approximately 2.3 million square feet of GLA, and six land parcels. As of December 31, 2016, our retail occupancy excluding developments and redevelopments was 95.8% and included national, regional and local tenants. Additionally, we had joint venture interests in six retail properties and two office buildings totaling approximately 1.4 million square feet of GLA. For a listing of the properties in our portfolio, refer to Item 2 - Properties.
In this annual report, references to “we,” “us,” “our” or "Equity One" or similar terms refer to Equity One, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries, including DIM Vastgoed, N.V., which we refer to as DIM, a Dutch company in which we acquired a controlling interest in 2009, and C&C (US) No. 1, Inc., which we refer to as CapCo, a Delaware corporation in which we acquired a controlling interest through a joint venture with Liberty International Holdings Limited, or LIH, a private company limited by shares organized under the laws of England and Wales, in 2011. In April 2015, we acquired the remaining interests held by minority shareholders in DIM, and in January 2016, we acquired LIH's interests in the CapCo joint venture.
On November 14, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Regency Centers Corporation (“Regency”) pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, we will merge with and into Regency, with Regency continuing as the surviving corporation (“Merger”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive 0.45 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of common stock of Regency (“Regency Common Stock”). During the period from the date of the Merger Agreement until the completion of the Merger, we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to engage with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals and on the conduct of our business. The proposed Merger has been unanimously approved by our board of directors and the board of directors of Regency and was approved by our stockholders and the stockholders of Regency. The closing of the Merger is expected to occur on or about March 1, 2017, subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions. There can be no assurance that all closing conditions will be satisfied by March 1, that the Merger will close on March 1 or that the Merger will be consummated at all.
For a more complete description of the Merger and related agreements, refer to our Current Report on Form 8-K and related exhibits that were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on November 15, 2016, our joint proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on January 24, 2017 and other documents that we filed with the SEC in connection with the proposed Merger. Please also review Item 1A. Risk Factors -“Risks Related to the Proposed Merger with Regency” in this annual report for a discussion of certain risks relating to the Merger.
Business Objectives and Strategies
Our principal business objective is to maximize long-term stockholder value by generating sustainable cash flow growth and increasing the long-term value of our real estate assets. Subject to applicable restrictions on the conduct of our business during the pendency of the Merger, our key strategies for reaching this objective include:

• | Operating Strategy: Maximizing the internal growth of revenue from our shopping centers and retail properties by leasing and re-leasing those properties to a diverse group of creditworthy tenants, maintaining our properties to standards that our existing and prospective tenants find attractive, as well as containing costs through effective property management;


• | Investment Strategy: Using capital wisely to renovate or redevelop our properties and to acquire and develop additional shopping centers and retail properties in supply constrained suburban and urban communities where expected, risk-adjusted returns meet or exceed our standards as well as by investing in strategic partnerships that minimize operational or other risks; and


• | Capital Strategy: Financing our capital requirements with internally generated funds, borrowings under our existing credit facilities, proceeds from selling properties that do not meet our investment criteria and proceeds from institutional partners and the debt and equity capital markets.

Operating Strategy. Subject to the pendency of the Merger, our core operating strategy is to maximize rents and maintain high occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants, as well as containing costs through effective property management. Many of our properties are located in some of the most densely populated areas of the country, including the metropolitan areas around Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Tampa, Jacksonville and Orlando, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Boston, Massachusetts; the greater New York City metropolitan area; the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area; and Los Angeles and San Francisco, California.
In order to effectively achieve our operating strategy, we seek to:

• | actively manage and maintain the high standards and physical appearance of our assets while maintaining competitive tenant occupancy costs;


• | maintain a diverse tenant base in order to limit exposure to any one tenant’s financial condition;


• | develop strong, mutually beneficial relationships with creditworthy tenants, particularly our anchor tenants, by consistently meeting or exceeding their expectations;


• | maximize rental rates upon the renewal of expiring leases or as we lease space to new tenants while limiting vacancy and down-time;


• | evaluate renovation or redevelopment opportunities that will make our properties more attractive for leasing or re-leasing to tenants and that will increase the overall value of our centers; and


• | take advantage of under-utilized land or existing square footage, or re-configure properties for better uses.

Investment Strategy. Our investment strategy is to deploy capital in high quality investments and projects in our target markets that are expected to generate risk-adjusted returns that exceed our cost of capital. Our target markets consist of California, the northeastern United States, the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, South Florida and Atlanta, Georgia. Our investments primarily fall into one of the following categories:

• | re-developing, renovating, expanding, reconfiguring and/or re-tenanting our existing properties;


• | selectively acquiring shopping centers that will benefit from our active management, leasing and redevelopment strategies with a focus on supply constrained markets;


• | selectively acquiring vacant and occupied land located in supply constrained markets for the purpose of developing new shopping centers to meet the needs of expanding retailers; and


• | investing in strategic partnerships in real estate related ventures where we act as a manager and utilize our expertise.

In evaluating potential acquisition, development and redevelopment opportunities for properties, we also consider such factors as:

• | the expected returns in relation to our cost of capital, as well as the anticipated risks we will face in achieving the expected returns;


• | the current and projected cash flow of the property and the potential to increase that cash flow;


• | the tenant mix at the property, tenant sales performance and the creditworthiness of those tenants;


• | economic, demographic, regulatory and zoning conditions in the property’s local and regional market;


• | competitive conditions in the vicinity of the property, including competition for tenants and the potential that others may create competing properties through redevelopment, new construction or renovation;


• | the level and success of our existing investments in the relevant market;


• | the current market value of the land, buildings and other improvements and the potential for increasing those market values;


• | the physical configuration of the property, its visibility, ease of entry and exit, and availability of parking; and

2


• | the physical condition of the land, buildings and other improvements, including the structural and environmental conditions.

Capital Strategy. We intend to grow and expand our business by using cash flow from operations, borrowing under our existing credit facilities, reinvesting proceeds from selling properties that no longer meet our investment criteria, accessing the capital markets to issue equity and debt or using joint venture arrangements. Our strategy is designed to help us maintain a strong balance sheet and sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investment activities in a cost-efficient way. Our strategy includes:

• | maintaining a prudent level of overall leverage and an appropriate pool of unencumbered properties that is sufficient to support our unsecured borrowings;


• | managing our exposure to variable-rate debt;


• | taking advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt and manage our debt maturity schedule;


• | selling properties that no longer fit our investment strategy, that have limited growth potential or that are not a strategic fit within our overall portfolio, and redeploying the proceeds elsewhere in our business or to pay down debt; and


• | using joint venture arrangements to access less expensive capital, mitigate capital risk, and leverage our existing personnel and internal resources.

Change in Policies
Our board of directors establishes the policies that govern our operating, investment and capital strategies, including, among others, the development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition of shopping centers, tenant and market focus, debt and equity financing policies, and quarterly distributions to our stockholders. The board may amend these policies at any time without a vote of our stockholders.
Tax Status
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1995. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we currently distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gains) to our stockholders. The difference between net income available to common stockholders for financial reporting purposes and taxable income before dividend deductions relates primarily to temporary differences, such as real estate depreciation and amortization, deduction of deferred compensation and deferral of gains on sold properties utilizing like-kind exchanges. Also, at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources. It is our intention to adhere to the organizational and operational requirements to maintain our REIT status. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax, provided that distributions to our stockholders equal at least the amount of our REIT taxable income (including net capital gains) as defined under the Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to state income or franchise taxes in certain states in which some of our properties are located and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income.
We have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, each of which we refer to as a TRS. In general, a TRS may engage in any real estate business and certain non-real estate businesses, subject to certain limitations under the Code. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes as a regular C corporation. DIM is a TRS and our investment in certain land parcels and other real estate and certain other activities are being conducted through our other TRS entities. Our current TRS activities are limited and they have not incurred any significant income taxes to date, but may do so in the future if we dispose of properties. Additionally, our operations in DIM resulted in the payment of income taxes totaling approximately $518,000 in 2016.
Governmental Regulations Affecting Our Properties
We and our properties are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental, health, safety and similar laws.
Environmental Regulations. The application of environmental laws to a specific property depends on a variety of property-specific circumstances, including the current and former uses of the property, the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property. Under certain environmental laws, we, as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned, may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances, asbestos-containing materials, or petroleum product releases at the property. We may also be held liable to a federal, state or local governmental entity or third parties for 
3

property damage, injuries resulting from the contamination and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination, whether or not we knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. Such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. We have several properties that will require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation as a result of contamination from on-site uses by current or former owners or tenants, such as gas stations or dry cleaners.
Americans with Disabilities Act. Our properties are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA. Under this act, all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The act has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” that generally require that buildings and services, including restaurants and retail stores, be made accessible and available to people with disabilities. The ADA’s requirements could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, monetary penalties or, in some cases, an award of damages.
Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing regulations, including environmental and ADA regulations, we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future. 
Competition
There are numerous commercial developers, real estate companies, REITs and other owners of real estate in the areas in which our properties are located that compete with us with respect to the leasing of our properties and in seeking land for development or properties for acquisition. Some of these competitors have substantially greater resources than we have, although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located is dominant in that market. This level of competition may reduce the number of properties available for development or acquisition, increase the cost of development or acquisition or interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants.
All of our existing properties are located in developed areas that include other shopping centers and other retail properties. The number of retail properties in a particular area could materially adversely affect our ability to lease vacant space and increase or maintain the rents charged at our existing properties. We believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting tenants in our market areas are location, price, anchor tenants and maintenance of properties. Our retail tenants also face competition from other retailers, including internet retailers, outlet stores, super centers and discount shopping clubs. This competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of our tenants.
Significant Tenants
As of December 31, 2016, no tenant accounted for more than 10% of our GLA or annual revenues. For additional information regarding our largest tenants, refer to Item 2 - Properties.
Employees
Our headquarters are located at 410 Park Avenue, Suite 1220, New York, NY 10022. As of December 31, 2016, we had 143 full-time employees and we believe that our relationships with our employees are good.
