General 
 Alcentra Capital Corporation 
 We are a specialty finance company that operates as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which we refer to as the 1940 Act. In addition, we have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code. 
 We provide customized debt and equity financing solutions to lower middle-market companies, which we define as companies having annual earnings, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of between $5 million and $25 million, and/or revenues of between $10 million and $100 million, although we may selectively make investments in larger or smaller companies. Our investments typically range in size from $5 million to $15 million. 
 Our Adviser has a history of investing in companies that seek capital to use for growth initiatives, change in ownership in leveraged buyouts or a generational change of ownership, or what we refer to as Growth Companies. We define a Growth Company as a company that has experienced growth of at least two to three times the growth rate of gross domestic product, or GDP, or have a catalyst to achieve that type of growth. It has been the experience of our Advisers investment team that Growth Companies typically incur less leverage than larger companies in order to maintain the financial flexibility to continue to invest in the growth of their businesses. In the experience of our Advisers investment team, our targeted industry sectors tend to have a greater proportion of Growth Companies and therefore offer greater investment opportunities to pursue. Our targeted industry sectors are: healthcare and pharmaceutical services; defense, aerospace, homeland security and government services; business and outsourced services; and energy services. We may also make investments in portfolio companies that do not possess these characteristics or are outside of these industry sectors. 
 Our investment activities are managed by our Adviser pursuant to the terms of an investment advisory and management agreement, which we refer to as the Investment Advisory Agreement. We expect to source investments primarily through the extensive network of relationships that the principals of our Adviser have developed with financial sponsor firms, financial institutions, middle-market companies, management teams and other professional intermediaries. 
 On May 14, 2014, we completed our initial public offering or IPO, at a price of $15.00 per share. Through our IPO we sold 6,666,666 shares for gross proceeds of approximately $100,000,000. On June 6, 2014, we sold 750,000 shares through the underwriters exercise of the overallotment option for gross proceeds of $11,250,000. 
 Portfolio Composition 
 We originate and invest primarily in lower middle-market companies (typically those with $5.0 million to $25.0 million of EBITDA) through first lien, second lien, unitranche and mezzanine debt financing, often times with a corresponding equity investment. From time to time, we may invest in companies that are larger than this but exhibit good growth characteristics. 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had $276.3 million (at fair value) invested in 32 portfolio companies. Our portfolio included approximately 34.6% of first lien debt, 30.7% of second lien debt, 26.8% of mezzanine debt and 7.8% of equity investments at fair value. At December 31, 2016, our average portfolio company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $8.8 million and $8.4 million, respectively, and 

1



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 our largest portfolio company investment by amortized cost and fair value was approximately $15.1 million and $15.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016, 58% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates (subject to interest rate floors), such as LIBOR, and 42% bore interest at fixed rates. We intend to continue to re-balance our portfolio going forward with more investments that are floating rate loans. 
 The weighted average yield on all of our debt investments as of December 31, 2016 was approximately 11.7%. The weighted average yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates for all of our debt investments, which represents the interest rate on our debt investment restated as an interest rate payable annually in arrears and is computed including cash and payment in kind, or PIK interest, as well as accretion of original issue discount. As a result, the weighted average yield figure set forth above does not represent the cash interest payments we received on our debt investments during the period noted above. In this regard, the weighted average cash yield on all of our debt investments as of December 31, 2016 was approximately 10.7%. These yields do not include the dividends, including PIK dividends, received on our preferred equity investments. PIK dividends on preferred equity functions in much the same way as PIK interest on debt investments in that it is paid in the form of additional preferred securities and not cash. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield and the weighted average cash yield will remain at their current levels. 
 The companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, our investments in such companies are not rated by any rating agency. If such investments were rated, we believe that they would likely receive a below-investment grade rating from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, which is often referred to as high-yield and junk. Exposure to below-investment grade securities involves certain risks, and those securities are viewed as having predominately speculative characteristics with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, a substantial portion of our investment portfolio consists of debt investments for which issuers are not required to make principal payments until the maturity of the loans, which may result in a substantial loss to us if such issuers are unable to refinance or repay their debt at maturity. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 15.3% of the income we received from our portfolio companies was in the form of non-cash income, such as contractual pay-in-kind, or PIK, interest. Since PIK interest involves us recognizing income without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the annual distribution requirement applicable to RICs. Our failure to meet the annual distribution requirements could reduce the amounts available for distributions. In addition, the PIK feature of our subordinated debt and preferred equity investments increases our credit risk exposure over the life of the investments given that it increases the amounts that our portfolio companies will ultimately be required to pay us. Furthermore, we have not previously been required to manage our portfolio in accordance with the RIC asset diversification requirements. See Item 1.A. Risk Factors  If we are unable to meet the RIC asset diversification requirements, we may fail to qualify as a RIC and  PIK interest payments we receive increase our assets under management and, as a result, increases the amount of base management fees and incentive fees payable by us to our Adviser.

 Our Administrator 
 We have entered into a fund administration and accounting agreement, or the Administration Agreement, with State Street Bank and Trust Company, pursuant to which State Street provides us with financial reporting, post-trade compliance, and treasury services. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, we pay a fixed annual fee, paid in monthly installments in arrears, along with additional fees and expenses as incurred each month. See Item 1. Business  Administration Agreement. 
Alcentra Middle Market 
 Alcentra Middle Market, a division of Alcentra NY, has sponsored three private investment funds that focus on subordinated debt and equity investments in middle market companies, each of which is managed by Alcentra NY. Fund III, the last of the private investment funds, was formed in 2010 and is owned by institutional, family office and private wealth investors. The Alcentra Middle Market professionals have worked together for more than 12 years and as of December 31, 2016 have invested more than $800 million in lower middle-market companies. 
 Alcentra Middle Market combines significant credit analysis, structuring capability and transactional experience within the larger credit investment platform of the Alcentra Group. 
 Alcentra Group and BNY Mellon 
 The Alcentra Group was formed in 2002 through the merger of two asset management divisions from Barclays Bank Plc in the United Kingdom and Imperial Credit Industries, Inc. In January 2006, Alcentra Group was purchased by BNY Mellon. As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, which we refer to as BNY Mellon, the Alcentra Group manages approximately $30.9 billion in below-investment grade debt assets across more than 75 investment vehicles and funds. The Alcentra Group collectively employed 127 investment professionals as of December 31, 2016. Alcentra Group is the specialist below-investment grade debt manager within BNY Mellons group of asset management boutiques. 
 BNY Mellon is one of the largest bank holding companies in the U.S. with a market capitalization of approximately $49.6 billion and is also one of the largest securities servicing organizations with $29.9 trillion of assets under custody and administration and boasts a global platform across 35 countries as of December 31, 2016. BNY Mellon is a substantial player in asset management with approximately $1.6 trillion of assets under management as of December 31, 2016. 
 BNY Mellon also maintains a substantial Wealth Management business that provides investment advisory services to high net worth individuals, families and family offices. As of December 31, 2016, BNY Mellons Wealth Management business has 41 offices, many of which are in major metropolitan offices throughout the country, and manages more than $200 billion on behalf of their clients. BNY Mellons Wealth Management group interacts regularly with privately owned businesses and the family owners thereof. The Alcentra Middle Market team maintains an active calling program on these offices as a source of deal flow and deal referrals. We utilize our access to the BNY Wealth Management platform as an important component of our network of relationships in sourcing investment opportunities. 
 Credit Facility 
 In connection with the IPO, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement (Credit Facility) with ING Capital LLC, as administrative agent and lender. The Credit Facility had an initial commitment of $80 million with an accordion feature that allows for an increase in total commitments to $160 million. The Credit Facility was amended on August 11, 2015 to increase the accordion feature to allow for a future increase of the total commitments up to $250,000,000, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions at the time of any such future increase. As amended, the Credit Facility has a maturity date of August 11, 2020 and bears interest, at our election, at a rate per annum equal to (i) 2.25% plus the highest of a prime rate, the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%, three month LIBOR plus 1.0% and zero or (ii) 3.00% plus the one, three or six month LIBOR rate, as applicable. At such time as we and certain of our subsidiaries reach a combined net worth of $230 million, the interest rate per annum will be reduced to (i) 2.00% plus the highest of a prime rate, the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%, three month LIBOR plus 1%, and zero or (ii) 3.00% plus the one, three or six month LIBOR rate, as applicable. On March 2, 2016, we amended certain provisions of the Credit Facility

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 relating to the treatment of approximately $38.6 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding InterNotes that mature prior to the Credit Facility. Among other things, the amendments to the Credit Facility provide that, in the nine-month period prior to the maturity of these particular InterNotes, which mature between February 15 and April 15, 2020, our ability to borrow under the Credit Facility will be reduced by and in the amount of such InterNotes still outstanding during such time. The Credit Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in all of our portfolio investments, the equity interests in certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries and substantially all of its other assets. We are also subject to customary covenants and events of default typical of a facility of this type. As of December 31, 2016, borrowings under the Credit Facility were $39.1 million. 
Business Strategy 
 Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation primarily by making direct investments in lower middle-market companies in the form of senior debt, unitranche, second lien, subordinated debt and, to a lesser extent, senior debt and minority equity investments. The companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, our investments in such companies will not be rated by any rating agency. If such investments were rated, we believe that they would likely receive a rating below-investment grade, which is often referred to as high-yield and junk. While our primary investment focus is to make loans to, and selected equity investments in, privately-held lower-middle-market companies, we may also make selective investments in larger or smaller companies. 
 Our business strategy to achieve our investment objective consists of (1) identifying market opportunity; (2) utilizing our competitive advantages; (3) evaluating investment opportunities and (4) sourcing, structuring and supervising investments. 
 Market Opportunity 
 We believe that the limited amount of capital available to lower middle-market companies, coupled with the desire of these companies for flexible and partnership-oriented sources of capital, creates an attractive investment environment for us. We believe the following factors will continue to provide us with opportunities to grow and deliver attractive returns to our stockholders. 
 The Lower Middle-market Represents a Large, Underserved Market.  We believe that lower middle-market companies, most of which are privately held, are relatively underserved by traditional capital providers such as commercial banks, finance companies, hedge funds and collateralized loan obligation funds. Further, we believe that companies of this size generally are less leveraged relative to their enterprise value, as compared to larger companies with a greater range of financing options. 
 Reduced Availability of Capital for Lower Middle-market Companies Presents Opportunity for Attractive Risk-adjusted Returns.  Beginning with the credit crisis that began in 2007, we believe that the subsequent exit of traditional capital providers from lower middle-market lending created a less competitive market and an increased opportunity for alternative funding sources like us to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. The remaining lenders and investors in the current environment require lower levels of senior and total leverage, increased equity commitments and more comprehensive covenant packages than were customary prior to the credit crisis. We believe that our ability to offer flexible financing solutions positions us to take advantage of this dislocation. 
 Regulatory Changes have Decreased Competition among Lower Middle-market Lenders.  We believe recent regulatory changes, including the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act and the introduction of new international capital and liquidity requirements under the Basel III Accords have caused banking institutions to curtail their lending to lower middle-market companies. As a result, we believe that less competition will facilitate higher quality deal flow and allow for greater selectivity for us throughout the investment process. 
 Large Pools of Uninvested Private Equity Capital should Drive Future Transaction Velocity.  We expect that private equity firms will remain active investors in lower middle-market companies. Private equity funds generally seek to leverage their investments by combining their equity capital with senior secured loans and/or mezzanine debt provided by other sources, and we believe that our investment strategy positions us well to partner with such private equity investors, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard. Although our interests may not always be aligned with the private equity sponsors of

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 our portfolio companies given their positions as the equity holders and our position as the debt holder in our portfolio companies, we believe that private equity sponsors will provide significant benefits including incremental due diligence, additional monitoring capabilities and a potential source of capital and operational expertise for our portfolio companies. 
 Growth Companies Typically Pursue Mezzanine Debt Cost Efficient Capital.  Mezzanine debt can be an effective source of capital for companies experiencing rapid growth. We typically focus on companies that can achieve a revenue growth rate of at least two to three times the rate of GDP growth. It is not uncommon for Growth Companies to grow faster than their bank can provide debt to support that growth. Growth Companies therefore have two primary capital market options to fund that growth: (i) raise private equity from individuals or institutions; or (ii) raise mezzanine debt capital. We believe that mezzanine debt capital can be a more cost effective alternative for Growth Companies, and can be more competitive than raising private equity capital. 
Competitive Advantages 
 Experienced Management Team.  Members of our Advisers investment committee and other investment professionals of our Adviser collectively have more than 60 years of experience investing and lending across changing market cycles. These professionals have diverse backgrounds with prior experience in investment and management positions at investment banks, small business investment companies, which we refer to as SBICs, commercial banks and privately held companies. The investment professionals of our Adviser have invested more than $800 million in debt and equity securities of primarily lower middle-market companies. We believe this experience provides our Adviser with an in-depth understanding of the strategic, financial and operational challenges and opportunities of lower middle-market companies. Further, we believe this positions our Adviser to effectively identify, assess, structure and monitor our investments. 
 Strong Transaction Sourcing Network.  Our Advisers investment professionals possess an extensive network of long-standing relationships with private equity firms, middle-market senior lenders, junior-capital partners, SBICs, financial intermediaries, law firms, accountants and management teams of privately owned businesses. We believe that the combination of these relationships and our reputation as a reliable, responsive and value-added financing partner will generate a steady stream of new investment opportunities and proprietary deal flow. 
 Access to the BNY Mellon Wealth Management Platform.  BNY Mellon maintains a substantial Wealth Management business that provides investment advisory and other services to high net worth individuals, families and family offices. BNY Mellons Wealth Management group interacts regularly with privately owned businesses and the family owners thereof. The Alcentra Middle Market team maintains an active calling program on these offices as a source of deal flow and deal referrals. We utilize our access to the BNY Wealth Management platform as an important component of our network of relationships in sourcing investment opportunities. 
 Flexible Financing Solutions.  We offer a variety of financing structures and have the flexibility to structure our investments to meet the custom needs of our portfolio companies, including among investment types and investment terms. Typically we invest in senior or subordinated debt, coupled with an equity or equity-like component to increase the total investment return profile. We believe our ability to offer a variety of financing arrangements makes us an attractive partner to lower middle-market companies and enables our Adviser to identify attractive investment opportunities throughout economic cycles and across a companys capital structure. 
 Rigorous Underwriting Policies and Active Portfolio Management.  Our Adviser has implemented rigorous underwriting policies that are followed in each transaction. These policies include an extensive review and credit analysis of portfolio companies, historical and projected financial performance as well as an assessment of the portfolio companys business model and forecasts which are designed to assess investment prospects via a thorough analysis of each potential portfolio companys competitive position, financial performance, management team operating discipline, growth potential and industry attractiveness. In addition, we structure our debt investments with protective financial covenants, designed to proactively address changes in a portfolio companys financial performance. Covenants are negotiated before an investment is completed and are based on the projected financial performance of the portfolio company. These processes are designed 

6



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 to, among other things, provide us with an assessment of the ability of the portfolio company to repay its debt at maturity. After investing in a portfolio company, we monitor the investment closely, receiving financial statements on at least a quarterly basis as well as annual audited financial statements. We analyze and discuss in detail the portfolio companys financial performance with management in addition to attending regular board meetings. We believe that our initial and ongoing portfolio review process allows us to identify and maintain superior risk adjusted return opportunities in our target portfolio companies. 
 Minimize Portfolio Concentration.  While we focus our investments in lower middle-market companies, we seek to diversify our portfolio across various industries, geographic sectors and private equity or other sponsors. We actively monitor our investment portfolio to ensure we are not overly concentrated across industries, geographic sectors or financial sponsors. By monitoring our investment portfolio in this manner we seek to reduce the effects of economic downturns associated with any particular industry sector or geographic region. 
 Access to the Alcentra Group Platform.  We seek to leverage the depth and breadth of resources of the Alcentra Group platform across all aspects of its operations, benefiting from the Alcentra Groups investment professionals, who in addition to their credit expertise, possess industry expertise. As of December 31, 2016, the Alcentra Group employs 49 analysts that closely follow a variety of industries, including healthcare, defense and business services. This unique access to in-house expertise will also be utilized in the ongoing monitoring of our investments. 
Investment Guidelines for Evaluating Investment Opportunities 
 We believe that investing in debt of privately held companies provides several potential benefits, including:
 
 | current income;
--+----------------


 | priority in capital structure;
--+-------------------------------


 | covenants and portfolio monitoring; and
--+----------------------------------------


 | predictable exits.
--+-------------------

 We use the following guidelines in evaluating investment opportunities and constructing our portfolio. However, not all of these guidelines have been, or will be, met in connection with each of our investments. 
 Current Income.  Senior term loans and mezzanine securities contractually provide either a fixed or variable coupon payable on a monthly or quarterly basis. We will seek to invest in debt securities that generate interest rate coupons of between 8  10% on our senior term loan investments, and total coupons of between 12  15% on our mezzanine investments, comprised of 10  12% paid in cash plus 2  3% paid in PIK interest. 
 Priority in Capital Structure.  In liquidation, debt holders typically are repaid first, with the remaining capital distributed to the equity holders. The structural priority of debt investing is a key component of our investment strategy to preserve capital. 
 Covenant and Portfolio Monitoring.  We seek debt investments with financial covenants, which are used to proactively address changes in a companys financial performance. Typical financial covenant tests include minimum EBITDA, total debt/EBITDA and fixed charge coverage. Covenants are negotiated before an investment is completed and are set based on the projected financial performance of the portfolio company. As the portfolio company reports monthly, quarterly or annual results, covenants are tested for compliance. If a portfolio company breaches a covenant, debt holders have several options available including waiving the covenant default, demanding repayment in full or modifying the terms of the debt in exchange for a fee or enhanced economic features, amongst others. 
 Predictable Exit.  We execute each investment with a particular exit strategy determined by a variety of factors, including the portfolio companys financial position, anticipated growth dynamics and the existing mergers and acquisitions environment. Our senior debt facilities are typically structured with little annual amortization and with principal due at maturity. Mezzanine investments are typically structured with a bullet maturity that is typically one year greater than the maturity on the senior debt facility. With either security, the

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 investment will have a finite life, whereby the portfolio company is contractually required to repay the loan. Repayment typically occurs in the event of a refinancing, recapitalization or sale/merger of the company. 
 Private Funds.  We will invest no more than 15% of our net assets in entities which would be required to be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 but for the exemptions in Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) thereunder (Private Investment Companies). Private Investment Companies include hedge funds and private equity funds. In addition, we will limit our investment in privately offered pooled investment vehicles (Private Funds) which include private REITs, private oil and gas funds, private commodity pools, private real estate funds as well as Private Investment Companies, to no more than 35% of our net assets, subject to the overall limit of investing no more than 15% of our net assets in Private Investment Companies. If we change this policy and determine to invest more than 15% of our net assets in Private Investment Companies or more than 35% of our net assets in Private Funds, we have agreed with the SEC staff to only do so after we have filed, and the SEC has declared effective, a new registration statement or a post-effective amendment to the registration statement on which this prospectus is a part. 
Transaction Sourcing and Investment Process 
 Transaction Sourcing.  We source portfolio of investments from a variety of different investment sources, including private equity sponsors, fundless sponsors, family offices, management teams, financial institutions, investment bankers, accounting firms and law firms. We have and will continue to source deal flow and referrals from the BNY Wealth Management Platform. Alcentra Middle Market has actively marketed its resources and capabilities in the middle-market for nearly 15 years, developing a network of over 5,000 transaction sources as of December 31, 2016, We believe that the breadth and depth of experience of the principals of our Adviser across different industries and transaction types, coupled with their strong relationships built from managing private funds with similar investment objectives, make the principals particularly qualified to source, analyze and execute investment opportunities. 
 Investment Process.  Our Adviser maintains a rigorous and disciplined investment process, which initiates with the sourcing of a potential transaction. Upon receiving information on a potential transaction, the information is circulated amongst the principals and the investment professionals of our Adviser and discussed during weekly investment meetings. Upon determination that a potential target has investment merit, our Adviser will schedule a meeting with the management team, investment bank, or private equity sponsor. 
 Typically, after completing a preliminary analysis of the targets information, the principals of our Adviser will decide whether to Phase I the deal for the Investment Committee. A Phase I consists of a situation overview, a company overview, key investment considerations, investment risks, information on the management team, financial data, a financial model and investment return information. If the Phase I memorandum is approved by our Advisers Investment Committee, a term sheet will be issued to the target company. Upon mutual acceptance of the term sheet, our Adviser will proceed with extensive due diligence and prepare a more substantive Phase II memorandum that is the basis for receiving a formal approval from our Advisers Investment Committee. The Phase II memorandum is a comprehensive document, typically 40  50 pages in length, which summarizes the results of our Advisers due diligence, investment thesis, investment risks and investment return projections. Investment Committee approval of the Phase II memorandum is required prior to issuing a commitment letter. Further, at least two principals of our Adviser will meet the target companys management team prior to issuing a commitment letter. Additionally, updates are provided to the Investment Committee as to any material changes in the transaction, investment thesis, or any other relevant deal point, ensuring decisions are made utilizing the most current information. 
 Deal Analysis.  For each investment opportunity that includes a Phase II memorandum, our Adviser conducts rigorous in-house analytics, including a comprehensive analysis of market and operational dynamics as well as historical and projected financial information. Specific attention is given to management and sponsor experience and track record, industry dynamics, revenue growth drivers and valuations and general macroeconomic conditions. Additionally, background checks on company management teams are completed prior to an investment. Our Adviser, typically in conjunction with the control equity investor, often will engage a consultant to interview a range of key customers, suppliers, competitors and other parties deemed relevant to the ongoing performance of the target company. The consultant will typically prepare a report that generally includes a quality of earnings report, a market study and information technology and environmental

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 assessments. Finally, in reviewing each anticipated investment, investment professionals of our Adviser will conduct visits to the target companys headquarters and potentially auxiliary sites (e.g. factories, distribution centers, international locations). 
 Issuance of Formal Commitment.  Once we have determined that a potential transaction is suitable for investment, we work with the management and/or sponsor of the target company and its other capital providers, including senior, junior and equity capital providers, if any, to finalize the structure of the investment. We expect that approximately 2% to 4% of the investments initially reviewed by us eventually result in the issuance of formal commitments. 
 We expect our debt investments to typically have a term of five to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. We expect the average investment holding period to be between three and five years, depending upon portfolio company objectives and conditions in the capital markets. 
 Ongoing Relationship with and Monitoring of Portfolio Companies.  Our Adviser employs rigorous portfolio monitoring of portfolio companies following an investment. The monitoring process is driven by frequent interaction and discussion with target company management, attending operating meetings and board of director meetings, interacting with industry experts and third party sources for market information and working with third-party consultants. Our Adviser works with management and other investors to develop and continually refine the companys strategic plan as well as to monitor and evaluate the effects of macro-level industry factors. Additionally, our Adviser receives and analyzes monthly financial data and operating metrics and maintains an active database of historical company information. Finally, our Adviser performs regular detailed portfolio valuation analyses and monitors current and future liquidity needs and covenant compliance. 
 Managerial Assistance.  As a BDC, we offer, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. Our Adviser or an affiliate of our Adviser will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. We may receive fees for these services and will reimburse our Adviser or an affiliate of our Adviser for its allocated costs in providing such assistance, subject to the review by our board of directors, including our independent directors.
SBIC License  We have applied for a license to form a small business investment company subsidiary, or SBIC subsidiary; however, the application is subject to approval by the SBA and we can make no assurances that the SBA will approve our application. The SBIC subsidiary would be allowed to issue SBA-guaranteed debentures up to a maximum of $150 million under current SBIC regulations, subject to required capitalization of the SBIC subsidiary and other requirements. SBA guaranteed debentures generally have longer maturities and lower interest rates than other forms of debt that may be available to us, and we believe therefore would represent an attractive source of debt capital. See Risk Factors  Risks Relating to our Business and Structure  If we receive qualification from the SBA to be licensed as an SBIC but we are unable to comply with SBA regulations after the SBIC subsidiary is licensed as an SBIC, our business plan and investment objective could be adversely affected. 
 Determination of Net Asset Value 
 The net asset value per share of our outstanding shares of common stock is determined quarterly by dividing the value of total assets minus total liabilities by the total number of shares outstanding. 
 In calculating the value of our total assets, investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses will be computed using the specific identification method. Investments for which market quotations are readily available will be valued at such market quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market price is not readily available will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors based on the input of our management and audit committee. In addition, our board of directors will retain one or more independent valuation firms to review the valuation of each portfolio investment for which a market quotation is not available at least quarterly. We also have adopted ASC 820, which requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is assumed to be sold in the principal market to market participants, or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, the market in which we can exit portfolio investments with the greatest volume and level of activity is considered our principal market. 
 The valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter. Our board of directors has authorized the engagement of independent valuation firms to provide us with valuation assistance. We have independent valuation firms provide us with valuation assistance on a portion of our portfolio on a quarterly basis and our entire portfolio will be reviewed at least annually by independent valuation firms; however, our board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. When an external event with respect to one of our portfolio companies, such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we expect to use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation. As part of our quarterly valuation process, we will record an expense accrual relating to the capital gains component of the incentive fee payable by us to Alcentra NY when the unrealized gains on our investments exceed all realized capital losses on our investments given the fact that a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to Alcentra NY if we were to liquidate our investment portfolio at such time. The actual incentive fee payable to Alcentra NY related to capital gains will be determined and payable in arrears at the end of each fiscal year and will include only realized capital gains for the period computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation for such period. 
 A readily available market value is not expected to exist for substantially all of the investments in our portfolio, and we will value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors under our valuation policy and process. The types of factors that our board of directors may take into account in determining the fair value of our investments generally include, as appropriate, comparisons of financial ratios of the portfolio companies that issued such private equity securities to peer companies that are public, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio companys ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and other relevant factors. 
 When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the company will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different from the valuations currently assigned. See Item 1.A. Risk Factors  Risks Relating to our Investments  Price declines and illiquidity in the corporate debt markets may adversely affect the fair value of our portfolio investments, reducing our net asset value through increased net unrealized depreciation. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
 
 | our quarterly valuation process will begin with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | preliminary valuation conclusions will then be documented and discussed with our senior management and our Adviser;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the audit committee of our board of directors will then review these preliminary valuations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | at least once quarterly, independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors will prepare preliminary valuations on a selected basis and submit the reports to us; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the board of directors will then discuss valuations and determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of our Adviser, the independent valuation firm and the audit committee.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Determinations in Connection with Offerings 
 In connection with offerings of shares of our common stock, our board of directors or an authorized committee thereof will be required to make the determination that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price below the then current net asset value, or NAV, of our common stock at the time at which the sale is made. Our board of directors or an authorized committee thereof will consider the following factors, among others, in making such determination: 

 | the NAV of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report that we filed with the SEC;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our managements assessment of whether any material change in the NAV of our common stock has occurred (including through the realization of gains on the sale of our portfolio securities) during the period beginning on the date of the most recently disclosed NAV of our common stock and ending two days prior to the date of the sale of our common stock; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the magnitude of the difference between (i) a value that our board of directors or a committee thereof has determined reflects the current NAV of our common stock, which is generally based upon the NAV of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report that we filed with the SEC, as adjusted to reflect our managements assessment of any material change in the NAV of our common stock since the date of the most recently disclosed NAV of our common stock, and (ii) the current offering price of our common stock.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These processes and procedures are part of our compliance policies and procedures. Records will be made contemporaneously with all determinations described in this section and these records will be maintained with other records that we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act. 
 Certain Relationships 
 Policies and Procedures for Managing Conflicts; Co-investment Opportunities 
 We have entered into agreements with our Adviser, in which our senior management and members of our Advisers Investment Committee have indirect ownership and other financial interests. Our Adviser may in the future manage other investment funds, accounts or investment vehicles that invest or may invest in assets eligible for purchase by us. To the extent that we compete with entities managed by our Adviser or any of its affiliates for a particular investment opportunity, our Adviser will allocate investment opportunities across the entities for which such opportunities are appropriate, consistent with (a) its internal investment allocation policies, (b) the requirements of the Advisers Act, and (c) certain restrictions under the 1940 Act regarding co-investments with affiliates. See the section entitled Item 1.A. Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Business and Structure  There are significant potential conflicts of interest that could negatively affect our investment returns. 
 The 1940 Act prohibits us from making certain negotiated co-investments with affiliates unless we receive an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. In the absence of receiving exemptive relief from the SEC that would permit greater flexibility relating to these kinds of co-investments, our Adviser will determine whether these kinds of potential negotiated investments are more appropriate for us or for one of the funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates and which entity will proceed with the investment. We generally will not make an investment in any company in which any fund managed by our Adviser holds an investment in a different class of such companys debt or equity securities or obligations unless we also acquire or own the same class of such companys debt or equity securities as such fund managed by our Adviser or our Adviser determines that (a) the investment is in our best interests and (b)(i) the possibility of a conflict between the interests of such different classes is remote, (ii) either the potential investment by us or the investment of such other fund managed by our Adviser is not large enough to control any actions taken by the collective holders of securities of such company, or (iii) in light of the particular circumstances, our Adviser believes such investment is appropriate for us, notwithstanding the potential for conflict. 
 On December 30, 2015, the SEC granted us relief sought in an exemptive application that expands our ability to co-invest in portfolio companies with other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with certain conditions. Under the 

11



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 terms of the order, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching with respect to us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our then-current objectives and strategies. 
 See also Item 1.A. Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Business and Structure  There are significant potential conflicts of interest that could negatively affect our investment returns and  The incentive fee structure we have with our Adviser may create incentives that are not fully aligned with the interests of our stockholders for the risks related to our incentive fee structure. 
 Investment Advisory Agreement 
 We have entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with our Adviser. Pursuant to this agreement, we have agreed to pay to our Adviser a base management fee and incentive fee. Mr. Echausse is an interested member of our board of directors and has a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in our Adviser. See Item 1. Business  Investment Advisory Agreement. The incentive fee is computed and paid on income that we may not have yet received in cash at the time of payment. This fee structure may create an incentive for our Adviser to invest in certain types of speculative securities. Additionally, we rely on investment professionals from our Adviser to assist our board of directors with the valuation of our portfolio investments. Our Advisers base management fee and incentive fee is based on the value of our investments and, therefore, there may be a conflict of interest when personnel of our Adviser are involved in the valuation process for our portfolio investments. 
License Agreement 
 We have entered into a License Agreement with our Adviser pursuant to which our Adviser has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Alcentra. See Item 1. Business  License Agreement. 
 Relationship with BNY Mellon Group 
 Conflicts of interest may arise between the BNY Mellon Group, on the one hand, and us, on the other hand. We are an affiliate of BNY Mellon. BNY Mellon Group is a leading provider of financial services for institutions, corporations and high-net-worth individuals, providing asset management and wealth management, asset servicing, issuer services, clearing services and treasury services through a worldwide client-focused team. We may benefit from the relationships and activities resulting from these services. However, situations will arise in which the interests of BNY Mellon Group will conflict with our interests and the interests of our stockholders. 
 Transactions with the BNY Mellon Group 
 BNY Mellon Group may, but is not required to, extend credit to us under credit facilities, derivative instruments or otherwise. The interest of BNY Mellon Group as a creditor of us may conflict with the interests of our investors. BNY Mellon Group, with respect to any such extension of credit, will deal with us on an arms-length basis and will be entitled to exercise its rights as a creditor of us without regard to any potential impact therefrom on the interests of our investors. 
 BNY Mellon Group currently owns or operates, directly or indirectly, several registered investment advisers, registered investment companies, broker-dealers and service providers, or, collectively, the BNYM Affiliates. To the extent permitted by law, BNY Mellon and/or one or more of the BNYM Affiliates may provide us; our Adviser; Alcentra Middle Market; one or more investments funds or accounts or similar investment vehicles that BNY Mellon Group provides advice to or manages or that may in the future provide advice to or manage as a result of acquiring or merging with an entity that owns or manages such vehicles, or, collectively, the Related Funds; and our portfolio companies with certain non-investment management services and facilities, including, without limitation, administrative, custodial, trustee, distribution, banking, lending, short-term credit, and other financial and securities services. Specifically, BNY Mellon Group may provide administrative, custodial and credit facilities to us. 

12



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Neither BNY Mellon Group nor any of the BNYM Affiliates providing these services and facilities to us, our Adviser, Alcentra Middle Market and/or Related Funds, bear any responsibility for selecting the investments of such entities or for their performance. BNY Mellon Group or the BNYM Affiliates may charge arms length fees to our Adviser to the extent they perform any services that are included in the operating expenses of our Adviser. Additionally, BNY Mellon Group may recommend to its clients and to our investors that they invest some of their assets in us and Related Funds and may have financial interests in promoting investment in such entities. 
 To the extent permitted by applicable law and our governing documents, we may enter into transactions and invest in futures, securities, currencies, swaps, options, forward contracts or other instruments in which a BNY Mellon Group entity acts as a principal or, on a proprietary basis for its customers, serves as the counterparty. 
 Competing Funds and Allocation Policies 
 Certain Related Funds may in the future have investment objectives and utilize strategies similar to or that overlap with our investment objective and strategies. In such instances our Adviser will be permitted to allocate, in its sole discretion, eligible investments and exit opportunities between such investment funds (and their successors) on the one hand and us on the other hand in a manner it deems equitable to the extent possible under the prevailing facts and circumstances considering various factors including those set out in the paragraph below. 
 Conflicts (and potential conflicts) may arise when we are competing with the Related Funds for investment opportunities and exits. To address these potential conflicts, our Adviser has developed allocation policies and procedures that provide that personnel of our Adviser making portfolio decisions for us and the Related Funds will make purchase and sale decisions and allocate investment opportunities among us and the Related Funds consistent with its fiduciary obligations. To the extent permitted by applicable law, these policies and procedures may result in the pro rata allocation of limited opportunities across us and the Related Funds. However, in many other cases the investment opportunities will be allocated based on other factors. Related Funds managed by different portfolio management teams are generally viewed separately for allocation purposes. There will be cases where certain Related Funds may receive an allocation of an investment opportunity when we do not and vice versa. 
 Our Advisers investment allocation policy further provides that allocations among us and other eligible accounts will generally be made in accordance with SEC interpretive positions. Our Adviser seeks to treat all clients fairly and equitably in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duty to each of them; however, in some instances, especially in instances of limited liquidity, the factors may not result in pro rata allocations or may result in situations where certain accounts receive allocations where others do not. 
 In addition, we, or any of our portfolio companies, Related Funds, and/or one or more of their affiliates may have relationships with, invest in, engage in transactions with, make voting decisions with respect to, and/or obtain services from, entities for which BNY Mellon Group performs or seeks to perform services or with which BNY Mellon Group engages in or seeks to engage in transactions. Such relationships may provide our Adviser with an incentive to allocate, directly or indirectly, investments to certain of the funds managed by BNY Mellon Group and not others. 
 Fees From Services to Portfolio Companies 
 BNY Mellon Group may receive significant advisory, underwriting, or other fees from portfolio companies. Services for advisory fees may range from general corporate financial advice to restructuring advice to merger and acquisition representation. For example, BNY Mellon Group may be compensated as an advisor to a person who sold an investment to us, BNY Mellon Group may earn fees for obtaining equity or debt financing for an investor attempting to consummate an acquisition in which we are a co-investor, or BNY Mellon Group may earn fees acting as a lender, advisor or underwriter to one of our portfolio companies. None of the fees paid to BNY Mellon Group or its affiliates will be shared with us.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Regulated Investor 
 As a result of restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and entities managed by bank holding companies (including us), our Adviser, through Alcentra Middle Market, may be required or may decide to structure an investment in a manner that would be less favorable to us than structures available to a non-regulated entity. Consequently, our Adviser may choose a structure which may be less favorable to us than other structures. In addition, we may be restricted from making an investment or limited in the amount or may be required to divest an investment as a result of such restriction. See Item 1.A. Risk Factors  Risks Relating to our Business and Structure  Our activities may be limited as a result of being controlled by a bank holding company. 
 BNY Mellon has put in place policies and procedures to seek to manage and mitigate the potential conflicts of interests described above. 
 Competition 
 Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle-market companies include public and private funds, other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to maintain our qualification as a RIC. 
 We use the expertise of the investment professionals of our Adviser to which we have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, the relationships of the investment professionals of our Adviser enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle-market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see Item 1.A. Risk Factors  Risks Relating to our Business and Structure  We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses. 
 Employees 
 We do not have any direct employees, and our day-to-day investment operations are managed by our Adviser and each of our executive officers is an employee of the Adviser. To the extent necessary, our board of directors may hire additional personnel going forward. Our officers are employees of our Adviser and our allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Accounting Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs will be paid by us pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
Investment Advisory Agreement 
 Alcentra NY serves as our investment adviser and is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors and in accordance with the 1940 Act, our Adviser manages our day-to-day operations and provide investment advisory services to us. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser:

 | determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | executes, closes, services and monitors the investments we make;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | determines the securities and other assets that we purchase, retain or sell;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies; and

 | provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay our Adviser a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components  a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee will ultimately be borne by our stockholders. Our Adviser agreed to waive its fees (base management and incentive fee), without recourse against or reimbursement by us, through the quarter ended June 30, 2015 to the extent required in order for us to earn a quarterly net investment income to maintain a targeted dividend payment on shares of common stock outstanding on the relevant dividend payment dates of 9.0% (to be paid on a quarterly basis). 
 Management Fee 
 The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate as follows: 1.75% of our gross assets (i.e., total assets held before deduction of any liabilities), including assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage and excluding cash and cash equivalents (such as investments in U.S. Treasury Bills), if our gross assets are below $625 million; 1.625% of our total gross assets if our gross assets are between $625 million and $750 million; and 1.5% of our total gross assets if our assets are greater than $750 million. These various management fee percentages (i.e. 1.75%, 1.625% and 1.5%) would apply to our entire gross assets in the event our gross assets exceed the various gross asset thresholds. For example, if our gross assets were $800 million, we would pay the Adviser a management fee of 1.5% on the entire $800 million of gross assets. Although we do not anticipate making significant investments in derivative financial instruments, the fair value of any such investments, which will equal their current market value, not their notional value, will be included in our calculation of gross assets. For services rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents (such as investments in U.S. Treasury Bills), at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately pro-rated. 
Incentive Fee 
 We pay our Adviser an incentive fee. Incentive fees are calculated as below and payable quarterly in arrears. The incentive fee, which provides the Adviser with a share of the income that it generates for us, has two components, ordinary income and capital gains, calculated as follows: 
 The ordinary income component is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a total return requirement and deferral of non-cash amounts, and is 20.0% of the amount, if any, by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets attributable to our common stock, for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, exceeds a 2.0% hurdle rate or preferred return and a catch-up provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter. Under this provision, in any calendar quarter, our Adviser receives no incentive fee until our pre-incentive fee net investment income equals the hurdle rate or preferred return of 2.0%, but then receives, as a catch-up, 50% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate or preferred return but is less than 2.5%. Our adviser receives 20% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.5%. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income (including on our investments in U.S. Treasury Bills), dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence, managerial assistance and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, administrative expenses payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, and any interest expense and any distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee and any offering expenses and other expenses not charged to operations but excluding certain reversals to the extent such reversals have the effect of reducing previously paid incentive fees based on the deferral of non-cash interest). Pre-incentive fee net investment income excludes, in the case of investments with a 

15



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income until we have received such income in cash. 
 The foregoing incentive fee is subject to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of our pre-incentive fee net investment income is payable except to the extent 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding quarters exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding quarters. In other words, any ordinary income incentive fee that is payable in a calendar quarter is limited to the lesser of (i) 20.0% of the amount by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the 2.0% hurdle, subject to the catch-up provision, and (ii) (x) 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters minus (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding calendar quarters. For the foregoing purpose, the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations is the amount, if positive, of the sum of pre-incentive fee net investment income, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation for our then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters. In addition, the portion of such incentive fee that is attributable to deferred interest (such as PIK interest or OID) is paid to the Adviser, without any interest thereon, only if and to the extent we actually receive such interest in cash, and any accrual thereof will be reversed if and to the extent such interest is reversed in connection with any write-off or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to any deferred interest accrual. Any reversal of such accounts would reduce net income for the quarter by the net amount of the reversal (after taking into account the reversal of incentive fees payable) and would result in a reduction and possible elimination of the incentive fees for such quarter. There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate or preferred return from quarter to quarter, and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle, and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle. 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss, subject to the total return requirement and deferral of non-cash amounts. For example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate or preferred return, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. Our net investment income used to calculate this component of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 1.75% base management fee. These calculations will be appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter. 
 The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee: 
 Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Net Investment Income Pre-incentive Fee Net Investment Income (expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) 

Percentage of Pre-incentive Fee Net Investment Income Allocated to Income-Related Portion of Incentive Fee
The capital gains component of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), commencing on December 31, 2014, and is equal to 20.0% of our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains from inception through the end of that calendar year, computed net of our aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and our aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation through the end of such year, less 

16



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. If such amount is negative, then no capital gains incentive fee will be payable for such year. Additionally, if the Investment Advisory Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date will be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying the capital gains incentive fee. 
Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation 
 Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee: 
 Alternative 1 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25%
 Hurdle rate or preferred return(1) = 2.0%
 Management fee(2) = 0.4375%
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20%
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income
 (investment income  (management fee + other expenses) = 0.6125% 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate or preferred return, therefore there is no income-related incentive fee. 
 Alternative 2 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.9%
 Hurdle rate or preferred return(1) = 2.0%
 Management fee(2) = 0.4375%
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20%
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income
 (investment income - (management fee + other expenses) = 2.2625%


Incentive fee | =50% × Pre-incentive fee net investment income (subject to catch-up)(4)
 | =50% × (2.2625% - 2.0%) 
 | =0.13125% 

 Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, but does not fully satisfy the catch-up provision, therefore the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.2625%. 
 Alternative 3 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.5%
 Hurdle rate or preferred return(1) = 2.0%
 Management fee(2) = 0.4375%
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20%
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income
 (investment income  (management fee + other expenses) = 2.8625%


Incentive fee | =50% × Pre-incentive fee net investment income (subject to catch-up)(4) 
Incentive fee | =50% × catch-up + (20% × (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income - 2.5%))
Catch-up | =2.5% - 2.0% 
 | =0.5% 


Incentive fee | =(50% × 0.5%) + (20% × (2.8625% - 2.5%))
 | =0.25% + (20% × 0.3625%) 
 | =0.25% + 0.0725% 
 | =0.3225%

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate or preferred return, and fully satisfies the catch-up provision, therefore the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.5725%. 

(1) | Represents 8.0% annualized hurdle rate.
----+----------------------------------------


(2) | Represents 1.75% annualized base management fee. For purposes of these examples, we have assumed the maximum amount of Base Management Fees that may be paid, or 1.75% of our gross assets.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Excludes organizational and offering expenses.
----+-----------------------------------------------


(4) | The catch-up provision is intended to provide our Adviser with an incentive fee of 20% on all pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate or a preferred return did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any fiscal quarter.

Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee(*): 
 Alternative 1: 
 Assumptions 
 Year 1: $2.0 million investment made in Company A (Investment A), and $3.0 million investment made in Company B (Investment B) 
 Year 2: Investment A sold for $5.0 million and fair market value (FMV) of Investment B determined to be $3.5 million 
 Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $2.0 million 
 Year 4: Investment B sold for $3.25 million 
 The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be: 
 Year 1: None 
 Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $0.6 million  ($3.0 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20%) 
 Year 3: None  $0.4 million (20% multiplied by ($3.0 million cumulative capital gains less $1.0 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $0.6 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2) 
 Year 4: Capital gains incentive fee of $50,000  $0.65 million ($3.25 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20%) less $0.6 million (capital gains incentive fee taken in Year 2) 
 Alternative 2 
 Assumptions 
 Year 1: $2.0 million investment made in Company A (Investment A), $5.25 million investment made in Company B (Investment B) and $4.5 million investment made in Company C (Investment C) 
 Year 2: Investment A sold for $4.5 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $4.75 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $4.5 million

 Year 4: $0.05 million capital gains incentive fee  $0.7 million ($3.50 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20%) less $0.65 million cumulative capital gains incentive fee paid in Year 2 and Year 3 
 Year 5: None  $0.45 million (20% multiplied by $2.25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $3.5 million less realized capital losses of $1.25 million)) less $0.7 million cumulative capital gains incentive fee paid in Year 2, Year 3 and Year 4(2)

(1) | As illustrated in Year 3 of Alternative 1 above, if a portfolio company were to be wound up on a date other than its fiscal year end of any year, it may have paid aggregate capital gains incentive fees that are more than the amount of such fees that would be payable if such portfolio company had been wound up on its fiscal year end of such year.

(2) | As noted above, it is possible that the cumulative aggregate capital gains fee received by our Adviser ($0.70 million) is effectively greater than $0.45 million (20% of cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less net realized capital losses or net unrealized depreciation ($2.25 million)).

 Administrative Services 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser furnishes us with office facilities and equipment and provides us with clerical, recordkeeping and other administrative services at such facilities. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser also provides managerial assistance on our behalf to those portfolio companies that have accepted our offer to provide such assistance. 
 Payments under the Investment Advisory Agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion (subject to the review of our board of directors) of our Advisers overhead in performing its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement, including rent and the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions. In addition, if requested to provide significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, our Adviser will be paid an additional amount based on the services provided, which shall not exceed the amount we receive from such portfolio companies for providing this assistance. 
 Duration and Termination 
 Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will continue in effect for a period of two years from its effective date. It will remain in effect from year to year thereafter if approved annually by our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and, in either case, if also approved by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The Investment Advisory Agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, by our Adviser and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days written notice to the other. The holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities may also terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement without penalty upon 60 days written notice. See Item 1.A. Risk Factors  Risks Relating to our Business and Structure  We are dependent upon key personnel of our Adviser and the Alcentra Group for our future success. If our Adviser or the Alcentra Group were to lose any of its key personnel, our ability to achieve our investment objective could be significantly harmed. 
Indemnification 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members, and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our Advisers services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser. 
 Organization of the Investment Adviser 
 Alcentra NY is a Delaware limited liability company. The principal executive offices of Alcentra NY are located at 200 Park Avenue, 7th Floor, New York, New York 10166. 
 Board Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement 
 At an in-person meeting of the board of directors held on March 9, 2017, the board of directors re-approved the Investment Advisory Agreement for a one-year term. 
 In approving the renewal of the investment advisory agreement, our board of directors, including a majority of our non-interested directors, made the following determinations: 
 
 | Nature, extent and quality of services. Our board of directors received and considered information regarding the nature, extent and quality of the investment selection process employed by Alcentra NY. Our board of directors also considered the backgrounds and responsibilities of Alcentra NYs senior personnel and their qualifications and experience in connection with the types of investments made by us, as well as Alcentra NYs financial resources. Our board of directors determined that the nature, extent and quality of the services provided or to be provided by Alcentra NY supported the renewal of the investment advisory agreement.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 | Investment Performance. Our board of directors considered the investment performance of Alcentra NY, as well as comparative data with respect to the investment performance of other externally-managed business development companies. Our board of directors considered, among other things, the performance of our common stock and changes in our net asset value in comparison with other business development companies. Our board of directors concluded that Alcentra NYs investment performance supported the renewal of the investment advisory agreement. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Reasonableness of advisory fees. Our board of directors considered comparative data based on publicly available information on other business development companies with respect to the advisory fees (including the management fees and incentive fees) of other business development companies. Based upon its review, our board of directors concluded that the fee schedule is comparable with the fee schedules of business development companies with similar investment objectives. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Economies of Scale. Our board of directors addressed the potential for Alcentra NY to realize economies of scale in managing our assets, and determined that at this time they did not expect economies of scale to be realized by Alcentra NY. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Based on the information reviewed and the discussions, the board of directors, including a majority of the non-interested directors, concluded that the investment management fee rates and terms are reasonable in relation to the services to be provided and approved the Investment Advisory Agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders. 
 Administration Agreement 
 Under the Administration Agreement, State Street provides us with financial reporting, post-trade compliance, and treasury services. In providing these services, State Street oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial and other records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports and other materials filed with the SEC. State Street provides post-trade compliance services including performing the applicable SEC, IRS, and BDC compliance testing, provide monthly and quarterly reporting and maintain a compliance testing matrix and perform an annual update. In addition, State Street assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of our tax return, the printing and dissemination of reports and other materials to our stockholders and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. 
 Payments under the administration agreement equal a fixed annual fee, paid in monthly installments in arrears, along with additional fees and expenses as incurred each month. Under the Administration Agreement, we reimburse State Street for out-of-pocket expenses incurred on our behalf for services, as well as direct pass-through vendor fees incurred on our behalf.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Regulation 
 We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and to be treated as a RIC under the Code. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between business development companies and their affiliates (including any investment advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a business development company unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 
 We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an underwriter as that term is defined in the Securities Act. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. However, we may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also may not acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. None of these policies is fundamental and may be changed without stockholder approval upon 60 days prior written notice to stockholders. 
 Qualifying Assets 
 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the companys total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our proposed business are the following: 

(1) | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the Company) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfies either of the following:
--+-----------------------------------


º | has a market capitalization of less than $250 million or does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


º | is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC, the BDC actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result thereof, the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


22



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
(3) | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The regulations defining qualifying assets may change over time. We may adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area. 
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
 In addition, a business development company must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described above in Qualifying Assets categories 1, 2 or 3. Business development companies generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the business development company controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the business development company purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers, employees or agents, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. Our Adviser will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. 
Temporary Investments 
 Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets or temporary investments. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, so long as the agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the Diversification Tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 
Senior Securities 
 We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Item 1.A. Risk Factors  Risks Relating to our Business and Structure  Regulations governing our operation as a BDC will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Codes of Ethics 
 We and our Adviser have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with such codes requirements. You may read and copy our code of ethics at the SECs Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (202) 551-8090. In addition, our code of ethics is attached as an exhibit to our registration statement on Form N-2 (file number 333-199622) filed on January 14, 2015, and is available on the EDGAR Database on the SECs website at www.sec.gov. You may also obtain copies of our code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following e-mail address: publicinfo@sec.gov, or by writing the SECs Public Reference Section, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. 
 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of our Adviser are set out below. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by our Adviser and our directors who are not interested persons, and, accordingly, are subject to change. 
 As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, our Adviser has a fiduciary duty to act solely in our best interests. As part of this duty, our Adviser recognizes that it must vote our securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in our best interests. 
 Our Advisers policies and procedures for voting proxies for its investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 
 Proxy Policies 
 Our Adviser votes proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what it perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders. Our Adviser reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its effect on the portfolio securities we hold. In most cases our Adviser will vote in favor of proposals that our Adviser believes are likely to increase the value of the portfolio securities we hold. Although our Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative effect on our portfolio securities, our Adviser may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. 
 Our Adviser has established a proxy voting committee and adopted proxy voting guidelines and related procedures. The proxy voting committee establishes proxy voting guidelines and procedures, oversees the internal proxy voting process, and reviews proxy voting issues. To ensure that our Advisers vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, our Adviser requires that (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how our Adviser intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. Where conflicts of interest may be present, our Adviser will disclose such conflicts to us, including our independent directors and may request guidance from us on how to vote such proxies. 
 Proxy Voting Records 
 You may obtain information about how our Adviser voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Alcentra Capital Corporation, 200 Park Avenue, 7th Floor, New York, New York 10166, or by telephone at (212) 922-8240. 
 Privacy Principles 
 We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their nonpublic personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 

24



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Generally, we do not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain nonpublic personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third-party administrator). 
 We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to employees of our Adviser and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our stockholders. 
 Other 
 We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such persons office. 
 We and our Adviser are each required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of relevant federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 
 We are also prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our board of directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. The SEC has interpreted the BDC prohibition on transactions with affiliates to prohibit all joint transactions between entities that share a common investment adviser. The staff of the SEC has granted no-action relief permitting purchases of a single class of privately placed securities provided that the adviser negotiates no term other than price and certain other conditions are met. As a result, we only expect to co-invest on a concurrent basis with investment funds, accounts or investment vehicles managed by our Adviser when each of us and such investment fund, account or investment vehicle will own the same securities of the issuer and when no term is negotiated other than price. Any such investment would be made, subject to compliance with existing regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and our allocation procedures. If opportunities arise that would otherwise be appropriate for us and for an investment fund, account or investment vehicle managed by our Adviser to invest in different securities of the same issuer, our Adviser will need to decide which fund will proceed with the investment. Moreover, except in certain circumstances, we will be unable to invest in any issuer in which an investment fund, account or investment vehicle managed by our Adviser has previously invested. 
 On December 30, 2015, the SEC granted us relief sought in an exemptive application that expands our ability to co-invest in portfolio companies with other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with certain conditions. Under the terms of the order, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching with respect to us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our then-current objectives and strategies. We intend to co-invest, subject to the conditions included in the order. 
 Our Status as an Emerging Growth Company 
 We are an emerging growth company, or EGC, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act. An EGC is defined as a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion in its most recently completed fiscal year. An EGC will retain such status until the earlier of: (1) the fifth anniversary of the date it first sold securities pursuant to an initial public offering registration statement; 

25



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which it first exceeds $1 billion in annual gross revenues; (3) the time it becomes a large accelerated filer (an SEC registered company with a public float of at least $700 million); or (4) the date on which the EGC has, within the previous three years, issued $1 billion of nonconvertible debt. 
 The JOBS Act affords an EGC an opportunity to get a temporary reprieve from certain SEC regulations by exempting an EGC from these regulations for up to five years. These eased requirements include an exemption from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements and relaxed restrictions on the sale of securities. The JOBS Act provides scaled disclosure provisions for EGCs, including, among other things, removing the requirement that EGCs comply with Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b) auditor attestation of internal control over financial reporting. 
 Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act also permits an EGC to elect an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until such time as these new or revised standards are made applicable to all private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us since our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 
 Compliance with NASDAQ Global Select Market Listing Requirements 
 Our shares of common stock are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ABDC. As a listed company on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, we are subject to various listing standards, including corporate governance listing standards. We will monitor our compliance with all listing standards and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 
 Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:
 
 | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pursuant to Item 307 under Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compliance with the Bank Holding Company Act 
 BNY Mellon is a bank holding company, or a BHC under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or the BHCA. BNY Mellon is also a financial holding company, or FHC, under the BHCA, which is a status available to BHCs that meet certain criteria. As a BHC and a FHC, the activities of BNY Mellon and its affiliates are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the BHCA and related regulations. BHCs and FHCs are subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve. Because BNY Mellon may be deemed to control us within the meaning of the BHCA, restrictions under the BHCA could apply to us. Accordingly, the BHCA and other applicable banking laws, rules, regulations and guidelines, and their interpretation and administration by the appropriate regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the Federal Reserve, may restrict the transactions and relationships between our Adviser, BNY Mellon and their 

26



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 affiliates, on the one hand, and us on the other hand, and may restrict our investments, transactions and operations. For example, the BHCA regulations applicable to BNY Mellon and us may, among other things, restrict our ability to make certain investments or the size of certain investments, impose a maximum holding period on some or all of our investments, and restrict our Advisers ability to participate in the management and operations of the companies in which we invest. In addition, certain BHCA regulations may require aggregation of the positions owned, held or controlled by related entities. Thus, in certain circumstances, positions held by BNY Mellon and its affiliates (including our Adviser) for client and proprietary accounts may need to be aggregated with positions held by us. In this case, where BHCA regulations impose a cap on the amount of a position that may be held, BNY Mellon may utilize available capacity to make investments for its proprietary accounts or for the accounts of other clients, which may require us to limit and/or liquidate certain investments. Additionally, BNY Mellon may in the future, in its sole discretion and without notice to investors, engage in activities impacting us and/or our Adviser in order to comply with the BHCA or other legal requirements applicable to, or reduce or eliminate the impact or applicability of any bank regulatory or other restrictions on BNY Mellon, us or other funds and accounts managed by our Adviser and its affiliates. See Item 1.A. Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure  Our activities may be limited as a result of being controlled by a bank holding company. 
Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code effective as of our taxable year ended December 31, 2014, and qualify annually thereafter. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to maintain our status of a RIC we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, which generally is our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the Annual Distribution Requirement). 
 Election to be Taxed as a RIC 
 As a BDC, we have elected to be treated effective as of our taxable year ended December 31, 2014, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, which generally is our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the Annual Distribution Requirement). 
 Taxation as a RIC 
 For any taxable year in which we: 
 
 | qualify as a RIC; and
--+----------------------


 | satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement,
--+---------------------------------------------

 we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 
 We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no corporate-level U.S. federal income tax (the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement). We generally will endeavor in each taxable year to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to avoid any U.S. federal excise tax on our earnings.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 
 
 | continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain qualified publicly traded partnerships, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities (the 90% Income Test); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain qualified publicly traded partnerships (the Diversification Tests).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Qualified earnings may exclude such income as management fees received in connection with our SBIC subsidiaries or other potential outside managed funds and certain other fees. 
 In accordance with certain applicable Treasury regulations and private letter rulings issued by the IRS, a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many stockholders elect to receive cash, each stockholder electing to receive cash must receive a pro rata amount of cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any stockholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than 20% of his or her entire distribution in cash. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these Treasury regulations or private letter rulings. 
 We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest, deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock, or certain income with respect to equity investments in foreign corporations. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 
 Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. 
 Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain asset coverage tests are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating

 to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If we are prohibited from making distributions or are unable to obtain cash from other sources to make the distributions, we may fail to qualify as a RIC, which would result in us becoming subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. 
 In addition, we will be partially dependent on our SBIC subsidiaries for cash distributions to enable us to meet the RIC distribution requirements. Our SBIC subsidiaries may be limited by the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, and SBA regulations governing SBICs, from making certain distributions to us that may be necessary to maintain our status as a RIC. We may have to request a waiver of the SBAs restrictions for our SBIC subsidiaries to make certain distributions to maintain our RIC status. We cannot assure you that the SBA will grant such waiver. If our SBIC subsidiaries are unable to obtain a waiver, compliance with the SBA regulations may cause us to fail to qualify as a RIC, which would result in us becoming subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. 
 The remainder of this discussion assumes that we qualify as a RIC and have satisfied the Annual Distribution Requirement. 
 Any transactions in options, futures contracts, constructive sales, hedging, straddle, conversion or similar transactions, and forward contracts will be subject to special tax rules, the effect of which may be to accelerate income to us, defer losses, cause adjustments to the holding periods of our investments, convert long-term capital gains into short-term capital gains, convert short-term capital losses into long-term capital losses or have other tax consequences. These rules could affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to stockholders. We do not currently intend to engage in these types of transactions. 
 A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its investment company taxable income (which is, generally, ordinary income plus net realized short-term capital gains in excess of net realized long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed gross taxable income (e.g., as the result of large amounts of equity-based compensation), we would experience a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, we may for tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such required distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, you may receive a larger capital gain distribution than you would have received in the absence of such transactions. 
 Investment income received from sources within foreign countries, or capital gains earned by investing in securities of foreign issuers, may be subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source. In this regard, withholding tax rates in countries with which the United States does not have a tax treaty are often as high as 35% or more. The United States has entered into tax treaties with many foreign countries that may entitle us to a reduced rate of tax or exemption from tax on this related income and gains. The effective rate of foreign tax cannot be determined at this time since the amount of our assets to be invested within various countries is not now known. We do not anticipate being eligible for the special election that allows a RIC to treat foreign income taxes paid by such RIC as paid by its stockholders. 
 If we acquire stock in certain foreign corporations that receive at least 75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such as interest, dividends, rents, royalties or capital gain) or hold at least 50% of their total assets in investments producing such passive income (passive foreign investment companies), we could be subject to U.S. federal income tax and additional interest charges on excess distributions received from such companies or gain from the sale of stock in such companies, even if all income or gain actually received by us is timely distributed to our stockholders. We would not be able to pass through to our stockholders any credit or deduction for such a tax. Certain elections may, if available, ameliorate these adverse tax consequences, but any such election requires us to recognize taxable income or gain without the concurrent receipt of cash. We intend to limit and/or manage our holdings in passive foreign investment companies to minimize our tax liability.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Foreign exchange gains and losses realized by us in connection with certain transactions involving non-dollar debt securities, certain foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency option contracts, foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currencies, or payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency are subject to Code provisions that generally treat such gains and losses as ordinary income and losses and may affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to our stockholders. Any such transactions that are not directly related to our investment in securities (possibly including speculative currency positions or currency derivatives not used for hedging purposes) could, under future Treasury regulations, produce income not among the types of qualifying income from which a RIC must derive at least 90% of its annual gross income. 
Failure to Qualify as a Regulated Investment Company 
 If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions are applicable (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes or to dispose of certain assets). 
 If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and the foregoing relief provisions are not applicable, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. Distributions would not be required, and any distributions would be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and, subject to certain limitations, may be eligible for the 20% maximum rate for noncorporate taxpayers provided certain holding period and other requirements were met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholders tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. To requalify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the nonqualifying year, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized within the subsequent five years, unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level tax on such built-in gain at the time of our requalification as a RIC.
