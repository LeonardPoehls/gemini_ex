     ITEM 1.             
Overview
     UQM Technologies, Inc., (“UQM”, “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) develops, manufactures and sells power dense, high efficiency electric motors, generators, power electronic controllers and fuel cell compressors for the commercial truck, bus, automotive, marine, and industrial markets. Our primary focus is incorporating our advanced technology as propulsion systems for electric, hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric and fuel cell electric vehicles, delivering the heart of the electric vehicle. 
     We believe our proprietary permanent magnet propulsion motor and motor control technology delivers exceptional performance at a competitive cost. Our principal products include propulsion motors and generators with power ratings from 50 kilowatts to 250 kilowatts, auxiliary motors and electronic controls and DC-to-DC converters. The principal attributes that we believe differentiate our proprietary products are compact size, high torque delivery, high power density (the ratio of power output to weight), design and manufacture of integrated motor/controller systems, and superior energy efficiency with full system ratings as high as 95%.
     Our management team has significant experience in the automotive and electric propulsion industry with critical experience in state-of-the-art design and high quality production.  We are ISO/TS 16949 certified, the highest level of quality certification in the automotive supplier industry, and ISO 14001 certified, the highest environmental standards.  We have an approximately 130,000 square foot combined headquarters and manufacturing facility located in Longmont, Colorado.  We were incorporated in 1967 as a Colorado corporation.
     In August 2017, we entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement (“Agreement”) with China National Heavy Duty Truck Group Co., Ltd. through its wholly owned subsidiary, Sinotruk (BVI) Limited (collectively, “CNHTC”), the parent company of Sinotruk (Hong Kong) Limited (“Sinotruk”), a leading Chinese commercial vehicle manufacturer, and also announced that UQM and CNHTC plan to create a joint venture (“JV”) to manufacture and sell electric propulsion systems for commercial vehicles and other vehicles in China.  CNHTC has headquarters in Jinan, China.  CNHTC’s investment is expected to occur in two stages.  First, CNHTC will acquire newly issued common shares of UQM, resulting in a 9.9% ownership interest of common shares issued and outstanding. This stage was completed on September 25, 2017, with net proceeds to UQM of $5.1 million. Second, CNHTC will acquire additional newly issued common shares resulting in CNHTC owning a total of 34% of UQM’s issued and outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis.  The purchase price is $0.95 per share for each stage, which represents a 15% premium over the 30-day closing price average for the period ending on the last trading date before the execution date of the Agreement. If completed, the total transaction will bring approximately $28.3 million in cash to UQM.   The terms of the Agreement were unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies.  UQM shareholders will continue to hold their shares in UQM, and UQM stock will continue to be traded on the NYSE American.
         Closing of the second stage investment is subject to certain closing conditions, including the approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) under Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, as it would result in a material investment by a foreign-controlled entity in UQM.  On March 5, 2018, we announced that UQM, along with CNHTC, have decided to withdraw their joint application to CFIUS for the approval of the second stage investment provided.  Based upon the request of CFIUS, the application has been withdrawn to allow

for more time to consider modifications to the business relationship of UQM and CNHTC that CFIUS would find acceptable.  Upon completion of this re-evaluation, both parties intend to resubmit the application to CFIUS for approval.
     The Market
     The global electrified vehicle market is an emerging market with high growth potential being driven by several factors. In China, the market for electric vehicles is driven by strong government pressure to deal with the environmental concerns in its major cities.  The government has a number of initiatives to encourage electric vehicle market growth including mandates for purchases of New Energy Vehicles by municipalities, incentives and other tools.  We are seeing strong demand for electric buses across several cities and regions.  We are also seeing demand for electric buses, delivery vans, trucks and taxi fleets across several cities and regions in China.  As China is the world’s largest market for electric vehicles, we believe that our presence in China is critical to our long-term success.  Therefore, we continue to devote significant time and resources to business development efforts in China, including the new relationship with CNHTC.
     In other global markets, including the United States, the drivers for growth in the electric commercial truck and bus market include the demand for zero tailpipe emissions from full electric vehicles or during the electric only range for hybrids, improved operating costs due to a more efficient powertrain on a gas equivalent basis and reduced maintenance costs for the powertrain system and other systems, such as improved brake life.  Moreover, there is community support for cleaner buses and trucks operating in congested areas, along with government incentives and requirements to purchase electric and hybrid vehicles.  In the automotive market, these same growth drivers exist, as well as growing consumer acceptance of electric vehicles due to their excellent performance, quiet operation, zero or reduced tailpipe emissions and improved operating cost. In addition, significant Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards in the United States are expected to accelerate further electrification of vehicle fleets. 
     Many studies have been conducted indicating the potential growth for electric vehicles over the next several years.  For example, Morgan Stanley Research has forecasted that almost 20 million electric vehicles will be sold by 2025, as shown in the chart below:
    
     There are several economic drivers that support this anticipated growth of electric vehicles.  First, and perhaps most important, battery costs, which comprise the single largest component cost in any electric vehicle, have declined dramatically.  In 2010, the cost per kW- hour of a lithium-ion battery was about $1,000; in 2015, this cost had fallen to about $200, and is projected to continue to fall.  This decline in battery costs has spurred higher demand.  Second, published studies have shown that ownership costs of electric vehicles are significantly lower than diesel powered vehicles.  A diesel bus, for example, has a range of four miles per gallon; an electric bus has the equivalent of twenty-one miles per gallon.  Third, maintenance costs of electric vehicles are significantly lower than diesel powered vehicles.

The same studies showed that a diesel bus costs about one dollar per mile to maintain; the maintenance cost for an electric bus was about six cents per mile.  All of these economic benefits are helping to drive the market for electric vehicles.
     Governments around the world have implemented financial incentives to promote the sales of electric vehicles.  For example, the U.S. federal government currently offers a $7,500 federal tax credit for the purchase of an electric passenger vehicle, and there are additional tax credits and other benefits such as HOV lane access in various states for purchasers of qualifying vehicles.  In China, beginning on January 1, 2017, subsidies for electric buses varied depending on the efficiency performance of the vehicle, and could reach a maximum subsidy of $120,000 per bus.  This bodes well for the use of our propulsion systems since they are highly efficient. In Europe, a majority of European Union member states provide tax incentives for electrically chargeable passenger vehicles, with Norway providing the most generous package of subsidies totaling almost EUR 17,000 (approximately $19,000).  The government of India has announced its desire that plug-in vehicles would represent 30 percent of new sales by 2030.
     We believe that the trend toward increasing electrification of vehicles coupled with the government subsidies offered world-wide and lower battery and vehicle operating costs provide a substantial opportunity for the broad commercial application of our products.
     Business Strategy
     We are focused primarily on the transportation markets, with a strong emphasis on the commercial truck and bus space, followed by automotive and then marine, and other applications. We have developed two basic frame size propulsion systems: the PowerPhase® Pro for passenger car, light commercial applications, light duty marine and other lighter duty applications and the PowerPhase® HD lineup of products for heavier commercial bus and truck applications and heavier duty marine and other applications.  In 2016, we introduced the PowerPhase® DT, a full electric drivetrain including the motor, inverter, transmission and transmission control unit.  We also utilize these products, customized versions of these products and all new custom solutions in these markets to meet various customer requirements.  We provide motor and controller systems for full-electric, hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid and fuel cell applications.  We also provide units for non-automotive markets including auxiliary systems and motor and controller systems for aircraft.   Further, we manufacture fuel cell compressor systems for the fuel cell business.

      Product Development Activities 
     We continue to develop new variations of our product lineup to meet expanding customer requirements and work on custom solutions for new prospective customers meeting their precise specifications.  We are also developing the next generation of PowerPhase Pro® and PowerPhaseHD® products designed to be smaller, lighter weight, more energy efficient and producible at lower cost with equal or better performance than our current PowerPhase systems. The resulting products from this development effort are expected to launch in the next two years. Development targets include a substantial size and cost reduction of the motor controllers.  Adopting new generation components and control strategies are also elements of this development.  Target applications include automotive and light commercial truck, medium and heavy-duty truck, and bus, markets.
     In September, 2016, we completed our work on an advanced motor design technology that eliminates the need for rare-earth elements in the magnets. The technology incorporates permanent magnets of an alternate chemistry, arranged in a unique way that maintains performance benefits. A patent has been awarded to protect this innovation. We had a $4.0 million program with the Department of Energy (“DOE”) to develop non-rare-earth magnet electric motors for use in electric and hybrid vehicles. The DOE provided $3.0 million of funding for this program and the Company provided $1.0 million of cost-share contribution.   This award was announced in August 2011. 
     In January 2017, we announced a development agreement with Meritor, Inc. to jointly develop and supply full electric axle systems (E-axles) targeting the medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicle market.  This next-generation technology could accelerate market demand over the next few years due to improved component packaging, lower costs from integration, and increased vehicle performance.

 Excess Inventory
     We re-evaluated the carrying value of the PowerPhase Pro®   inventory  during 2016 and as of December 31, 2016.  A key factor in our analysis during the nine months ended December 31, 2016 was that in October of 2016, our customer ITL had informed us of their intention to purchase in cash a significant portion of the PowerPhase Pro® inventory, which did not happen.  Because of the long delays in this customer’s product launch and the lack of a significant cash payment towards this inventory, we determined that, out of a total of $7.6 million, approximately $6.8 million of this inventory should be reserved as excess inventory and we took a charge for this amount against this inventory as of December 31, 2016.  At that time, we had purchase orders from existing customers to acquire the remaining balance of the PowerPhase Pro® inventory. We also reserved approximately $350,000 for other obsolete inventory as of December 31, 2016.  As of December 31, 2017, no additional reserve was required.      Competition
     All of the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and are characterized by changes due to technological advances that could render existing technologies and products obsolete, although we are not currently aware of any such advances that could render our current product portfolio obsolete.  We believe our competitors are large automotive OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers to OEMs, Chinese electric motor manufacturers offering lower cost options, and numerous other competitors in nearly every region of the world.
     As a result, additional vehicle makers in both on-road and off-road markets are expected to develop and introduce a variety of hybrid electric and all-electric vehicles as market acceptance of these vehicles continues to grow. We cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully in this market or any other market that now exists or may develop in the future. There are numerous companies developing products that do or soon will compete with our systems. Some of these companies possess significantly greater financial, personnel and other resources than we do, including established supply arrangements, volume manufacturing operations and access to governmental incentive programs. 
     Customers and Suppliers
     We derive our revenue from the following sources: 1) the sale of products designed, engineered and manufactured by us primarily to OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers of OEMs, and vehicle integrators; 2) funded contract research and development services performed for strategic partners, customers, and in the past from the U.S. government, directed toward either the advancement of our proprietary technology portfolio or the application of our proprietary technology to customers’ products; and 3) after-market services and remanufacture. 
     Our business is subject to revenue fluctuation based on the buying cycles of our customers.  Specific customers that reach 10% or more of revenues in any given fiscal quarter or year will also vary depending on these buying cycles.  In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, two customers individually comprised 10% or more of our total revenues.  Any loss of business with these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
     Principal raw materials and components purchased by us include iron, steel, electronic components, rare-earth magnets and copper wire. Most of these items are available from several suppliers. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, one supplier comprised 10% or more of our total purchases.  Certain components used by us are custom designs and if our current supplier no longer made them available to us, we could experience production delays.
     We can experience significant price fluctuation in the cost of magnets used in our motors, which contain the rare-earth elements neodymium and dysprosium and are primarily sourced from China. We have not experienced any disruption in supply of magnets, and magnet prices may continue to be volatile until mining operations outside of China increase or restart.

 Financial Information about Geographic Areas  
     The following summarizes total revenue by geographic area:
    
 | Year ended December 31, | | Nine months ended December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016 
United States | $ | 4,009,941 | | $ | 3,101,153
Foreign Countries | | 3,768,808 | | | 1,021,842
 | $ | 7,778,749 | | $ | 4,122,995

      Classification of geographic area is determined based upon the country where the purchase transaction originated.
     U.S. Government Contracts 
     We had a $4.0 million program with the DOE to develop non-rare-earth magnet electric motors for use in electric and hybrid vehicles. This grant ended in September 2016. The DOE provided $3.0 million of funding for this program and the Company provided $1.0 million of cost-share contribution. The objective of the program was to identify and evaluate magnet materials and technology that can deliver performance comparable to our rare-earth magnet motors, broaden our product portfolio, potentially lower magnet costs and limit our exposure to price and supply concerns associated with rare-earth magnets.  We have been granted a U.S. patent for our electric and hybrid electric vehicle motor design using non-rare earth magnets.     Backlog 
     Our order backlog for products at January 31, 2018 was approximately $2.4 million versus $4.9 million at January 31, 2017. Certain orders are blanket purchase orders which are subject to the issuance of subsequent release orders directing the number and timing of actual deliveries. We had backlog of service contracts from customers, which will provide future revenue upon completion, totaling approximately $200,000 at January 31, 2018 versus $0 at January 31, 2017. Substantially all of the backlog amounts at January 31, 2018 and 2017 are subject to amendment, modification or cancellation.  We expect to ship motor and controller backlog products over the next twelve months.     Intellectual Property 
     We have numerous patents in the United States and in other countries to protect our intellectual property.
     We determine if our intellectual property should be treated as a trade secret or submitted to the patent application process by deciding whether a technology successfully passes through three evaluation gates.  The first gate is an assessment of whether the expected breadth of the patent would offer a high level of protection or whether it will serve as an educational tool for competitors.  Based upon a patent and literature search, if the expected coverage is broad, the evaluation moves to the second gate, which is an assessment of infringement detection.  This is a review of whether or not it will be possible to detect patent infringement if a competitor were to adopt the technology.  Difficulty in detection reduces the value of a patent and will lead us to handle the technology as a trade secret rather than a patent.  The last gate is an assessment of whether the technology will have value for many years or whether the technology is a stepping stone to a different technology.  The patent process is a multi-year endeavor from the initial disclosure to the granted patent, which leads to the importance of this gate.  A technology that is expected to have value for five or more years will pass the final gate and the patent application process will then commence.
     We also implement measures to protect our intellectual property, including the guarding and protection of source code, nondisclosure of control techniques, and protection of product design details, drawings and documentation.
     Trademarks
     We have registered the letters "UQM" in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Counterpart applications have been filed in numerous countries throughout the world, most of which have granted registrations or indicated them to be allowable. We own three U.S. Trademark Registrations for "UQM" (International Class 7 for power transducers, Class 12 for utility land vehicles, and Class 16 for publications). The foreign trademark registrations and applications include major markets where we are doing business or establishing business contacts.

     We have also registered the trademark "POWERPHASE" which we use in conjunction with certain of our propulsion systems. The trademark is registered in the European Community and several other foreign countries. 
    
Employee and Labor Relations 
     As of January 31, 2018, we had 51 employees, all of whom are full-time employees. We have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers.  The employment agreements expire on December 31, 2019.  We believe our relationship with employees has been generally satisfactory.
     In addition to our full-time staff, we from time to time engage the services of outside consultants and contract employees to meet peak workload or specialized program requirements. We do not anticipate any difficulty in locating additional qualified engineers, technicians and production workers, if so required, to meet expanded research and development or manufacturing operations.
