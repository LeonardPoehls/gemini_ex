ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
ABP was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 31, 2016, at which time it acquired the hair-care formula that its business is based upon. The Company believes this formula can be used to develop at least six distinct beauty products. As of June 22, 2018, we had one employee, our founder and president, Barbara Chardi and four outside consultants. From March 31, 2016 (date of inception) through March 31, 2018, Ms. Chardi on average has devoted a minimum of fifteen (15) hours per week as necessary for business operations, product research and product development. As of the date of this Report we believe Ms. Chardi will continue to provide these services at no cost to the Company. Ms. Chardi will devote as much time as necessary as we near product launch. The four consultants we work with, assist Ms. Chardi in the R&D efforts, as well as the marketing and sales efforts for the Company’s products. The outside consultants provide their services on an as-needed basis and work directly for various businesses based in San Diego, California. These services could be easily replaced with the services of others in the industry depending on our ability to achieve the necessary financing.
 
The Company issued 5,500,000 shares of its common stock to Ms. Chardi in exchange for organizational services incurred upon incorporation. (See “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions”, and Note 1 to the Company’s financial statements.) We received the product formula soon thereafter for which we did not pay any consideration. The Allegro Organics formula when combined with other all-natural ingredients provides a multitude of product possibilities, each of which we believe will share key ingredients. Based on initial research, testing and development, we believe our proprietary formula already lends itself to six different products. From here, we hope to grow the number of products stemming from the same product formulation. Formula mixtures will be the foundation for cleansers, conditioners, toners, and styling creams, all of which are the core of our intended product offerings.
 
ABP is a development stage company and has no financial resources. We have not established or attempted to establish a source of equity or debt financing. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in their report emphasizing the uncertainty of our ability to remain a going concern.
 
As of March 31, 2018, we had limited assets which consist of cash ($4,986), prepaid expenses ($74) and fixed assets, net of depreciation ($287), totaling $5,347. We expect to increase the overall amount of our assets in the next few months as we further develop our product line with capital investment in inventory as well as fixed assets such as machinery for production and packaging. In order to fund the development of our new hair-care business and to meet working capital needs over the next 12 months, we will attempt to secure funding from the sale of common stock or debt financing through third-party investors, distributors and/or manufactures involved in the natural hair-care industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any funds or that such funds will be offered on terms acceptable to us.
 
We are developing a line of all-natural, organic hair-care products based on our Allegro Organics formula. Our operations commenced due to the efforts of our founder as well as funding from sources associated with our founder. Our founder and president, Ms. Chardi, has limited professional and industry experience in developing hair-care products. As such, it is our goal to re-imagine the Allegro Organics formula amidst numerous and readily available natural ingredients to develop products with the help of independent contractors. After our initial products are fully developed and ready for market, we will seek to arrange for them to be manufactured by third-party manufacturers that focus on all-natural and organic products. We do not intend to self-manufacture our products. We will identify, through Ms. Chardi and others in the hair-care business, manufacturers that may be willing to engage in the manufacture and packaging of our hair-care products through a single-source manufacturing agreement or through contract manufacturing. Additionally we shall seek the assistance of certain product designers or consultants to develop the packaging for our products. We anticipate that our line of hair-care products will consist of six separate products, available for sale to the retail market sometime in late 2018 although no assurances can be given that we will achieve or come close to achieving this goal. 
 
The sale of our products will depend on our ability to obtain sufficient financing as well as completing the development, product formulation and the manufacturing and fulfillment of our hair-care collection. Products will initially consist of a line of cleansers (all-natural shampoo), smoothing and straightening conditioners, hair and follicle thickening formula, follicle healing pomade, and hair and scalp serums specific to gender, with a hint of scent and colors appeasing to both genders. We initially identified a handful of local all-natural organic product distributors and one international distributor that may be willing to offer our hair-care products through their distribution channels when our products become available, although no firm commitments have been made as of yet. 
 
While we have been fully engaged, our business operations and discussions pertaining to manufacturing, fulfillment, sales and marketing have generally been limited to the solicitation of advice and direction from industry professionals. Any discussions that we may have or may have had cannot be assumed to develop into a firm or even an oral agreement for services until we have completed our offering and pursued other financing sources and alternatives. Our intent is to continue these discussions with independent consultants, manufacturers, distributors, and other industry professionals, beyond just information sharing.

In order to further our plan of operations, we will need to secure additional financing of between $50,000 and $100,000 before the second half of 2018. If we are not successful in securing this capital, we will not be able to proceed with our business plan as contemplated. Our plan of operations requires us to establish additional sources of capital to fulfill our operational requirements. These funds will go towards the development, production and finished goods completion of products for the commercial market to ultimately generate sufficient sales. Alongside the further development of our product line, we will continue to pursue additional sources of financing and attempt to establish a public market for our common stock, which may then allow us to seek financing from sources that would not be available to us if we were private. Accordingly, we may be able to negotiate from strength in pursuing financing or agreements with vendors, manufacturers, and capital sources. We cannot predict the likelihood or timing of any success from our intended actions. 
 
The Company has no current plans to be acquired or to merge with any other entity; nor does the Company or any of its shareholders have any plans to enter into a change of control or such similar transactions.
 
Business 
 
Our goal is to develop an all-natural, organics hair-care business based on a series of all-natural, organic-based hair-care products marketed under our proposed “Allegro Organics” brand name. Our goal is to develop, manufacture and market a line of quality hair-care products emphasizing an organic, all-natural character for each and every product within the collection. Our business plan contemplates the sale of the Company’s products as all-natural, organic, Whole Foods-like products, primarily through natural food and retail stores, specialty organic and all-natural focused retailers, specialty kiosks, vendors and distributors and with substantial market traction in mainstream retailers, made up of grocery, druggist and other department store retailers. In addition, we would eventually seek to expand distribution channels by offering products for sale through a sophisticated website, online retailers specializing in organic and all-natural products, health websites, specialty retailers, as well as through established ecommerce operations.
 
We intend to use independent professionals to gain introduction to target markets to initiate and grow a consumer following. Our target market will consist of consumers seeking an all-natural product with restorative effects for both their hair and scalp. We have not entered into contracts with nor approached any industry or marketing consultants. We currently have no sources of financing nor commitments for financing. There are no assurances we will obtain sufficient financing or resources to enter into beneficial agreements with contractors, manufacturers, distributors or marketing firms within the industry.
 
Products 
 
We are developing a line of organic, all-natural hair-care products. We retained a product formulator for the purpose of assisting in our development of product formulations incorporating a proprietary complex blend of sixteen different raw materials, the foundation for each product we intend to develop. High quality raw materials are necessary in the formulation of our products. The types of raw materials we intend to use in our products include natural waxes, butters, oils, emulsifiers, essential oils, natural preservatives, juices, and naturally derived vitamins such as Vitamin E and Vitamin C. Some of these materials contain anti-oxidant properties that are believed to help fight free radical damage caused by sunlight, stress and other environmental factors. Other ingredients have been selected for their efficacy in helping to correct existing hair damage and age-related signs (such as dryness, breakage, brittleness, hair firmness and poor elasticity). Our goal is to develop a hair-care line that uses all-natural, renewable ingredients, which distinguishes our unique hair-care products from brands that rely on petrochemical and/or undesirable man-made ingredients. 
 
Utilizing organic materials in our products will have a negligible effect on business costs while having a significant beneficial impact on the overall image of the product line and the corresponding marketability of the products. While organic ingredients are slightly more expensive and quality and consistency may vary, we believe that the organic and all natural makeup of our formulations is worth the extra cost. The average consumer actively seeks out all natural, organic derived consumables, such as hair-care products, and are likely willing to pay more for organic products. We currently source our product ingredients from a number of suppliers. These raw materials are widely available and have no geographic or international limitations on their availability. We do not believe that we will have any issues with obtaining ingredients from suppliers or the availability of ingredients needed for our products.
 
Our discussions with our product formulator, have been limited, and we currently do not have a legally binding or any other formal agreement with either them. We engage them on an as-needed basis and they bill us accordingly. When an agreement is reached, we believe it will provide for professional consulting services billed either monthly or weekly. The product formulator has samples of our intended products and works with Ms. Chardi to develop other recipes and formulations into saleable consumer products. Consistency and control over the quality of our products are essential to a successful entrance into the hair-care market. We cannot predict the likelihood of entering into an acceptable contractual arrangement with them or any independent product formulator. However, we believe we can easily replace them if we need to. In fact, we have recently been approached by several other industry professionals in our efforts to grow our business operations.

Based on information provided to us by the product formulator and Ms. Chardi, we hope to have completed formulation and development for the initial hair-care products by mid-fall of 2018 (i.e. October 2018). This will enable us to commence testing of products before manufacturing begins. Testing we believe will be conducted by any contract manufacturer we engage. We intend to test all of our products for safety and in compliance with the Personal Care Products Council (formerly the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association) standards, a self-regulatory organization for the cosmetics and beauty-care industry. Several batteries of tests will be conducted, including product safety, preservative efficacy, product and package stability, and assay testing for all of our products. Testing stability involves a three-month period where analysts track changes in viscosity (thickness), appearance and odor at various temperatures to determine shelf life, expiry dates, and other items. It is our intent to engage a contract manufacturer to perform these tests. We may not be able to contract with a manufacturer willing and able to provide these services at a reasonable price. If we are not able to contract with a manufacturer, we will pursue the necessary testing on a per-piece basis using a specialist in the field, and limit our manufacture of products on a small scale. This may not necessarily fulfill our needs for commercial sales, but at least this will provide us with product that would be available for sale through very limited channels. 
 
As we plan to sell our products over the counter only, we do not anticipate needing or obtaining United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or other regulatory approvals. We do not plan on performing any clinical testing of any kind. Any products containing sun protection factor (“SPF”) or any other non-over the counter ingredients, however, would need to meet stringent FDA testing regulations and global standards for sales in countries other than the United States. We do not anticipate having products that contain SPF in our product line.
 
Our goal is to offer a broad range of hair-care products that address hair-care needs for the consumer. Our intended products include cleansers, various conditioners, thickening formulas, pomades, and hair serums, and other all-natural organic products, a number of which will be specifically developed for use on various parts of the head, hair (follicle, shaft, strand), the dermis and epidermis layers of the scalp, and just the ‘roots’. The product formulator and Ms. Chardi are creating hair-care products for the Company based on the Allegro Organic formula:
 


Allegro Organics – All-natural hair cleanser 
 

Allegro Organics – All-natural hair revitalizer 
 

Allegro Organics – All-natural hair and scalp purifying cleanser 
 

Allegro Organics – All-natural head and scalp toner 
 

Allegro Organics – All-natural head and scalp serum 
 

Allegro Organics – All-natural thinning hair and scalp repair cream 
 
Contract Manufacturing 
 
We do not intend to manufacture products in our own facilities. Rather, we intend to outsource manufacturing to one or more independent manufacturers that manufacture other all-natural or organic lines (preferably hair-care). A contract manufacturer will be required to test our products during manufacturing and conduct quality control in all aspects of their manufacturing process. During testing, we may make further changes to our product formulation, thereby requiring batch control and testing for both quality and control. While we believe we may be able to engage a contract manufacturer to perform these functions, we may not be able to do so without great costs. As discussed above (in Products), we may modify our plan of operations in a manner consistent with our given financial situation at critical junctures. 
 
Once the given formula is finalized for each product, the selected or engaged manufacturer will produce an agreed upon number of units and bottle and package the product units for us. We have begun the process of choosing peripheral items involved in the manufacturing and marketing process, which include:
 


Shape and size of product containers; 
 

Types of caps or lids, with a focus on ease of use; 
 

Packaging and packaging materials, that are natural as well, recyclable; 
 

Logo and label designs; and 
 

Unit packaging, storage, delivery and palletizing standards. 
 
We currently have no arrangements, informal or otherwise, with any contract manufacturer to produce the Allegro Hair-Care Collection.

Marketing and Distribution
 
We intend to seek a distribution arrangement with an organic and all-natural product retailer in the U.S. for the initial sale of our products. We intend to pursue international distribution and exclusive relationships with a slant on organics and all-natural offerings. These efforts will be undertaken with the assistance of proven marketing professionals. We currently have no arrangements with any marketing professional; however, we have had discussions with regional, national and international distributors of consumer goods and products that are open to representing ABP’s products. Product samples will be provided to these various distributors and the Company will, through the services of Ms. Chardi and its product formulator, seek feedback from these distributors regarding interest in carrying ABP’s products, placement terms and pricing, initial anticipated order quantities, packaging and labeling. 
 
We anticipate completing our first production run during late 2018, provided we obtain the necessary capital. There are no assurances we will be successful in obtaining financing or completing the development of our products within this timeframe or otherwise.
 
Competition
 
The hair-care business and the all-natural organic product business in general, is highly competitive. We will compete with hundreds of small, medium and large sized business entities, including but not limited to multi-national manufacturers and highly specialized organic product companies. Many of our competitors’ products are well known and trusted by the consumer. Virtually all of our competitors have greater financial and operational resources than we do. Our competitors have the ability to spend more aggressively on advertising and marketing, spend more on product development and testing, and have more flexibility than we do to respond to changing business and market conditions. Some of our competitors are able to survive on the strength of their brand name alone. When they introduce a new product to the marketplace, whether it be hair-care or another beauty product, consumers are not so wary to try the new product as they would be with us. Competition in the hair-care business is based on pricing, quality, innovation, perceived value, promotional activities, advertising, product introductions, name recognition, and a host of other factors. It is difficult for us to predict how we will be able to compete with our competitors in these areas.
 
We believe through the efforts of outside marketing and advertising professionals, we can prepare effective marketing and consumer-directed materials that will inform consumers of the benefits our products when fully developed, assuming we have the financial resources to engage these professionals. We produced samples of our intended products for consumer testing and have received positive results. The results and responses to date have been from a small sample of consumers in a non-scientific manner. These results although anecdotal have driven us to improve upon the product formulas and pursue a retail market for these products when ready. Anecdotal marketing through these consumers through their friends and family members has generated a strong but small product demand. Even without a retail product available, we have received requests to manufacture the products for use. 
 
We will compete using our internal and external contacts to develop business opportunities, and to meet with potential distributors and distribution channel managers, with whom we may attempt to partner despite our limited resources. These opportunities we believe will come from contacts and referrals, our product formulator’s contacts and referrals, as well as other industry professionals with their contacts and referrals. The availability of these business opportunities will depend upon our ability to secure sufficient funding for product development, manufacturing, and sales, marketing and advertising efforts. We cannot predict the likelihood or timing for our success. 
No assurances can be given that our competitive strategy will have any success. 
 
Intellectual Property 
 
We have no patent or trademark applications pending. 

 
Government Regulation and Industry Standards
 
While we believe our business is not subject to material regulation under the laws of the United States or any states in which we plan to sell our hair-care products, laws and regulations often differ materially between states. Such laws and regulations are subject to amendment and interpretation by the agencies charged with their enforcement. If we become subject to any licensing or regulatory requirements, the failure to comply with any such requirements could lead to a revocation, suspension or loss of licensing status, termination of contracts and legal and administrative enforcement actions. We cannot be sure that a review of our current and proposed operations will not result in a determination that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, regulatory requirements are subject to change from time to time and may in the future become more restrictive, thereby making compliance more difficult or expensive and otherwise affect or restrict our ability to conduct our business as now conducted or proposed to be conducted.

Employees
 
As of June 22, 2018, we had one employee, our founder and president, Barbara Chardi. From March 31, 2016 (date of inception) through March 31, 2018, Ms. Chardi has continuously devoted a minimum of fifteen (15) hours per week as necessary for the business and its operations. We believe that Ms. Chardi will continue to provide her services at no cost to the Company. We have no current plans to compensate Ms. Chardi for her efforts. We intend to use independent contractors and other outside consultants to assist Ms. Chardi in our business on an as needed basis pending our resources. Even then, we may continue to principally rely upon Ms. Chardi and our current independent contractors for most of our development, technical and manufacturing needs.
 
There is no written employment contract or employment agreement with Ms. Chardi. We are not actively seeking employees, additional independent contractors or consultants through formal contracts or agreements. This may change in the event that we are able to secure adequate financing through equity or loans. 
 
Property
 
Our office and mailing address is 2101 29th St., San Diego, California 92104. The space is provided to us at no cost by Ms. Chardi. The space is located in Ms. Chardi’s personal residence and management believes this space is sufficient for our current operations. Ms. Chardi incurs no incremental costs as a result of using the space. There is currently no written or oral agreement with Ms. Chardi to use this space.
Litigation 
 
We are not party to any pending, or to our knowledge, threatened litigation of any type.
