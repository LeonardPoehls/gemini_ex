Overview

 
NeuLion, Inc. (“NeuLion,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading technology product and service provider that specializes in the digital video broadcasting, distribution and monetization of live and on-demand content, with the mission to deliver and enable the highest quality video content experiences anywhere and on any device.  Our flagship solution, the NeuLion Digital Platform, is a complete end-to-end, cloud-based, fully integrated video solution that simplifies the digital video workflow and provides all the tools necessary for NeuLion’s customers to monetize their digital video content.
 
The NeuLion Digital Platform offers content owners and rights holders a highly configurable and scalable suite of digital technologies, together with services for back-end content preparation, management, marketing, monetization, secure delivery, real time analytics, and end user application development, in an end-to-end solution that addresses the complexities associated with successfully streaming and marketing their content.  Our solutions also include our NeuLion consumer electronics (“CE”) software development kit (the “CE SDK”), which allows CE manufacturers to provide a secure, high quality video experience with premium screen resolution, up to Ultra HD/4K, across virtually all content formats, for a wide range of connected devices.  Additionally, NeuLion offers a library of high quality video and audio compression-decompression programs, or codecs, that we license under the MainConcept brand.  Our codecs are used by leading technology companies to encode and decode audio and video files.
 
We primarily generate revenue by offering the NeuLion Digital Platform on a subscription basis comprised of a combination of fixed and variable fees.  Our revenue is generated from fees determined by the number of events and linear channels we stream and the number of connected devices we enable, as well as the volume of digital video content we deliver and/or the end user revenue generated by our customers.  We also generate revenue from licensing our NeuLion technologies, including our CE SDK to CE manufacturers and our MainConcept technologies to video solution developers and others.
 
We believe that the proliferation of Internet-connected devices, the increasing amount of digital video content, the growth in video consumption over broadband, particularly sports and entertainment content, on mobile and other connected devices and the demand for continually improving and personalizing viewing experiences will be the principal drivers of our growth.  As enterprises continue to struggle with the complexities of managing growing libraries of live and on-demand digital content, creating compelling branded user experiences and delivering those experiences across a wide range of connected devices in high-quality resolutions, our comprehensive suite of products and focus on innovation may allow us to increase revenues from existing customers and expand our customer base in the Americas, Europe, Asia and beyond.
 
 On March 26, 2018, NeuLion entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with WME Entertainment Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”) and Lion Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”).  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into NeuLion, with NeuLion surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Merger”).  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each of NeuLion’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock will be canceled and converted into the right to receive $0.84 in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes.  Prior to entering into the Merger Agreement, stockholders representing approximately 70%, in the aggregate, of NeuLion’s outstanding shares of common stock executed and delivered to NeuLion a written consent, effective upon the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, irrevocably approving and adopting the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.  The Merger cannot be consummated until the passing of 20 calendar days from the date on which NeuLion mails to its stockholders an information statement on Schedule 14C under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Each party’s obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
 
Also on March 26, 2018, NeuLion entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Stillwater Holding Company LLC pursuant to which NeuLion agreed to sell certain assets relating to its business of providing web publishing, ticketing and donor management services to athletic conferences, colleges and universities (collectively, the “Assets”). The sale of the Assets will close immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, and is conditioned solely upon the substantially concurrent closing of the Merger.  The Purchase Agreement automatically terminates upon a termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.


 On February 12, 2018, NeuLion completed the sale of certain DivX assets, intellectual property and foreign subsidiaries to an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group for total cash consideration of $41.5 million.

Products and Technology
 
NeuLion Digital Platform
 
NeuLion has developed its own proprietary end-to-end turnkey video distribution platform, called the NeuLion Digital Platform, that provides digital video broadcasting and distribution of live and on-demand sports and entertainment content to any connected device, and also enables the monetization of that content.  A flexible solution that spans the entire digital video workflow and supports the latest technologies, the NeuLion Digital Platform enables global content owners and rights holders to prepare, manage, market, monetize, deliver, monitor and build applications for their live and on-demand digital video content, up to Ultra HD/4K, with advanced interactive features.  The NeuLion Digital Platform powers the digital experience for leading brands around the world.
CE SDK
 
The CE SDK enables a rich experience for consumers with advanced playback, mobile to TV interactivity, total security, and live streaming up to 4K resolutions with HDR (High Dynamic Range) for smart TVs and other connected devices like set-top boxes and streaming media devices. The CE SDK delivers a better viewing experience for sports and entertainment content for Ultra HD/4K TVs.  The CE SDK Device Certification program enables CE manufacturers a testing program that delivers high quality and performance content services and technology for their devices. Licensees of the CE SDK receive a Certification Test Kit designed to verify features and performance.
 
MainConcept Technologies
 
MainConcept technologies are premier solutions for software developers who require codec support in their own application, service or local and cloud environment.  MainConcept codec solutions are engineered to deliver the highest audio and video quality, are highly compatible with a broad range of hardware devices and software applications, and offer easy and flexible integration options. MainConcept supports nearly every mainstream codec in the market.
 
Customers
 
We have enterprise customers in three broad categories:  content owners and rightsholders; CE manufacturers; and video integrators.  Relationships with our content owner and rightsholder customers, which include entertainment, professional sports (both leagues and teams), college sports (both schools and conferences) and broadcaster/operator customers, generally involve entering into software license, distribution and service agreements to provide end-to-end solutions for the delivery of their content.  We license our CE SDK technologies to CE manufacturers to enable their devices to deliver high quality, secure consumer video experiences.  Video integrators, such as enterprise software providers, license our MainConcept technologies to enable their software and hardware solutions with advanced video and audio content processing capabilities.
Customer Dependence
 
For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, no one customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the National Hockey League and LG Electronics accounted for 23% of revenues:  12% and 11%, respectively.
 
As at December 31, 2017, NBA Media Ventures (the “NBA”), Samsung Companies (“Samsung”) and World Surf League accounted for 36% of accounts receivable:  14%, 12% and 10%, respectively.  As at December 31, 2016, Samsung and World Surf League accounted for 28% of accounts receivable:  15% and 13%, respectively.

Our marketing activities are designed to build awareness of our solutions.  Our principal marketing programs include: participation in, and sponsorship of, trade shows and industry events; use of our website to provide information about us and our solutions; integrated digital marketing campaigns, including email, online advertising and webinars; and public relations, analyst relations and social media initiatives.
 
Competition
 
Despite the barriers to entry created by the sizable technology investment required to deliver and monetize live and on-demand interactive content to connected devices, the overall market for digital content publishing and delivery solutions is rapidly evolving and highly competitive.  Our competitors vary for each of our solutions and include companies that build, license and deploy digital video content management services such as BAMTECH, NBC Sports Group’s Playmaker division, Deltatre and Verizon Digital Media Services, point solution providers such as Brightcove, Kaltura, Ooyala and Adobe, and in-house technology teams.  We also see indirect competition from media technology companies, such as Hulu, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon, Facebook and sports/entertainment networks, who develop their own technologies internally and then license content rights from content producers for distribution and monetization on their platforms.  Our prospective customers who are content owners and rightsholders may elect to license and deliver their content via these types of third-party platforms or to build their own content delivery systems.  We also face competition from companies providing products similar to our CE SDK and MainConcept technologies, including digital rights management services offered by Microsoft, Verimatrix and Google.
 
We believe the principal factors on which we compete in our market include, and our competitive advantages are, the following:
 
  
· | Reduced enhancement, integration and innovation complexities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | Time to market;
--+----------------


· | Ability to drive new revenue opportunities;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | Provision of a combination of proprietary technology and operational services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Creation of meaningful experiences that engage, retain and grow viewers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Breadth and depth of product functionality;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | Superior customer service and customer engagement model;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | Innovation and responsiveness to new market trends; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | Integration with third-party applications and technologies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------


 
We believe we compete favorably on the basis of these factors due to our deep experience in the market, and our commitment to and investment in research and development as well as our ability to provide customers of any size with complete, proprietary, integrated turnkey solutions.
 
Our competitors may have access to other technology, financial resources and relationships not available to us, which may enable these competitors to offer products of greater interest to consumers, acquire content rights or provide their solutions at more competitive costs.  If we are not able to compete successfully in attracting new customers or lose existing customers, our results of operations could be harmed.
 
Seasonality
 
The revenue associated with our sports customers is seasonal because demand for such programming corresponds to the seasons of the sports for which we stream digital video content.  As the majority of our sports contracts contain a variable revenue share or usage component, our revenues have historically been the highest during the first and fourth quarters of the year due to most of our professional sports customers broadcasting the majority of their games during those quarters.  As we have further expanded into other streaming areas such as news and entertainment, and into international markets with more sports programming throughout the calendar year, the seasonal nature of our business has begun to decrease.
Intellectual Property
 
Our ability to protect our intellectual property is an important factor in the success and continued growth of our business.  We protect our intellectual property through trade secrets laws, patents, copyrights, trademarks and contracts.  Some of our technology relies upon third-party licensed intellectual property and open source software.
 
We have an active and robust intellectual property protection program.  We are committed to protecting our innovations and brands by filing patent and trademark applications in the United States and any other country that represents an important actual or potential commercial market.
 
In addition to the foregoing, we have established business procedures designed to maintain ownership and confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements and assignment-of-inventions agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business.  We continue to seek new ways to enhance protections over our proprietary information both in the U.S. and abroad.

Research and Development
 
Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development, as well as on our ability to continue to innovate and enhance our suite of technologies and solutions.
 
Our research and development costs primarily consist of wages and benefits for research and development department personnel, who are primarily located in China, Russia and the U.S.  Our research and development expenses were $19.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, $19.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 and $24.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.
 
Employees
 
As of March 27, 2018, we had 676 total employees, 167 of whom were full-time employees.  None of our employees is represented by a union or is party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have not experienced any work stoppages.  We believe we have good relations with our employees.
