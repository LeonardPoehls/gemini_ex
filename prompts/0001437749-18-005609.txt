Investment Banking
 
Our investment banking professionals provide capital raising services, mergers and acquisitions transaction services, and other strategic advisory services to corporate clients. Dedicated industry coverage groups concentrate on each of our four target industries, enabling our investment bankers to develop expertise in specific markets and to form close relationships with corporate executives, private equity investors, venture capitalists and other key industry participants. We offer our clients a high level of attention from senior personnel and have designed our organizational structure so that the investment bankers who are responsible for securing and maintaining client relationships also actively participate in providing transaction execution services to those clients.
 
We focus our efforts on small and middle-market companies in the following four growth industries: technology, healthcare, financial services and real estate. Our specialization in these areas has enabled us to develop recognized expertise and to cultivate extensive industry relationships. As a result, we have established our firm as a key advisor for our corporate clients, a trusted resource for institutional investors, and an effective investment manager for our asset management clients. We currently operate from our headquarters in San Francisco and from additional offices in New York, Boston, Chicago, West Palm Beach and the Atlanta and Minneapolis areas.
 
We provide our corporate clients with a wide variety of services, including strategic financial advice and capital raising solutions, sales and trading support, and equity research coverage. We provide institutional investors with capital markets intelligence and investment recommendations about individual equities that are not widely followed. We believe that our concentration on small and middle-market companies, as well as our broad range of product offerings, positions us as a leader in what has traditionally been an underserved, though high-growth, market.
 
The selection of our four target industries, the development of multiple products and services, and the establishment of our four revenue-producing business lines—investment banking, sales and trading, equity research and asset management—has created a diversified business model, especially when compared to that of our more specialized competitors. Over the years, we have been able to balance fluctuating revenue streams from our investment banking activities, asset management incentive fees and principal investments with more stable revenue streams from our sales and trading activities and asset management base fees. In addition, our target industries have historically performed, in certain respects, counter-cyclically to one another, allowing us to win business and generate revenues in various economic and capital markets environment.
 
By focusing consistently on our target industries, we have developed a comprehensive understanding of the unique challenges and demands involved in executing corporate finance and strategic advisory assignments in these sectors. A significant portion of our corporate finance revenues is earned from small- and mid-capitalization public companies, and the balance is earned from private companies. Some of our clients retain us for our advisory and capital raising capabilities during an accelerated growth phase as a private company and then continue to work with us through an initial public offering or sale of the company. We maintain exceptional client focus both during and following a transaction, leading to a true advisory relationship and a pattern of assisting companies with multiple transactions.
 
Corporate Finance
 
We assist our publicly traded and privately held corporate clients with capital raising activities, which include the underwriting of a wide range of equity and debt securities, including common, preferred and convertible securities. Our public equity underwriting capabilities include initial public offerings and follow-on offerings. We also arrange private investments in public equity (“PIPE”) transactions and privately negotiated, registered direct stock offerings on behalf of our publicly traded clients. For our privately held clients, we act as an agent in private placements of equity and debt securities. We typically place securities with our client base of institutional investors, private equity and venture capital funds and high-net-worth individuals.
 
Because our corporate clients are generally high-growth companies, they are frequently in need of new capital. Many of our client relationships develop early, when a client company is still privately held, in which case we may facilitate private placements of the company's securities. Our ability to structure innovative private offerings and to identify the likely buyers of such offerings makes us a valuable advisor for many small and middle-market companies, as does our industry specialization. Thereafter, if our client prepares for an initial public offering, we may be selected to serve as an underwriter of that offering and of any subsequent follow-on offerings. We expect that, while the environment for initial public offerings may not be consistently favorable in the future, we should be able to depend on follow-on offerings, at-the-market offerings, PIPEs, registered direct offerings and private placements to continue to generate corporate finance revenues.
 
Mergers and Acquisitions and Other Strategic Advisory
 
We work with corporate clients on a broad range of strategic matters, including mergers and acquisitions, divestitures and corporate restructurings, valuations of businesses and assets, and fairness opinions and special committee assignments. We provide our advice to senior executives and boards of directors of client companies in connection with transactions that are typically of significant strategic and financial importance to these companies. We believe that our success as a strategic advisor stems from our ability to structure and execute complex transactions that create long-term shareholder value. Because we serve a variety of corporate clients, from private companies in early stages of growth to mature businesses either publicly or privately held, the values of these transactions range in size.
 
Because of our focus on innovative and fast-growing companies, we are most often an advisor in company sale transactions, although we are taking steps to create equilibrium in our advisory business and expect, in addition, to increasingly represent corporate clients as buyers over time. We believe that our position as a lead manager or senior co-manager of public and private equity offerings will facilitate the growth of our mergers and acquisitions and strategic advisory businesses, as companies that have been issuers of securities become more mature and pursue acquisitions or other exit events for their investors.

Sales and Trading
 
Our sales and trading operation distributes our equity research product and communicates our investment recommendations to our institutional brokerage clients. In addition, our sales and trading staff executes securities trades on behalf of our institutional clients and markets the securities of companies for which we act as an underwriter.
 
We have established a broad institutional client base rooted in longstanding relationships, which have been developed through a consistent focus on the investment and trading objectives of our customers. Our sales and trading professionals work closely with our equity research staff to provide insight and differentiated investment advice to approximately 500 institutional clients nationwide.
 
We believe that our sales and trading clients turn to us for timely, informed investment advice. Our equity research features proprietary themes and actionable ideas about industries and companies that are not widely evaluated by many other research providers. Many peer firms focused on small- and mid-capitalization companies have shut down or have been purchased by larger firms over the past two decades, while several of the very largest investment banking firms have failed or consolidated. As a result, the amount of market-making activity, liquidity and research coverage for smaller companies has decreased significantly. However, we continue to commit sales and trading resources to these companies with the belief that institutional investors require and value such specialized knowledge and service.
 
Our sales and trading personnel are also central to our ability to market securities offerings and provide after-market support. Our capital markets group manages the syndication, marketing, execution and distribution of the securities offerings we manage. Our syndicate activities include coordinating the marketing and order-taking process for underwritten transactions and conducting after-market stabilization and initial market-making. Our syndicate staff is also responsible for developing and maintaining relationships with the syndicate departments of other investment banks.
 
Equity Research
 
Our research department is charged with developing proprietary investment themes, anticipating sector and cyclical changes, and producing action-oriented reports that will assist our clients with their investment decisions. Our analysts cultivate primary sources of information in order to refine their quantitative and qualitative assessments. Our objective is to provide institutional investors with a clear understanding of industry-specific and company-specific issues that can impact their portfolio returns.
 
Our equity research focuses on our four broad industries—technology, healthcare, financial services and real estate—and on the following sectors underlying each industry:
 

Technology • Communications Infrastructure • Cybersecurity • Data Management • Digital Media • Energy Technology • Industrial Technology • Internet • Software | Healthcare • Biotechnology • Healthcare Facilities • Healthcare Services • Medical Devices & Supplies • Specialty Pharmaceuticals | Financial Services • Alternative Asset Managers • Commercial Finance • Consumer Finance • Financial Processing & Outsourcing • Financial Technology • Insurance • Investment Banks & Brokers • Mortgage Finance • Regional Banks • Specialty Finance | Real Estate • Housing • Land Development • Property Services • Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) • Residential Services

As of December 31, 2017, our research department included 23 publishing research analysts providing investment recommendations on 454 public companies divided among our four target sectors. Approximately 37% of the stocks under coverage had market capitalizations of less than $1.0 billion. 
 

Asset Management
 
Through HCS, JMPAM, JMP Credit Advisors, and HCAP Advisors, we actively manage a family of two hedge funds, four private equity funds and one entity, HCC, formed to provide loans to small and midsized U.S. companies. As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of $1,064.1 million in client assets under management (including assets of employees and portfolio managers) and an additional $14.7 million of our own capital invested in these vehicles. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we had invested $10.6 million in entities managed by certain third parties.
 
HCAP Advisors manages HCC for the purpose of making investments in the form of subordinated debt and, to a lesser extent, senior debt and minority equity investments, primarily in privately held, small and midsized U.S. companies. As of December 31, 2017, HCC’s portfolio consisted of 31 loans with an aggregate fair value of $115.6 million. As the investment advisor, HCAP Advisors earns a base management fee equal to 2% of the gross assets annually, excluding cash and cash equivalents, and an incentive fee of 20% of the net operating income, assuming that a hurdle rate of 8% is achieved, in addition to 20% of the realized gains, net of realized and unrealized losses, subject to a three-year high-water mark. 
 
The objective of our multiple investment strategies is to diversify both revenue and risk while maintaining the attractive economics of the alternative asset management model. We view asset management as an attractive business due to its high margins and the recurring nature of its fee-based revenues, as well as its dependence on intellectual capital, which we believe is less susceptible to competitive threats from larger financial institutions.
 
In the course of advising clients on strategic or private capital raising transactions, our investment bankers may identify instances in which we could commit our own capital to transactions for which we are acting as an agent. In addition, opportunities to invest equity and debt capital are frequently brought to the attention of our asset management professionals. As a result, in certain cases in the past we have made principal investments, and in some of those cases we have earned attractive returns on the capital we have committed. We expect that we will continue to make such investments in the future and believe that we may continue to earn attractive returns in some instances.

JMP Credit Advisors currently serves as the investment manager to CLO III, CLO IV, and CLO V, which together had a diversified portfolio of 551 corporate loans with an aggregate par amount of $0.9 billion and restricted cash available to lend of $40.2 million as of December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, JMP Credit Advisors earned management fees of $3.5 million from CLO I, CLO II, CLO III, CLO IV and CLO V. CLO I and CLO II were liquidated in the first and second quarters, respectively. Because we consolidate the CLOs in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), the management fees earned from the CLOs are eliminated upon consolidation. 
 
JMP Credit Advisors also provides HCC with administrative services and is thus reimbursed by HCC for expenses, including the allocable percentage of the compensation costs for the employees performing services under the agreement. 
Competition
 
All areas of our business are subject to a high level of competition. The principal competitive factors influencing our business include the capabilities of our professionals, our industry focus and expertise, our client relationships, our professional reputation, our product and service offerings, and the quality and price of our products and services.
 
Since the mid-1990s, there has been substantial consolidation among U.S. and global financial institutions. In particular, a number of large commercial banks, insurance companies and other diversified financial services firms have merged with other financial institutions or have established or acquired broker-dealers. During 2008, the failure or near-collapse of a number of very large financial institutions led to the acquisition of several of the most sizeable U.S. investment banking firms, consolidating the financial services industry to an even greater extent. Currently, our competitors are other investment banks, bank holding companies, securities brokerage firms, merchant banks and financial advisory firms. Our focus on four target industries subjects us to direct competition from a number of institutional brokerage firms and investment banking boutiques that also specialize in providing services to these industries and their investors.
 
The industry trend toward consolidation has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of many of our competitors. Our larger and better-capitalized competitors may be more able than we are to respond to changes in the investment banking industry, to recruit and retain skilled professionals, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth and to compete for market share generally. Many of these firms have the ability to offer a wider range of products than we do, including loans, deposit-taking and insurance, in addition to brokerage, asset management and investment banking services, all of which may enhance their competitive position relative to us. These firms also have the ability to support investment banking and securities products with commercial banking, insurance and other financial services revenues in an effort to gain market share, which could result in downward pricing pressure in our businesses. In particular, the trend in the equity underwriting business toward multiple bookrunners and co-managers, with bookrunners earning a disproportionately large portion of underwriting fees, has increased competition in the investment banking industry while placing downward pressure on average transaction fees.
 
As we seek to expand our asset management business, we face competition in the pursuit of investors for our investment funds, in the identification and completion of investments in attractive portfolio companies, securities or real estate assets, and in the recruitment and retention of skilled asset management professionals.
 
Net interest income from our corporate credit business depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire loans with yields that exceed our borrowing costs. A number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we make. We compete with other CLO managers, business development companies, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks and commercial finance companies. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds than us and access to financing sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish a larger number of business relationships than us.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 230 employees, including 88 managing directors. We believe that our managing directors and other professionals are attracted to our firm because of our entrepreneurial culture, our focused industry coverage and our dedication to providing growth companies and growth investors with exceptional client service, objective advice and innovative solutions. None of our employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.
Risk Management and Compliance
 
Because we operate an investment bank and several different asset management platforms, risk is an inherent part of our business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. The principal risks we face are market, liquidity, credit, legal, reputational and operational risks. We believe that we exercise sound practical judgment and undertake rigorous quantitative analysis before engaging in transactions to ensure that appropriate risk mitigators are in place. We mitigate risk by carefully considering the amount of capital allocated to each of our businesses, establishing trading limits, setting credit limits for individual counterparties and, to the extent that we make principal investments, committing capital to transactions in instances when we believe we have the advantage of industry or company-specific expertise. As part of our corporate credit and principal investment activities, we conduct due diligence before making any significant capital commitment, and all significant investments must be approved by our investment committee and/or board of directors. Our participation in any underwritten offering is evaluated and approved by a committee of key capital markets, investment banking, compliance and legal professionals. Our focus is always on balancing risk and return, in that we attempt to achieve returns from each of our businesses that are commensurate with the risks they assume. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of our approach to managing risks can never be completely assured. For example, unexpected large or rapid movements or disruptions in one or more markets or other unforeseen developments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The consequences of these developments can include losses due to adverse changes in our principal investments and marketable security values, decreases in the liquidity of trading positions, increases in our credit exposure to customers and counterparties, and increases in general systemic risk.

Regulation
 
As a participant in the financial services industry, we are subject to complex and extensive regulation of most aspects of our business by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies, self-regulatory organizations and securities exchanges. The laws, rules and regulations comprising the regulatory framework are constantly changing, as are the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws, rules and regulations. The effect of any such changes cannot be predicted and may impact our operations and affect our profitability.
 
Our broker-dealer subsidiary, JMP Securities, is subject to regulations governing every aspect of the securities business, including the execution of securities transactions; capital requirements; record-keeping and reporting procedures; relationships with customers, including the handling of cash and margin accounts; the experience of and training requirements for certain employees; and business interactions with firms that are not members of regulatory bodies.
 
JMP Securities is registered as a securities broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of FINRA. FINRA is a self-regulatory body composed of members such as our broker-dealer subsidiary that have agreed to abide by the rules and regulations of FINRA. FINRA may expel, fine and otherwise discipline member firms and their employees. JMP Securities is also licensed as a broker-dealer in each of the 50 states in the U.S., requiring us to comply with the laws, rules and regulations of each state. Each state may revoke the license to conduct securities business, fine and otherwise discipline broker-dealers and their employees.
 
JMP Securities is subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule, Rule 15c3-1, which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our broker-dealer subsidiary. The Uniform Net Capital Rule sets the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of a broker-dealer's assets be relatively liquid. In addition, JMP Securities is subject to certain notification requirements related to withdrawals of excess net capital.
 
We are also subject to the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”), which imposes obligations regarding the prevention and detection of money-laundering activities, including the establishment of customer due diligence, customer verification and other compliance policies and procedures. The conduct of research analysts is also the subject of rule-making by the SEC, FINRA and the federal government through the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These regulations require certain disclosures by, and restrict the activities of, research analysts and broker-dealers, among others. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in monetary, regulatory and, in the case of the USA Patriot Act, criminal penalties.
 
Our asset management subsidiaries, HCS, JMPAM, JMP Credit Advisors, and HCAP Advisors, are SEC-registered investment advisers and are accordingly subject to regulation by the SEC. Requirements under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 include record-keeping, advertising and operating requirements, as well as prohibitions on fraudulent activities.
 
Various regulators, including the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators and attorneys general, are conducting both targeted and industry-wide investigations of certain practices relating to the financial services industry, including marketing, sales practices, valuation practices, asset managers, and market and compensation arrangements. These investigations have involved mutual fund companies, broker-dealers, hedge funds, investors and others.
 
In addition, the SEC staff has conducted studies with respect to soft dollar practices in the brokerage and asset management industries and proposed interpretive guidance regarding the scope of permitted brokerage and research services in connection with soft dollar practices.
 
In July 2010, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act institutes a wide range of reforms that will impact financial services firms and requires significant rule-making. In addition, the legislation mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking procedures and studies and will take effect over several years. As a result, we cannot assess the impact of these new legislative and regulatory changes on our business at the present time. 
Accounting, Administration and Operations
 
Our accounting, administrative and operations personnel are responsible for financial controls, internal and external financial reporting, compliance with regulatory and legal requirements, office and personnel services, management information and telecommunications systems, and the processing of our securities transactions. We use a third-party service provider for payroll processing and servicing of asset-backed securities issued, and our clearing operations are currently performed by National Financial Services LLC. All of our data processing functions are performed by our management information systems personnel. We believe that our continued growth will require implementation of new or enhanced communications and information systems and training of our personnel, or the hiring of an outsourced provider to operate such systems. Any difficulty or significant delay in the implementation or operation of new systems or the training of personnel could harm our ability to manage growth.
