ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
 
CalAtlantic Group, Inc. builds well-crafted homes in thoughtfully designed communities that meet the desires of customers across the homebuilding spectrum, from entry level to luxury, in over 40 metropolitan statistical areas spanning 17 states. Also providing mortgage, title and escrow services, we are focused on providing an exceptional end-to-end homebuying experience for our customers.  For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 Homebuilding Revenue (consisting of home and land sales revenues) accounted for over 98% of our consolidated total revenue.
 The Company's homebuilding operations are divided into four regions: North, Southeast, Southwest and West, consisting of the following metropolitan areas at December 31, 2016:

Dollar Value of Backlog
 
The dollar value of our backlog as of December 31, 2016 was $2.7 billion, or 5,817 homes.  We expect all of our backlog at December 31, 2016 to be converted to deliveries and revenues during 2017, net of cancellations.
Homebuilding Operations
 With a trusted reputation for quality craftsmanship, exceptional architectural design and an outstanding customer experience earned over our 51 year history, we utilize our five decades of land acquisition, development and homebuilding expertise to acquire and build desirable communities in locations that meet the high expectations of our homebuyers.  Our homes sizes typically range from approximately 1,500 to 3,500 square feet, although we have built homes from 1,100 to over 6,000 square feet.  The sales prices of our homes generally range from approximately $165,000 to over $2 million.  At December 31, 2016, we owned or controlled 65,424 homesites (including joint ventures) and had 583 active selling communities.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 85% of our deliveries were single-family detached homes.  The remainder of our deliveries were single-family attached homes, generally townhomes and condominiums configured with eight or fewer units per building.
 We customize our home designs to meet the specific needs of each particular market and its customers' preferences. These preferences are reflected in every aspect of our community sales and marketing, including community locations and amenities, exterior styles, and model home merchandising.  We also offer structural and design options that allow customers to personalize their home to meet their needs and desires.
 
Financial Services Operations
 
We have a mortgage financing subsidiary that provided financing to 57% of our homebuyers who chose to finance their home purchases during 2016.  We also have a title subsidiary that provides title examination and other title and escrow related services and an insurance subsidiary that provides homeowners' and other insurance products to homebuyers in certain of our markets.  Staffed by a team of professionals experienced in the new home purchase process and our sales and escrow procedures, our financial services operations benefit our homebuyers by offering a dependable source of competitively priced financial services that are seamlessly integrated into our home sales and close process.  Each of these businesses complement our homebuilding operations by making the timing of our new home deliveries more predictable.  We sell substantially all of the loans we originate in the secondary mortgage market.
 
Strategy
 
Through the October 1, 2015 combination of Standard Pacific Homes and Ryland Homes to form CalAtlantic Group, Inc., we gained what we believe is important geographic and product diversification, expanding our reach and enhancing our growth prospects in the entry level, move-up and luxury market segments. While our homes span the price point spectrum, we intend to continue to focus the operations in most of our markets on serving the needs of the move-up homebuyers who we believe are more likely to value and pay for the quality construction and customer service experience that are the hallmarks of our legacy brands.
 
Our strategy includes the following elements:
 
 
· | acquire land in desirable locations at acceptable prices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | leverage our land acquisition and master plan development expertise and reputation to garner an advantage in the competitive market for highly sought after locations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketing and Sales
 Our homes are marketed through a variety of channels, including through individual communities where new homes are sold by local sales teams. At the community level, home shoppers have the opportunity to experience fully-furnished and landscaped model homes that demonstrate the livability of our floorplans. Our forward-thinking architectural philosophy is a key differentiator in marketing to the homebuyers we target. We closely examine buyer preferences communicated to our sales team and through buyer surveys. This research, coupled with the skilled expertise of architects who have both domestic and international experience, provides our homebuyer thoughtful solutions that cater to the way people live today through innovative ideas and practical conveniences.
 Many buyers begin or supplement their buying process via online research, which allows us to engage and inform them through a robust website and a wide array of digital marketing initiatives. Brokers and real estate professionals are a viable extension of our sales team and we market to them directly.
 Our homes are sold pursuant to written sales contracts that usually require the homebuyer to make a cash deposit. We sell both pre-built and to-be-built homes. The majority of our homebuyers have the opportunity to purchase various optional amenities and upgrades such as prewiring and electrical options, upgraded flooring, cabinets, finished carpentry and countertops, varied interior and exterior color schemes, additional and upgraded appliances, and some alternative room configurations. Purchasers are typically permitted for a limited time to cancel their contracts if they fail to qualify for financing. In some cases, purchasers are also permitted to cancel their contract if they are unable to sell their existing homes or if certain other conditions are not met. A buyer's liability to us for wrongfully terminating a sales contract is typically limited to the forfeiture of the buyer's cash deposit to the Company, although some states provide for more limited remedies.
 Development and Construction
 
We customarily acquire unimproved or improved land zoned for residential use.  To control larger land parcels or gain access to highly desirable parcels, we sometimes form land development joint ventures with third parties that provide us the right to acquire from the joint venture a portion of the lots when developed.  If we purchase raw land or partially developed land, we will perform development work that may include negotiating with governmental agencies and local communities to obtain any necessary zoning, environmental and other regulatory approvals and permits, and constructing, as necessary, roads, water, sewer and drainage systems and recreational facilities like parks, community centers, pools, and hiking and biking trails.  With our long California heritage of creating master planned communities, we have expertise and experience in handling complex development opportunities.
 
We act as a general contractor with our supervisory employees coordinating most of the development and construction work on a project.  Independent architectural design, engineering and other consulting firms are generally engaged on a project-by-project basis to assist in project planning and community and home design, and subcontractors are engaged to perform all of the physical development and construction work.  Although the construction time for our homes varies from project to project depending on geographic region, the time of year, the size and complexity of the homes, local labor situations, the governmental approval processes, availability of materials and supplies, and other factors, we typically complete the construction of a home in approximately four to six months, with a current average cycle time of approximately five months.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
We, either directly or indirectly through our subcontractors, purchase drywall, cement, steel, lumber, insulation and the other building materials necessary to construct a home.  While these materials are generally widely available from a variety of sources, from time to time we experience serious material shortages on a localized basis, particularly during periods where the regions in which we operate experience natural disasters that have a significant impact on existing residential and commercial structures and during periods of robust sales activity when there is high demand for construction materials.  During these periods, the prices for these materials can substantially increase and our construction process can be slowed.
Seasonality and Longer Term Cycles
 
Our homebuilding operations have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in the spring and summer months, although new order activity is highly dependent on the number of active selling communities and the timing of new community openings as well as other market factors. Because it typically takes us four to six months to construct a new home, we typically deliver a greater number of homes in the second half of the calendar year as spring and early summer orders are converted to home deliveries. As a result, our revenues and cash flows

(exclusive of the amount and timing of land purchases) from homebuilding operations are generally higher in the second half of the calendar year, particularly in the fourth quarter.
 
Our homebuilding operations are also subject to longer term business cycles, the magnitude, duration, beginning and ending of which are difficult to predict. At the high point of this business cycle, the demand for new homes and new home prices are at their peak. Land prices also tend to be at their peak in this phase of the cycle. At the low point in the cycle, the demand for homes is weak and land prices tend to be more favorable. While difficult to accomplish, our goal is to deliver as many homes as possible near the top of the cycle and to make significant investments in land at the bottom of the cycle.
 
We believe we were at or near the bottom of the current cycle for the several years prior to 2012 and, as such, made substantial investments in land.  We plan to continue to make substantial investments in land, which is likely to utilize a significant portion of our cash resources, so long as we believe that such investments will yield results that meet our investment criteria.
 
Competitive Conditions in the Business
 
The homebuilding industry is fragmented and highly competitive. We compete with numerous other residential construction companies, including large national and regional firms, for customers, land, financing, raw materials, skilled labor, and employees. We compete for customers primarily on the basis of home design and location, price, customer satisfaction, construction quality, reputation, and the availability of mortgage financing. While we compete with other residential construction companies for customers, we also compete with resales of existing homes and rental properties.
 
Financing
 We typically use both our equity (including internally generated funds from operations and proceeds from equity offerings and the exercise of stock options) and debt financing in the form of bank debt and note offerings, to fund land acquisition and development and construction of our properties.  To a lesser extent, we use seller financing to fund the acquisition of land and, in some markets, community facility district or other similar assessment district bond financing is used to fund community infrastructure such as roads, water and sewers.
 We also utilize joint ventures and option arrangements with land sellers, other builders and developers as a means of accessing lot positions, expanding our market opportunities, establishing strategic alliances, leveraging our capital base and managing the financial and market risk associated with land holdings.  In addition to equity contributions made by us and our partners, our joint ventures may obtain secured project specific financing to fund the acquisition of land and development and construction costs.  For more detailed discussion of our current joint venture arrangements please see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements".
 Government Regulation
 
For a discussion of the impact of government regulations on our business, including the impact of environmental regulations, please see the risk factors included under the heading "Regulatory Risks" in the Risk Factors section.
Financial Services
 
Customer Financing
 
As part of our ongoing operations, we provide mortgage loans to many of our homebuyers through our mortgage financing subsidiary, CalAtlantic Mortgage.  Our mortgage subsidiary's principal sources of revenue are fees generated from loan originations, net gains on the sale of loans and net interest income earned on loans during the period we hold them prior to sale.  In addition to being a source of revenues, our mortgage operations benefit our homebuyers and complement our homebuilding operations by offering a dependable source of competitively priced financing, staffed by a team of professionals experienced in the new home purchase process and our sales and escrow procedures, all of which help to make our new home deliveries more predictable.
 
We sell substantially all of the loans we originate in the secondary mortgage market, with servicing rights released on a non-recourse basis.  These sales are generally subject to our obligation to repay the gain on sale if the loan is prepaid by the borrower within a certain time period following such sale, or to repurchase the loan if, among other things, the loan 
 
4
 

purchaser's underwriting guidelines are not met or there is fraud in connection with the loan.  We record reserves for loan- related claims when we determine it is appropriate to do so.
 For a portion of our loan originations, we manage the interest rate risk associated with making loan commitments to our customers and holding loans for sale by preselling loans.  Preselling loans consists of obtaining commitments (subject to certain conditions) from third party investors to purchase the mortgage loans while concurrently extending interest rate locks to loan applicants.  Before completing the sale to these investors, our mortgage subsidiary finances these loans under its mortgage credit facilities for a short period of time (typically for 30 to 45 days), while the investors complete their administrative review of the applicable loan documents.
 We also originate a portion of our mortgage loans on a non-presold basis.  When originating mortgage loans on a non-presold basis, we lock interest rates with our customers and fund loans prior to obtaining purchase commitments from third party investors, thereby creating interest rate risk.  To hedge this interest rate risk, our mortgage subsidiary enters into forward sale commitments of mortgage-backed securities.  Loans originated in this manner are typically held by our mortgage subsidiary and financed under its mortgage credit facilities for a short period of time (typically for 30 to 45 days) before the loans are sold to third party investors.  Our mortgage subsidiary utilizes third party hedging software to assist with the execution of its hedging strategy for loans originated on a non-presold basis.
 While preselling loans and our hedging strategy is designed to reduce our risk, our hedging strategy instruments involve elements of market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates that could result in losses on loans originated in this manner and we remain subject to risk relating to purchaser non-performance, particularly during periods of significant market turmoil.
 Title, Escrow and Insurance Services
 
Our title, escrow and insurance subsidiaries provide title, escrow and insurance services to homebuyers in many of our markets.  We are in the process of expanding this business and, consequently, the level of title, escrow and insurance services we currently provide in any particular market vary, ranging from full title, escrow and insurance services in certain geographies to limited title examination services in others.Employees
 
At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 3,055 employees, up from approximately 2,850 employees at the prior year end.  Of our employees at the end of 2016, approximately 650 were executive, administrative and clerical personnel, 1,100 were sales and marketing personnel, 815 were involved in construction and project management, 175 were involved in new home warranty, and 315 worked in the financial services operations.  None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, although employees of some of the subcontractors that we use are represented by labor unions and may be subject to collective bargaining agreements.  We believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good.
