ITEM 1.          BUSINESS
General
 
HPC Acquisitions, Inc., DBA Vegalab US (“VUS”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is the exclusive North and South America distributor of Vegalab products supplied by Vegalab SA, Switzerland (“VSA”). Vegalab products consist of biological pesticides, fertilizers, and specialty biological agents that are highly effective against targeted organisms, non-toxic to beneficial organisms, and safe for the environment. VUS holds registrations for its products in a number of US states, Costa Rica, and Panama, and is pursuing additional registrations domestically and in Canada, Mexico, and Central/ South America. To facilitate marketing and sales, VUS is engaged in a number of testing projects for its products with agricultural businesses. In 2016, VUS began distributing product, which resulted in $2,115,421 of revenues by the end of the year and a net loss from operations of $95,279 for the calendar year.
The Market Opportunity
 
Consumer demands are rapidly changing. Customers want foods produced with natural, non-synthetic, and sustainable inputs. According to a report issued by TechSci Research on the global organic food market, the projected compounded growth in the global market for organic food is 14% per year through 2021. We believe a growing number of food manufacturers are replacing, or are looking to replace, synthetic inputs in order to create all natural products that will meet the growing consumer demand for naturally produced foods.
 
Increasing consumer pressure to minimize chemical residue in food and regulations restricting or banning the use of chemical compounds in the food chain are primary drivers of a growing demand for eco-friendly fertilizers, bio-pesticides and specialty biological agents in large scale agricultural businesses. According to a report published by Research and Markets, the projected global market for bio-pesticides alone is estimated to reach $8.82 billion by the year 2022, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 17.6% from 2016.
 
The convergence of changing consumer preferences, and the commitment of agri-business to reduce chemical compounds in the environment and to produce natural food products, has created what management believes is a substantial opportunity for growth in the distribution of Vegalab products.

These products are “natural” in that the active ingredients consist primarily of oil extracts from different plant sources. The efficacy of the raw material is effectuated and enhanced through a process of micronization, nano-encapsulation, and amplification.
 
Previously, organic and natural products had to wait to be broken down or eroded in order to be absorbed by plants, making these products inefficient and expensive for commercial use. The challenge with oil extracts is lowering viscosity to maximize dispersion over large areas without impairing potency. The micronization process used to produce our products addresses this problem; the process gives these oils the ability to cover a larger surface area and enables deeper penetration into the crevices of plants, insects, and pathogens.
 
After micronization, these oils go through a process of amplification, which involves being paired with specific adjuvants and alcohol-based solvents to increase the oil-to-water bonding capacity. This results in the products having higher dilution rates with better efficacy than other oil-based products on the market. Finally, the products are nano-encapsulated, which allows the products to remain dormant until activated in the presence of specific conditions, such as soil moisture, pH, and temperature, which further enhances the efficiency of our products. Our fertilizers have unique formulations containing organic compounds that facilitate the absorption of minerals, increase growth rates, and enhance overall crop quality. The fertilizers we offer are formulated to reduce their chemical footprint and to increase absorption into the plant. With our product formulations, the applicator is able to use smaller amounts of fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, etc. to achieve better crop results than the current standard synthetic products on the commercial market.

Distribution Agreement
 
VUS has the exclusive right to market and sell the Vegalab products in the Western Hemisphere. David Selakovic, a director, officer, and principal stockholder of VUS, assigned this exclusive distribution right to VUS in March 2016. Mr. Selakovic held the distribution rights under a distribution agreement dated October 19, 2012, with ECOWIN Co., Ltd., a Korean company that owns the intellectual property related to the processes for manufacturing the Vegalab products and manufactures products VUS sells. Additions, removals, and modifications of the Vegalab products may be made at the discretion of ECOWIN. ECOWIN is required to provide 90-days advance notice of the discontinuation of a product. For a new product, ECOWIN is required to provide 30-days advance notice of the addition of the new product, and during that period VUS has the right to decline the addition of the product to the distribution agreement.
 
VSA is a Swiss company of which David Selakovic is the sole owner, and it is the world-wide distributor of the products we offer, subject to the exclusive rights of VUS in the Western Hemisphere. At the present time we purchase all of our products from VSA at its cost.
 
VSA publishes a product price list periodically, which lists the distributor price to VUS for all product ordered through VSA. Prices are FOB (Freight on Board) the factory. Pricing is subject to change at any time at the election of VSA on 30-days advance written notice to VUS. Payment is made in US Dollars by irrevocable letter of credit issued at the time of the order and payable 90 days from the date of the bill of lading.
 
VUS has a duty to use all reasonable commercial efforts to develop and exploit the maximum sales for the entire line of products covered by the distribution agreement. This includes the obligation to:
 

· | Establish a trained sales force;
--+---------------------------------


· | Purchase and maintain an adequate selection and stock of products to meet reasonably expected demand;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Deliver monthly sales reports;
--+-------------------------------


· | Advertise and promote the products, including participation in trade shows; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Obtain and maintain all governmental permits or registrations required to market and sell the products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Under the distribution agreement, products we purchase for resale are warranted by the manufacturer to be free of defects in material and workmanship for a period of 24 months. At its discretion, the manufacturer may replace or repair defective products, or issue a refund of the purchase price.

Distributing Our Products
 
We began distribution of our products in April 2016, which involves several steps. First, we have been aggressively pursuing registration of Vegalab products in jurisdictions where we believe there is an opportunity to commence sales soon after registration is achieved. There are numerous jurisdictions in the North and South American Sphere where we can sell product, and we are only beginning to penetrate the large market available to us. We are focusing our efforts on jurisdictions that major distributors of farming products or major agro-industrial companies have indicated to us they believe are good candidates for distributing and selling our products. The next step in the process is to arrange product testing opportunities for the distributors and companies interested in our products, several of which have been completed with very positive results, and more are in the pipeline. Finally, we negotiate the terms of the distribution or purchase agreements.
 
Our distribution process began to gain traction by the end 2016. In November 2016, we entered into an agreement with Food and Agriculture Innovative Technologies Enterprises Limited for distribution in Trinidad and Tobago, which includes an option to expand to neighboring islands. We also reached an exclusive distribution agreement with Fertica Group for Guatemala where the product registration is in process, and we are pursuing discussions to expand that agreement into El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras.
 
Product sales and distribution in a number of jurisdictions will be cyclical based on the growing season for the jurisdiction and other factors.
 
Competition
 
The products we will distribute compete with similar products produced by other agrichemical businesses, as well as with traditional agrochemicals. Many of these competitors have well established products, brands, market share, and have much greater financial and operational resources than we do. Being the new entrant in a well-established market is a difficult task, and there is no assurance we can compete effectively on the basis of product content and performance, or on price.
 
We believe our eco-friendly products have an advantage over traditional agro-chemicals because of testing and reports showing that many agro-chemicals, particularly pesticides and some fertilizers, degrade the environment and are potentially harmful to humans, which results in higher regulatory scrutiny and restrictions, as well as potential liability under federal and local laws. We believe the absence of these negative characteristics in our eco-friendly products make them very appealing to potential distributors and end users and gives us an advantage we can promote when competing with traditional agro-chemicals.
 
Regulatory Considerations
 
Our activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations. These regulations may prevent us or our collaborators from developing or commercializing products in a timely manner or under technically or commercially feasible conditions, and may impose expenses, delays and other impediments to our product development and registration efforts. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) regulates our bio-based pest management products under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (“FFDCA”) and the Food Quality Protection Act (“FQPA”). In addition, our fertilizers are regulated as fertilizers or biostimulants in each of the fifty states.

In 2004, the United States Congress passed the Pesticide Registration Improvement Renewal Act, which was reauthorized in 2007 and 2012, a result of efforts from an industry coalition of pesticide companies and environmental groups, to codify pesticide approval times in return for user fees. This law facilitates faster approval times for biopesticides, with EPA approvals typically received within 16 to 24 months, compared with 36 months or longer for conventional chemical pesticides. Registration processes for state and foreign governments vary between jurisdictions and can take up to 12 months for state governments, such as California and New York, and up to 36 months or more for foreign governments. In some instances, California and Canada will conduct joint reviews with the EPA, which allows some pesticides to receive concurrent approvals in California, Canada and the United States. However, in most instances, most foreign government submissions will not occur until after a U.S. registration has been secured. To register a crop protection product with the EPA, companies must demonstrate the product is safe to mammals, non-target organisms, endangered species and the environment. To demonstrate the bio-based pest management product’s safety, required studies must be conducted that evaluate mammalian toxicology, toxicological effects to non-target organisms in the environment (ecotoxicological exposures) and physical and chemical properties of the product. The registration dossier is subject to both scientific and administrative reviews by EPA scientists and management before registration approval. The scientific review involves thorough evaluation of submitted data and completion of risk assessments for human dietary and ecotoxicological exposures. Upon completion of this process, the registration package, including the proposed label, is sent to the Office of General Council for legal review. The final step in the registration process is administrative sign-off by the EPA director of the Biopesticides and Pollution Prevention Division.
 
In addition to EPA approval, we are required to obtain regulatory approval from the appropriate state regulatory authority in individual states and foreign regulatory authorities before we can market or sell any pest management product in those jurisdictions. Foreign governments typically require up to two seasons of locally generated field efficacy data on crop-pest combinations before a product dossier can be submitted for review. California and foreign jurisdictions also require us to submit product efficacy data, which the EPA historically has not required, but may request.
 
We engage third party contractors with experience in the regulatory registration processes of federal and local governments to assist us with obtaining regulatory approvals and permits for our products.
 
Since our plant fertilizers are not used to control pests, they currently fall outside the legal scope of FIFRA, FFDCA and FQPA and, therefore, we do not need to submit applications for EPA registrations for such products. However, we must still submit state registrations for our fertilizers, and those containing microbes of foreign origin may also need to be “deregulated” (or determined not to be a plant pest) under the Plant Protection Act by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service prior to use in field trials or for large scale release. Nevertheless, the regulatory process is significantly accelerated compared to that for bio-pesticides.
 
Annex I to this report is a current list of the government registrations we have obtained for our products.

History
 
On March 8, 2016, VUS closed the sale of 12,011,000 shares of common stock to David Selakovic at a total purchase price of $303,100, paid in cash. Concurrently, Mr. Selakovic was appointed a director, and to the positions of Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer. Craig S. Laughlin, the former Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Financial Officer, remained a director and serves as the President and Secretary of VUS. In connection with the foregoing investment and changes in management, Mr. Selakovic assigned to VUS certain assets consisting of (a) the exclusive right to distribute in the Western Hemisphere natural agrochemicals marketed under the name “Vegalab” and manufactured by ECOWIN Co., Ltd., a Korean company, (b) certain governmental permits for the sale of ECOWIN agrochemicals, and (c) the trademark “Vegalab.” As a result of the foregoing transactions VUS acquired distribution rights to the Vegalab products, permits related to those products, a trademark, and cash to commence the business of selling Vegalab products.
 
During the two-year period prior to the investment by Mr. Selakovic in VUS, we were classified as a “shell company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), seeking to acquire or develop a business opportunity.
 
Employees
 
HPC has no full-time employees. Our executive officers are responsible for implementing our business described above with the assistance of independent contractors.
