--------+---------

 We are a global provider of cloud and on-site business communications and collaboration solutions. Through our software product development, we help more than 70 million end users around the world, including more than a million cloud-based Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) subscribers, to seamlessly connect, collaborate and provide innovative solutions to their customers. Our global customer base leverages Mitel innovation every day in approximately 100 countries and has helped us become: 
 

 | the #2 market share leader worldwide for UCaaS;
--+------------------------------------------------


 | the #1 global market share leader for unified communications in Europe; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the #4 provider of business communications in the world.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 Our strategy is built on the principle of putting customers first and providing an exceptional customer experience. We do that by providing a seamless technology path that will enable businesses to communicate, collaborate and participate in the digital transformation and application economy that is reshaping business models and competition globally. Since 2011, we have fundamentally reoriented our company from an on-site or premise-based unified communications and telephony business to become a diverse global market leader with established positions in next-generation cloud and enterprise markets. 
 As a result of both our organic in-house development and our merger and acquisition activity, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to offer customers globally a comprehensive portfolio of complementary and interoperable communications and collaboration solutions. 
 In the third quarter of 2017, we completed the acquisition of ShoreTel, accelerating our move-to-the-cloud strategy by investing further and faster into the UCaaS market as businesses worldwide increasingly look for cloud and cloud-capable solutions to digitally transform their businesses. 
 Our software, applications and services enable customers to upgrade and enhance their communications environments at their own pace, whether in a cloud or on-site enterprise environment. Our solutions generally interoperate with various systems supplied by other vendors, including global market leaders such as VMware, Microsoft, Salesforce.com, Google, Amazon Web Services and Rackspace. This interoperability allows our customers to utilize their existing communications infrastructure and gives them the flexibility to choose the solutions that best address their individual business needs. We have also designed our software, applications and end-user devices to allow access to our solutions from mobile devices. Our mobile applications are compatible and available for use on some of the worlds leading mobile devices, including those from Apple and Samsung. We complement our communications solutions with support, professional and managed services for our customers that range from planning and design through to implementation. 
 Our cloud-based communications services and solutions (reported as the Cloud segment) provide a full range of private, public, hybrid and mobile Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions for businesses of all sizes. This offering includes UCaaS solutions, which enable businesses to consume and pay for their communications services on a monthly subscription basis. 
 Our broad range of on-site unified communications and collaboration (UCC) solutions (reported as the Enterprise segment) enables us to address and support the full spectrum of technology specifications  from digital to IP, from platforms to services, and for fixed or mobile end-user devices. Our enterprise solutions include the latest virtualized, cloud-enabled and software-based capabilities and desktop and mobile applications to enable businesses of all sizes to take advantage of the most advanced technology developments while maximizing their current communications investments. 
 We have invested heavily in the research and development (R&D) of our IP-based communications and collaboration solutions to take advantage of the worldwide shift from traditional digital communications systems to cloud, mobile and application-based solutions. We believe our early and sustained R&D has positioned us to capitalize on the industry shift from legacy systems to IP and cloud communications solutions, including UCC solutions used in desktop and mobile environments. We control a global patent portfolio of more than 1,600 patents and pending applications. We believe our R&D provides us with the enhanced knowledge to anticipate expected market trends and to meet the current and future needs of our customers and channel partners. 
 With a global geographic footprint, we are structured around three primary geographic markets defined as the Americas, which includes the United States, Canada and the Caribbean and Latin America; EMEA, which includes the continent of Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific, which includes the continent of Asia and the Pacific region, including Australia and New Zealand.

Segments 
 Our business is organized into Cloud and Enterprise segments. 
 Cloud Segment 
 The Cloud segment includes a comprehensive family of cloud-based communications products, services and applications that, in most cases, are consumed by customers on a monthly subscription basis (as a fixed operational expense) with the option to rent phones, aiming to eliminate the need for organizations to buy and maintain a phone system on their premises. Primarily offered under the MiCloud brand, the portfolio includes a full suite of cloud-based UCC solutions (voice services, dial plans, audio conferencing, voicemail, call center functionality, video conferencing, along with team collaboration applications) that provide seamless mobility and reliability, and are built to suit small and growing businesses along with large-scale enterprises. MiCloud solutions and services are sold in a direct and indirect model for the consumption of end users and partners alike. The portfolio also enables partners and service providers to create highly optimized service offerings they can host themselves or through a Mitel-operated data center. 
Enterprise Segment 
 The Enterprise segment includes our products, services and applications that support customers that prefer private cloud or on-site or deployments. Primarily offered under the MiVoice brand, the Enterprise portfolio integrates voice, unified communications and collaboration applications, and contact center applications on fixed and mobile networks across a wide range of end-user devices, such as desk phones, mobile phones, tablets, desktop and laptop computers. This includes our IP-based telephony platforms, desktop devices, in-building mobile devices, UCC and contact center applications that are primarily deployed on the customers premises. Our on-site portfolio is typically sold as an initial sale of hardware and software, with ongoing recurring revenue from hardware and software maintenance and other managed services that we may also offer. 
Mitel Product PortfolioOverview 
 By offering a comprehensive portfolio of solutions and services, including cloud and on-site enterprise communications products and solutions, UCC and contact center applications and a variety of value-added service offerings, Mitel aims to offer our customers flexibility, freedom of choice and a seamless path to the cloud as and when they choose. Our portfolio includes: 

Cloud | On-site 
MiCloud Office | Business IP and digital phones (wired and wireless)
MiCloud Business | MiVoice communications platforms 
MiCloud Flex (formerly MiCloud Enterprise) | MiVoice Connect (formerly Connect ONSITE) 
MiCloud Connect (formerly Connect Cloud) | MiCollab UCC applications 
MiCloud Contact Center | MiContact Center applications 
MiCloud for Service Providers | IPedge / CIX communications platforms 
Clearspan | Service offerings 

Partnerships 
 One important result of the evolution of integrated communications and cloud solutions is the simplicity with which products and services, from a variety of sources, can be easily integrated to provide a better solution for customers. By partnering with others, we can concentrate on our core areas of expertise while leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners for the benefit of customers. We have four key types of technology partnerships: strategic alliances, operational partners, affiliates and solution alliances. 
Customers 
 Our customers include more than 70 million business end users, ranging from the smallest business to the largest enterprise, and include more than a million UCaaS subscribers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues from continuing operations in fiscal 2017. We have also developed a comprehensive understanding of certain vertical markets, such as hospitality, education, government, healthcare, and retail. Our solutions can be tailored to meet the business communications needs of these and other vertical markets.

Competition 
 We compete in the cloud and on-site enterprise communications markets, providing products and services for transporting data, voice and video traffic across intranets, extranets, mobile networks and the internet. These markets are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages. These market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our new product markets. As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. 
 Competitors for our Cloud solutions include hosted and cloud services providers, such as Avaya, Inc., Atos SE, Broadsoft, Inc. (which entered into a definitive agreement in October 2017 to be acquired by Cisco Systems), Cisco Systems, Inc., 8X8, Inc., Fuze, Inc., j2 Global, Inc., Ribbon Communications, RingCentral, Inc., Verizon Communications Inc., Vonage Holdings Corp., West IP Communications, Inc., and other hosted PBX providers. In our wholesale cloud offerings, we also face competition from AT&T, Inc. and other communications service providers. 
 Competitors for our Enterprise solutions are primarily from two groups of vendors: Traditional IP communications vendors; and software vendors that are adding communications and collaboration solutions to their offerings. We compete against many traditional IP communications vendors, including Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise, Ascom Holding AG, Avaya, Inc., Atos SE, Cisco Systems, Inc., Enghouse Interactive, Ericsson-LG, Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc., Grandstream Networks, Inc., Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd, NEC Corporation, Panasonic Corporation, Polycom, Inc., Snom Technology GmbH, VTech Holdings Limited and Yealink Inc. We also compete with software vendors who, in recent years, have expanded their offerings to address the UCC market. This group of competitors includes Microsoft Corporation, Google LLC, and Slack. 
 Some of these companies compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. New ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing and sales positions in those markets. We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and in our view this trend may increase. In addition, because the market for our products is subject to rapid technological change as the market evolves, we may face competition in the future from companies that do not currently compete in our markets, including companies that currently compete in other sectors of the information technology, communications and software industries. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Our products, solutions and services are primarily sold through an indirect go-to-market model. We address the needs of business customers in approximately 100 countries through over 4,000 channel partners, distribution partners and master agents. We believe our extensive channel partner network, combined with our corporate and regional support, allows us to scale our business for volume and sell our solutions globally, resulting in an efficient cost-of-sale model. We recruit our channel partners with a focus on expanding go-to-market coverage and securing the skills needed to successfully sell, implement and support our communications solutions. 
 Research and Development 
 Our customers are at the center of our R&D program. We regularly seek to introduce new products, features, applications and services to address the requirements of our customers. We put the customer at the center of everything we do. Our history of success in software-based cloud and enterprise communications solutions has provided us with the foundation for continued innovation. In recent years, we have increasingly invested in cloud-based R&D to support our rapidly growing cloud business. Our R&D personnel are skilled with deep domain expertise in the diverse areas of telecommunications, IP networking, unified communications, Contact Center solutions software and vertical applications. We work to continuously improve our R&D efforts through operational measurement, adoption of best practices, effective partnerships and investment in our people. 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 900 employees working in our R&D department on cloud and enterprise solutions. Our global R&D workforce is located predominantly in North America, Europe, and India. 
 Please see Item 6, Selected Financial Data, of Part II in this Annual Report for the amount spent during each of the last five fiscal years on R&D activities determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.

Manufacturing and Supply Chain Management 
 A significant amount of our cloud and enterprise portfolios consists of appliances and desktop devices. Our objective is to deliver high-quality and unique products to our customers and channel partners while optimizing our operational cost structure and ensuring continuity of supply. To meet this objective, we leverage our contract manufacturers to protect supply continuity and facilitate manufacturing portability across manufacturers. 
 We primarily use high-volume contract manufacturers. Our primary contract manufacturers are Flex Ltd. and Celestica, Inc. We also utilize a number of smaller contract manufacturers for our legacy product portfolio. 
 In order to maintain our continuity of supply and reduce supply chain barriers, our strategy for several years has been to procure our high-volume products from a number of contract manufacturers. For our new high-volume products, we implement portable designs by limiting the use of custom and sole source components and by adhering to industry-standard Design For Manufacture and Design For Test guidelines. We manage our own product distribution facilities either directly or through the use of third-party logistics management specialists, all of which are managed by our logistics team. This is implemented with geographically diverse points of distribution, with our principal facilities located in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Switzerland. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our intellectual property assets include patents, industrial designs, trademarks, proprietary software, copyrights, domain names, operating and instruction manuals, trade secrets and confidential business information. These assets are important to our competitiveness and we continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio in order to protect our rights in new technologies and markets. We have a broad portfolio of more than 1,600 patents and pending applications, covering more than 500 inventions, in areas such as Voice over IP, collaboration, presence, messaging and mobility. 
 We leverage our intellectual property by asserting our rights in certain patented technologies. Certain companies have licensed or offered to purchase patents within our portfolio. 
 Our solutions contain software applications and hardware components that are either developed and owned by us or licensed to us by third parties. The majority of the software code embodied in our products has been developed internally and is owned by us. 
 In some cases, we have obtained non-exclusive licenses from third parties to use, integrate and distribute with our products certain packaged software, as well as customized software. This third-party software is either integrated into our own software applications or sold as separate self-contained applications, such as voicemail or unified messaging. The majority of the software that we license is packaged software that is made generally available and has not been customized for our specific purpose. If any of our third-party licenses were to terminate, our options would be to either license a functionally equivalent software application or develop the functionally equivalent software application ourselves. 
 We have also entered into a number of non-exclusive license agreements with third parties to use, integrate and distribute certain operating systems, digital signal processors and semiconductor components as part of our communications platforms. If any of these third-party licenses were to terminate, we would look to license functionally equivalent technology from another supplier. 
 It is our general practice to include confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions in the agreements entered into with our employees, consultants, manufacturers, end users, channel partners and others to attempt to limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. In addition, it is our practice to enter into agreements with employees that include an assignment to us of all intellectual property developed in the course of their employment. 
 The risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Intellectual Property. 
 Employees 
 We had a total of approximately 3,820 employees worldwide as of December 31, 2017. We consider our relationship with our employees to be positive. Competition for technical personnel in the industry in which we compete is intense. We believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, integrate, and retain qualified personnel. To date, we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees, but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future.
