Item 1 — Business
Industry Overview
Prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare today and constitute the first line of treatment for many medical conditions. For many, prescription drugs provide the hope of improved health and quality of life.
Total medical costs for employers continue to outpace the rate of overall inflation, in particular, the increase in high cost drugs to treat complex conditions such as cancer, hepatitis and multiple sclerosis. National health expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product are expected to increase to 20% in 2026 from 18% in 2017 according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”). With increasing cost pressures being exerted on health benefit providers such as managed care organizations, health insurers, employers and unions, there is an increasing role for pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) companies to develop innovative strategies to put medicine within reach of patients by making better health more affordable and accessible.
PBM companies typically combine retail pharmacy claims processing and network management, formulary management, utilization management and home delivery pharmacy services to develop an integrated product offering to manage the prescription drug benefit for payors. Some PBMs also offer specialty medication services that deliver a more effective solution than many retail pharmacies in providing treatments for diseases that rely upon high-cost injectable, infused, oral or inhaled drugs. Some PBMs have also broadened their service offerings to include medication adherence programs, outcomes research, drug therapy management programs, sophisticated data analysis and distribution services.
Company Overview
We are the largest independent PBM company in the United States, offering a full range of services to our clients, which include managed care organizations, health insurers, third-party administrators, employers, union-sponsored benefit plans, workers’ compensation plans, government health programs, providers, clinics, hospitals and others. We put medicine within reach of patients while helping health benefit providers improve access to prescription drugs by making them more affordable. We can improve patient outcomes and help control the cost of the drug benefit by:

• | identifying products and offering solutions that focus on improving patient outcomes and assist in controlling costs;


• | evaluating drugs for efficacy, value and price to assist clients in selecting a cost-effective formulary;


• | offering cost-effective home delivery pharmacy and specialty services that result in cost savings for plan sponsors and better care for members;


• | leveraging purchasing volume to deliver discounts to health benefit providers; and


• | promoting the use of generics and lower-cost brands.

We work with clients, manufacturers, pharmacists and physicians to improve members’ health outcomes and satisfaction, increase efficiency in drug distribution and manage costs of the pharmacy benefit. We believe our clients can achieve the best financial and health outcomes when they use our comprehensive set of solutions to manage drug spend. For example, our management toward greater use of generic drugs and lower-cost brand drugs has resulted in significant reductions in spending for our health benefit plan clients and their members.
We have two business segments based on the products and services we offer: PBM and Other Business Operations. See further description of our segments within “Part I — Item 1 — Business — Segment Information.”
Our revenues are generated primarily from the delivery of prescription drugs through our contracted network of retail pharmacies, our home delivery pharmacies and our specialty pharmacies. Revenues from the delivery of prescription drugs represented 98.2% of our revenues in 2017, 98.3% in 2016 and 98.0% in 2015. Revenues from services, such as fees for the 
2

administration of formulary management processing for certain client contracts that do not include claims adjudication and the dispensing of prescription drugs, medical benefit management services, as well as, other fee-for-service arrangements, such as medication counseling services and certain specialty services accounted for the remainder of our revenues. 
Prescription drugs are dispensed to members of the health plans we serve primarily through networks of retail pharmacies under non-exclusive contracts with us and through home delivery fulfillment pharmacies, specialty drug pharmacies and fertility pharmacies we operate. More than 68,000 retail pharmacies, which represent over 98% of all United States retail pharmacies, participated in one or more of our networks as of December 31, 2017. The top ten retail pharmacy chains in the United States represent approximately 67% of the total number of stores in our largest network.
Express Scripts, Inc. (“ESI”) was incorporated in Missouri in September 1986, and was reincorporated in Delaware in March 1992. Aristotle Holding, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in July 2011. On April 2, 2012, ESI consummated a merger (the “Merger”) with Medco Health Solutions, Inc. (“Medco”) and both ESI and Medco became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Aristotle Holding, Inc. Aristotle Holding, Inc. was renamed Express Scripts Holding Company (the “Company” or “Express Scripts”) concurrently with the consummation of the Merger. When we use the terms “Express Scripts,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we mean Express Scripts Holding Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless we state or the context implies otherwise.
Our principal executive offices are located at One Express Way, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63121. Our telephone number is (314) 996-0900 and our website is www.express-scripts.com. Information included on our website is not incorporated into this annual report. 
Segment Information
We report segments on the basis of the products and services we offer and have determined we have two reportable segments: PBM and Other Business Operations. 
See “Part I — Item 1 — Products and Services” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further description of our products and services. See “Part II — Item 8 —Note 13 - Segment information” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further description of our segments.
Products and Services
Pharmacy Benefit Management Services
Overview. Our PBM services involve management of prescription drug utilization and cost to drive high quality, cost-effective pharmaceutical care. We consult with clients to assist in the selection of plan design features that balance clients’ requirements for cost control with member choice and convenience. We focus our solutions to enable better decisions in four important and interrelated areas: benefit choices, drug choices, pharmacy choices and health choices. As a result, we believe we deliver better outcomes, higher member satisfaction and a more affordable prescription drug benefit. During 2017, 95.2% of our revenues were derived from our PBM operations, compared to 96.2% and 97.3% during 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Clinical Solutions. We offer innovative clinical programs to drive better health outcomes at lower cost by identifying and addressing unsafe, ineffective and wasteful prescribing, dispensing and utilization of prescription drugs and intervening with, or supporting interventions with, physicians, pharmacies and patients. RationalMed® evaluates medical, pharmacy and laboratory data to detect critical patient health and safety issues which are then addressed through timely notification to physicians, pharmacies, patients and case managers. ScreenRx® uses proprietary predictive models to detect patients at risk for nonadherence and proactively addresses the problem through interventions tailored specifically for that patient. ExpressAlliance® offers patient care coordination services that enable patient-authorized healthcare professionals to share a common view of a patient’s health record and coordinate patient outreach and counseling. Advanced Opioid ManagementSM solution works comprehensively with patients, prescribers and pharmacies to minimize early exposure to opioids while helping prevent progression to overuse and abuse.
Express Scripts SafeGuardRx®. We offer a suite of solutions targeting therapy classes that pose clinical challenges for patients and a significant budgetary threat to our clients. Our solutions focus on keeping our clients ahead of the cost curve while providing patients the care and access they need. These solutions include (but are not limited to): Pulmonary Care Value ProgramSM; Multiple Sclerosis Care Value ProgramSM; Inflammatory Conditions Care Value ProgramSM; Diabetes Care Value ProgramSM; Hepatitis Cure Value Program®; Cholesterol Care Value Program®; Oncology Care Value Program®; Market Events Protection Program®; and Inflation Protection ProgramSM. These solutions are offered throughout our PBM services.

Through innovative programs such as Express Scripts SafeGuardRx, which combines utilization management controls with formulary management, the specialized care model of our Therapeutic Resource Center® program (described below) and comprehensive guarantees, we are changing the market in key specialty categories. Our programs covering oncology and inflammatory conditions in particular have introduced a value-based contracting approach, with payments now tied to a product’s effectiveness at the indication level rather than a single uniform reimbursement across multiple indications with varying degrees of product effectiveness. 
Specialized Pharmacy Care. At the center of Express Scripts’ condition-specific approach to care are Therapeutic Resource Center services, which are pharmacy practices that specialize in caring for members with the most complex and costly conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, HIV, asthma, depression and other rare and specialty conditions. Therapeutic Resource Center services are designed to optimize the safe and appropriate dispensing of therapeutic agents, minimize waste and improve clinical and financial outcomes. Through our Therapeutic Resource Center services, specialist pharmacists provide the expert, personalized care patients increasingly demand.
Home Delivery Pharmacy Services. We dispense prescription drugs from our four high-volume automated dispensing home delivery pharmacies and one non-automated dispensing home delivery pharmacy. In addition to the order processing that occurs at these home delivery pharmacies, we operate several non-dispensing order processing facilities and patient contact centers. Our pharmacies provide patients with convenient access to maintenance medications and enable us to manage our clients’ drug costs through operating efficiencies and economies of scale, as well as provide greater safety and accuracy than retail pharmacies. Through our home delivery pharmacies, we are directly involved with the prescriber and patient and, as a result, our research shows we are generally able to achieve a higher level of generic substitutions, therapeutic interventions and better adherence than is achieved through the retail pharmacy networks.
Specialty Pharmacy Services. Specialty medications are used primarily for the treatment of complex diseases. These medications are broadly characterized to include those with frequent dosing adjustments, intensive clinical monitoring, the need for patient training, specialized product administration requirements and/or medications limited to certain specialty pharmacy networks by manufacturers. Through a combination of assets and capabilities, we provide an enhanced level of care and therapy management for patients taking specialty medications, increased visibility and improved outcomes for payors, as well as custom programs for biopharmaceutical manufacturers.
Our subsidiary Accredo Health Group (“Accredo”) is focused on dispensing injectable, infused, oral or inhaled drugs that require a higher level of clinical service and support compared to what is typically available from traditional pharmacies. Accredo is able to achieve better outcomes for patients and reduced waste for clients through a disease-centric organization, specialty trained clinicians, a nationwide footprint, a network of in-home nursing services, reimbursement and patient assistance programs, and biopharmaceutical services.
Our subsidiary Freedom Fertility is a leading specialty pharmacy focused on the needs of fertility patients and providers. Through Freedom Fertility, we also provide insurance assistance and patient education and support.
We also provide medical benefit drug management services, which enable greater oversight of our clients’ specialty spend billed through the medical benefit and are designed to ultimately make specialty drugs more affordable and accessible. Through our medical benefit drug management services, we offer a wide range of tools that span both the medical and pharmacy benefit in order to optimize the use of specialty medications through channel, network and utilization management. These tools include guaranteed savings programs, promoting the safe and appropriate use of high-cost specialty drugs, redirecting patients and medications to the lowest-cost and most appropriate channel, verifying claims are paid at the contracted rate, improving opportunities to achieve rebates and, where clinically appropriate, moving drug coverage from medical to pharmacy benefit and to lower-cost sites of care.
Retail Network Pharmacy Administration. We contract with retail pharmacies to provide prescription drugs to members of the pharmacy benefit plans we manage. In the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, we negotiate with pharmacies to discount the prices at which they provide drugs to members and manage national and regional networks responsive to client preferences related to cost containment, convenience of access for members and network performance. We also manage networks of pharmacies customized for or under direct contract with specific clients and have contracted with pharmacy provider networks to comply with CMS access requirements for the federal Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program (“Medicare Part D”).
All retail pharmacies in our pharmacy networks communicate with us online and in real time to process prescription drug claims. When a member of a plan presents his or her identification card at a network pharmacy, the network pharmacist sends certain specified member, prescriber and prescription information in an industry-standard format through our systems, which process the claim and send a response back to the pharmacy with relevant information to process the prescription. 
4

Benefit Design Consultation. We consult with our clients on how best to structure and leverage the pharmacy benefit to meet plan objectives for providing affordable access to the prescription medications people need to stay healthy, and helping ensure the safe and effective use of those medications.
Drug Utilization Review. We review prescriptions for safety and effectiveness, in real-time, electronically and systematically, when presented to our pharmacies or submitted for coverage by network pharmacies, and alert the dispensing pharmacy to detected issues. Issues not adequately addressed at the time of dispensing may also be communicated to the prescriber retrospectively. 
Drug Formulary Management. Formularies are lists of drugs with designations which may be used to determine drug coverage and member out-of-pocket costs, and communicate plan preferences in competitive drug categories. Our formulary management services support clients in establishing formularies that best meet plan objectives for access, safety and affordability, and assist patients and physicians in choosing clinically appropriate, cost-effective drugs.
We administer specific formularies on behalf of our clients, including standard formularies developed and offered by Express Scripts and custom formularies for which we play a more limited role. The majority of our clients select standard formularies, governed by our National Pharmacy & Therapeutics Committee (the “P&T Committee”), a panel of independent physicians and pharmacists in active clinical practice, representing a variety of specialties and practice settings and typically with major academic affiliations. In making formulary recommendations, the P&T Committee considers the drug’s safety and efficacy, without any information on or consideration of the cost of the drug, including any discount or rebate arrangement we might negotiate with the manufacturer. This process is designed to ensure the clinical recommendation is not affected by our financial arrangements. We fully comply with the P&T Committee’s clinical recommendations regarding drugs that must be included or excluded from the formulary based on their assessment of safety and efficacy. 
Medicare, Medicaid and Health Insurance Marketplace (“Public Exchange”) Offerings. We support our clients by providing several Medicare program options: the Retiree Drug Subsidy (“RDS”) program, which is offered by CMS to reimburse municipalities, unions and private employers for a portion of their eligible expenses for retiree prescription drug benefits; the Employer-Sponsored Group Waiver Plan (“EGWP”), a group-enrolled Medicare Part D option for employers and labor groups; and the “PBM inside” service that offers claims adjudication and related patient services supporting Medicare drug benefits to a number of Medicare plan sponsors (i.e., health plans serving Medicare). As a PBM supporting Medicare plan sponsors, we provide prescription adjudication services in addition to a suite of required programmatic offerings such as a Medication Therapy Management program, an Explanation of Benefits for members using prescription services and a variety of member communications related to the prescription benefit. We also offer an individual prescription drug plan (“PDP”) to beneficiaries in all 34 Medicare regions across the United States, as well as Puerto Rico.
Our revenues include premiums associated with these risk-based Medicare Part D PDP product offerings. The products involve underwriting the benefit, charging enrollees applicable premiums, providing covered prescription drugs and administering the benefit as filed with CMS. Our insurance company subsidiaries operate under various contracts with CMS. We provide three Medicare Part D PDP options for beneficiaries: a standard Medicare Part D benefit plan as mandated by statute and two enhanced coverage plans that offer additional options for coverage. We also offer numerous customized benefit plan designs to employer group retiree plans within our Medicare Part D PDP product offerings.
Our member website supports pre-enrollment and post-enrollment activities on behalf of our Medicare Part D PDP product offerings serving multiple clients. Prospective Medicare Part D participants and their caregivers can use the pre-enrollment site’s Plan Compare tool to accurately project costs for medications. The post-enrollment site allows members who have signed up to receive a Medicare Part D benefit from either Express Scripts or one of our Medicare plan sponsor clients to securely manage all aspects of their prescription program.
We support health plans serving Medicaid populations by offering a pharmacy drug benefit. This business is driven by both federal and state requirements and we earn revenues based on claims-related activity. Common services include transitioning members’ access to drugs as plan offerings change, generating data to states through encounter files and coordinating benefits between states and other payors. Medicaid populations have grown in states that chose to expand Medicaid eligibility. States choosing to use managed health care plans for Medicaid create additional opportunities for us to provide claims-related services.
We also support health plans serving insured Public Exchange members. This business is driven by both federal and state requirements and we earn revenues based on claims-related activity. We offer pharmacy benefit solutions that can be leveraged in plan design to align with any exchange strategy to achieve desired cost and clinical objectives.
Administration of a Group Purchasing Organization. We operate a group purchasing organization (“GPO”) that negotiates pricing for the purchase of pharmaceuticals from pharmaceutical manufacturers and suppliers. We also provide 
5

various administrative services to GPO participants including negotiation and management of the GPO purchasing contracts. In 2017, Express Scripts’ GPO became a member of the GPO of Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH (“WBAD”). Certain administrative services will transition to the WBAD GPO. There was no change to the legal structure of Express Scripts’ GPO.
Inside RxSM. The Inside Rx program provides affordable access to medication, especially for the uninsured and those navigating the changing healthcare landscape, by delivering broad access to more affordable medications for uninsured and underinsured individuals. Inside Rx partners with participating retail pharmacies and major pharmaceutical companies to provide discounts to patients who would otherwise pay full list price for prescription medications through the use of a discount card. This program works collaboratively across the pharmacy supply chain, with all parties sharing a singular focus: to ensure patients have affordable access to medication they need.
Digital Consumer Health and Drug Information. We empower member decision-making through online and mobile tools that help guide members in making informed drug, pharmacy and health choices. Information included on our website and mobile app are not part of this annual report.
Other Business Operations Services
Overview. Through our Other Business Operations segment, two of our businesses service patients through multiple paths: CuraScript Specialty Distribution and CareCore National Group, LLC and its affiliates d/b/a eviCore healthcare (“eviCore”). We acquired eviCore during the fourth quarter of 2017 for approximately $3.6 billion. Prior to December 27, 2017, Other Business Operations also included United BioSource Holdings, Inc. (“UBC”). See “Acquisitions, Divestiture and Related Transactions” below for further description of the acquisition of eviCore and the sale of UBC. During 2017, 4.8% of our revenues were derived from Other Business Operations services, compared to 3.8% and 2.7% during 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Provider Services. CuraScript Specialty Distribution (“CSD”) is a specialty distributor of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies (including injectable and infusible pharmaceuticals and medications to treat specialty and rare/orphan diseases) directly to healthcare providers, clinics and hospitals in the United States for office or clinic administration. CSD also operates Matrix GPO, a GPO focused on the purchase of products and services, including specialty pharmaceuticals, for practitioners, which is uniquely positioned to support the needs of its membership. Through our CSD business, we provide distribution services primarily to office and clinic-based physicians who treat patients with chronic diseases and regularly order costly specialty pharmaceuticals. CSD provides competitive pricing on pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, and operates three distribution centers and ships most products overnight within the United States, as well as providing distribution capabilities to Puerto Rico and Guam. CSD is a contracted supplier with most major group purchasing organizations and leverages our distribution platform to operate as a third-party logistics provider for several pharmaceutical companies.
Medical Benefit Management Services. eviCore is a leading provider of integrated medical benefit management solutions that focus on driving adherence to evidence-based guidelines and improve quality of patient outcomes and cost of care reductions for our clients. eviCore manages medical benefits in categories including radiology, cardiology, musculoskeletal disorders, sleep disorders, post-acute care, genetic lab, specialty pharmacy and medical oncology. eviCore contracts with health plans and other commercial and governmental payors to promote the appropriate use of healthcare services and contracts with health plan clients through, in certain instances, capitated risk arrangements where we assume the financial obligation for the cost of healthcare services provided to eligible members covered by its healthcare management programs. 
Pharmaceutical Services. In December 2017, we sold our UBC business. UBC offered consulting services, including design, implementation and project management, for pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers to collect evidence to guide the safe, effective and affordable use of medicines. See “Acquisitions, Divestiture and Related Transactions” below for further description of the sale of UBC.
Suppliers
We maintain inventory of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals in our home delivery and specialty pharmacies. Our specialty pharmacies also carry biopharmaceutical products, including pharmaceuticals for the treatment of rare or chronic diseases, to meet the needs of our patients. If a drug is not in our inventory, we can generally obtain it from a supplier within one business day. We purchase pharmaceuticals either directly from manufacturers or through authorized wholesalers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 54% of the total dollar value of our pharmaceutical purchases were through one wholesaler, but we believe alternative sources are readily available. Generic pharmaceuticals are generally purchased directly from manufacturers.
6

Clients
We are a provider of services to managed care organizations, health insurers, third-party administrators, employers, union-sponsored benefit plans, workers’ compensation plans, government health programs, providers, clinics, hospitals and others.
Express Scripts provides pharmacy network services and home delivery and specialty pharmacy services to the United States Department of Defense (“DoD”). The DoD’s TRICARE Pharmacy Program is the military healthcare program serving active-duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, and retirees, as well as their dependents. Under our DoD contract, we provide to the DoD online claims adjudication, home delivery services, specialty pharmacy clinical services, claims processing and contact center support and other services critical to managing pharmacy trend.
In December 2009, ESI completed the purchase of 100% of the shares and equity interests of certain subsidiaries of Anthem that provide pharmacy benefit management services (“NextRx”). Simultaneous with the purchase, ESI entered into a 10-year contract under which we provide pharmacy benefits management services to members of the affiliated health plans of Anthem. Subsequent to this acquisition, we integrated NextRx’s PBM clients into our existing systems and operations. Our contract with Anthem expires at the end of 2019, with a one year transition period extending through 2020. Based on an announcement by Anthem on October 18, 2017, Anthem will not renew its contract with us. We continue to focus on providing exceptional service to Anthem and its clients in accordance with the terms of our contract. For further discussion of our Anthem relationship, see “Part II — Item 7 — Executive Summary and Trend Factors Affecting the Business.”
Refer to Note 13 - Segment information to our consolidated financial statements included in “Part II — Item 8” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of client concentration, including clients that represent more than 10% of consolidated revenues, which note is incorporated by reference herein.
Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage
We support clients by providing several program options for retirees: the RDS program, which is offered by CMS to reimburse municipalities, unions and private employers for a portion of their eligible expenses for retiree prescription drug benefits; a commercial “wrap” EGWP offering, the “PBM inside” service that offers claims adjudication and related services supporting Medicare Part D drug benefits to a number of Medicare Part D sponsors; and our own risk-based Medicare Part D PDP product offerings.
Acquisitions, Divestiture and Related Transactions
In May 2017, we completed the acquisition of myMatrixx Holdings, Inc. (“myMatrixx”) for approximately $250.0 million, which included both cash and the issuance of common stock. The acquisition is not material to our consolidated financial statements. 
In December 2017, we completed the acquisition of eviCore for approximately $3.6 billion. Operations are included in our reported results beginning as of the date of acquisition and are not material to our consolidated financial results. 
In December 2017, we sold UBC for approximately $150.0 million, the proceeds of which included both cash and a note receivable. We recorded a $17.7 million loss on disposal which is reported within “Interest expense and other” on our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.
For further description of the acquisitions and divestiture noted above, see “Part II — Item 8 — Note 3 - Acquisitions and divestiture.”
We regularly review potential acquisitions and affiliation opportunities. We believe available cash resources, bank financing or the issuance of debt or equity could be used to finance future acquisitions or affiliations. There can be no assurance we will enter into new acquisitions or establish new affiliations in 2018 or thereafter.
Company Operations
General. As of December 31, 2017, our United States PBM segment operated four high-volume automated dispensing home delivery pharmacies, one non-automated dispensing home delivery pharmacy, seven non-dispensing order processing centers, five patient contact centers, nine specialty home delivery pharmacies and 34 specialty branch pharmacies.
We also provide a home delivery service in Canada which dispenses maintenance prescription medications from four regional dispensing pharmacy locations. We provide a full range of integrated PBM services to insurers, third-party 
7

administrators, plan sponsors and the public sector at our Canadian facilities. These services facilitate better health decisions and lower costs and include health claims adjudication and processing services, benefit design consultation, drug utilization review, formulary management and medical and drug data analysis services. 
Sales and Account Management. Our sales and account management teams market and sell PBM solutions and are supported by client service representatives, clinical pharmacy managers, and benefit analysis consultants. These teams work with clients to develop innovative strategies to put medicine within reach of patients while helping health benefit providers improve access to prescription drugs and make them more affordable.
Supply Chain. Our supply chain contracting and strategy teams negotiate and manage pharmacy network contracts, pharmaceutical and wholesaler purchasing contracts and manufacturer rebate contracts. As our clients continue to experience increased cost trends, our supply chain teams are working to combat these price increases by developing new innovative solutions such as Express Scripts SafeGuardRx and narrow networks to deliver savings to our clients. In addition, our Formulary Consulting team, which consists of pharmacists and financial analysts, provides services to our clients in support of formulary decisions, benefit design consultation and utilization management programs.
Clinical Support. Our staff of highly trained healthcare professionals provides clinical support for our PBM and medical benefit management services including more specialized care for patients with select chronic and complex conditions. We operate condition-specific Therapeutic Resource Center facilities staffed with specialist pharmacists, nurses and other clinicians who provide personal and specialized patient care.
Our clinical solutions staff of pharmacists and physicians provides clinical development and operational support for our PBM services. These healthcare professionals are responsible for a wide range of activities including identifying emerging medication-related safety issues and contacting physicians, clients, and patients (as appropriate); providing drug information services; managing formulary; and developing utilization management, safety (concurrent and retrospective drug utilization review) and other clinical interventions.
Our research & analytics team conducts timely, rigorous and objective research that supports evidence-based pharmacy benefit management and evaluates the clinical, economic and member impact of pharmacy benefits. They also use predictive modeling, machine learning and other analytical tools in the development and improvement of our products and services. The team also produces the Express Scripts Drug Trend Report which examines trends in pharmaceutical utilization and cost, the factors triggering those trends and new solutions our clients can implement to control their pharmacy spend while improving the health of their members.
Technology. Our technology team supports our pharmacy and medical benefit claims processing systems, specialty pharmacy systems and other management information systems essential to our operations. We continually seek opportunities to optimize our technology solutions by consolidating and upgrading our technology platforms.
Uninterrupted point-of-sale electronic retail pharmacy claims processing is a significant operational requirement for our business. Claims in the United States are processed through systems managed and operated domestically by internal resources and an outsourced vendor. Canadian claims are processed through systems maintained and operated by a third party in Canada and managed by us. We believe we have substantial capacity for growth in our United States and Canadian claims processing facilities.
We leverage outsourced vendor services to provide certain disaster recovery services for systems located at our data centers. For systems not covered by a third-party vendor arrangement, such as our specialty pharmacy data centers, our corporate disaster recovery organization manages internal recovery services.
Competition
There are a number of other PBMs in the United States with which we compete. Some of these are independent PBMs, such as MedImpact and Navitus Health Solutions. Others are owned by managed care organizations such as Aetna Inc., Humana, OptumRx (owned by UnitedHealth Group) and Prime Therapeutics (owned by a collection of Blue Cross Blue Shield Plans). Some are owned by retail pharmacies, such as CVS Caremark (owned by CVS Health) and Envision Rx (owned by Rite Aid). Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. engages in certain activities competitive with PBMs. We also compete against adjudicators, such as Argus. With the emergence of alternative benefit models through Private Exchanges, the competitive landscape also includes brokers, health plans and consultants. Some of these competitors may have greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do and new market entrants, including strategic alliances aimed at modifying the current healthcare delivery models or entering the prescription drug sector from another sector of the healthcare industry, may increase competitiveness as barriers to entry are relatively low. In addition, the health care industry has undergone periods of substantial consolidation and may continue to consolidate in the future. We believe the primary competitive factors in the industry include the ability to: 
8

negotiate with retail pharmacies to ensure our retail pharmacy networks meet the needs of our clients and their members; negotiate discounts and rebates on prescription drugs with drug manufacturers; navigate the complexities of governmental reimbursed business, including Medicare, Medicaid and the Public Exchanges; manage cost and quality of specialty drugs; utilize the information we obtain about drug utilization patterns and consumer behavior to reduce costs for our clients and members; and the level of service we provide.
Government Regulation and Compliance
Many aspects of our business are regulated by federal and state laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, we maintain a comprehensive compliance program and we believe we operate our business in substantial compliance with all existing legal requirements material to the operation of our businesses. There are, however, significant uncertainties involving the application of various legal requirements, the violation of which could result in, among other things, sanctions. See “Part I — Item 1A — Risk Factors” for additional detail.
Federal Healthcare Reform. The Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (“Health Reform Laws”), targets many aspects of the United States healthcare system, including, but not limited to, enforcement mechanisms and rules related to healthcare fraud and abuse enforcement activities, health plan coverage mandates, rules and obligations for health insurance providers, certain PBM transparency requirements related to the healthcare insurance exchanges and healthcare coverage for Americans in general. The Health Reform Laws impact our business in a variety of ways and long-term impacts remain unclear with respect to the implementation or revision of certain components of the Health Reform Laws and related regulatory guidance. Known impacts include an increase in utilization of the pharmacy and medical benefit by a newly enrolled population with an unknown risk profile, compliance obligations stemming from increased state and federal government involvement in the healthcare marketplace, shifting claims liability from plan sponsors to third-party administrators for certain women’s preventive benefits, data reporting obligations to support health plan issuers and insurers operating in the healthcare exchanges and general market reforms prohibiting the use of many factors traditionally used to establish premiums and adjustments implemented by health plan sponsors and health insurance providers. The ultimate impact of the Health Reform Laws remains unclear as a result of repeal efforts since the 2016 elections, including the repeal of the individual mandate adopted in 2017. 
Medicare Part D. We participate in various ways in Medicare Part D created under the Medicare Modernization Act (“MMA”), and its related regulations and sub-regulatory program guidance (the “Medicare Part D Rules”) issued by CMS. Through our licensed insurance subsidiaries we sponsor Medicare Part D product offerings, Medicare prescription drug coverage and services to Medicare Part D beneficiaries. Through our PBM business, we also provide Medicare Part D-related products and services to other Medicare Part D sponsors, Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plans and other employers and clients offering Medicare Part D benefits to Medicare Part D eligible beneficiaries. On November 28, 2017, CMS released a proposed rule that would revise regulations with respect to Medicare Part C and Part D (the “Proposed Rule”). Among changes to the Medicare Part D program, in particular, the Proposed Rule sought information through a request for information about applying manufacturer rebates at the point of sale and calculating pharmacy price concessions at the point of sale. The ultimate impact of the Proposed Rule on our business may change as the suggested regulations undergo further revision through the comment process.
Medicare Part B and Medicaid. We participate in the Medicare Part B program, which covers certain costs for services provided by Medicare participating physicians and suppliers and for durable medical equipment. We also participate in many state Medicaid programs directly or indirectly through our clients who are Medicaid managed care contractors. We also perform certain Medicaid subrogation services and certain delegated services, including utilization management, for clients, which are regulated by federal and state laws.
Anti-Kickback and Referral Laws. Subject to certain exceptions and “safe harbors,” the federal anti-kickback statute generally prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully paying, receiving or offering any payment or other remuneration to induce a person to purchase, lease, order or arrange for (or recommend purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging) items (including prescription drugs) or services reimbursable in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or another federal healthcare program. Several states also have similar laws, some of which apply similar anti-kickback prohibitions to items or services reimbursable by non-governmental payors. Sanctions for violating these federal and state anti-kickback laws may include criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in the federal and state healthcare programs.
The federal anti-kickback statute has been interpreted broadly by courts, the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) within the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), and various administrative bodies. Because of the federal statute’s broad scope, federal regulations establish certain “safe harbors” from liability. A practice that does not fall within a safe harbor is not necessarily unlawful, but may be subject to scrutiny and challenge. Anti-kickback laws have been cited as a 
9

partial basis, along with state consumer protection laws described below, for investigations and multi-state settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with “product conversion” programs. Other anti-kickback laws may be applicable, such as the Public Contracts Anti-Kickback Act, the ERISA Health Plan Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal “Stark Law” and various state anti-kickback restrictions.
Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law. The federal civil monetary penalty statute provides for civil monetary penalties against any person who gives something of value to a Medicare or Medicaid program beneficiary which the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider for Medicare or Medicaid items or services. Under this law, our wholly-owned home delivery pharmacies, specialty pharmacies and home health providers are restricted from offering certain items of value to influence a Medicare or Medicaid patient’s use of services. The Health Reform Laws also include several civil monetary provisions, such as penalties for the failure to report and return a known overpayment and failure to grant timely access to the OIG under certain circumstances.
Prompt Pay Laws. Under Medicare Part D and certain state laws, some of which also govern the Public Exchanges, PBMs and many of our health plan clients, we may be obligated to pay retail pharmacy and medical benefit providers within established time periods that may be shorter than existing contracted terms and/or via electronic transfer instead of by check. Changes that require faster payment may have a negative impact on our cash flow from operations. 
False Claims Act and Related Criminal Provisions. The federal False Claims Act (the “False Claims Act”) imposes civil penalties for knowingly making or causing to be made false claims or false records or statements with respect to governmental programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, to obtain reimbursement or for failure to return overpayments. Private individuals may bring qui tam or “whistle blower” suits against providers under the False Claims Act, which authorizes the payment of a portion of any recovery to the individual bringing suit. The Health Reform Laws also amended the federal anti-kickback laws to state any claim submitted to a federal or state healthcare program which violates the anti-kickback laws is also a false claim under the False Claims Act. The False Claims Act generally provides for the imposition of civil penalties and for treble damages, resulting in the possibility of substantial financial liabilities. Criminal statutes similar to the False Claims Act provide that if a corporation is convicted of presenting a claim or making a statement it knows to be false, fictitious or fraudulent to any federal agency, the corporation may be fined. Conviction under these statutes may also result in exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs. Many states have also enacted laws similar to the False Claims Act, some of which may include criminal penalties, substantial fines and treble damages.
Government Procurement Regulations. As described above, we have a contract with the DoD, which subjects us to all of the applicable Federal Acquisition Regulations (“FAR”) and DoD FAR Supplement, which govern federal government contracts. Further, there are other federal and state laws applicable to our DoD arrangement and other clients that may be subject to government procurement regulations. In addition, certain of our clients participate as contracting carriers in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program administered by the Office of Personnel Management, which includes various PBM standards.
ERISA Regulation. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) regulates certain aspects of employee pension and health benefit plans, including self-funded corporate health plans, with which we have agreements to provide PBM services. We believe the conduct of our business is not generally subject to the fiduciary obligations of ERISA. However, there can be no assurance the United States Department of Labor (the “DOL”), which is the agency that enforces ERISA, would not in the future assert the fiduciary obligations imposed by ERISA apply to certain aspects of our operations or courts would not reach such a ruling in private ERISA litigation.
In addition to its fiduciary provisions, ERISA has also been held to preempt state laws imposing transparency requirements on PBMs. 
Federal law related to ERISA health plans also imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certain forms of illegal remuneration are made or received. These provisions of ERISA are similar, but not identical, to the healthcare anti-kickback statutes described above, although ERISA lacks the statutory and regulatory “safe harbor” exceptions incorporated into the healthcare statutes. Like the healthcare anti-kickback laws, the corresponding provisions of ERISA are broadly written and their application to particular cases is often uncertain.
Employee benefit plans subject to ERISA are subject to certain rules, published by the DOL, including certain reporting requirements for direct and indirect compensation received by plan service providers such as PBMs. However, a DOL frequently asked questions document stated discount and rebate revenue paid to PBMs by drug manufacturers generally need not be reported on a plan’s Form 5500 as indirect compensation. Self-funded plans which are part of Section 125 “cafeteria plans” are also currently exempt from such compensation disclosure. At this time, we are unable to predict whether the DOL will issue additional regulations or which additional regulations, if any, may be proposed in formal rulemaking by the DOL.
10

State Fiduciary Legislation. From time to time, legislation is considered that would purport to declare a PBM a fiduciary with respect to its clients. While the validity of such laws is questionable and we do not believe any such laws are currently in effect, we cannot predict what effect, if any, such statutes, if enacted, may have on our business and financial results.
Consumer Protection Laws. Most states have consumer protection laws that have been the basis for investigations and multi-state settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to retail pharmacies in connection with product conversion programs. Such statutes have also been cited as the basis for claims against PBMs either in civil litigation or pursuant to investigations by state Attorneys General. 
Network Access Legislation. A majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting our ability, or our clients’ ability, to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove a provider from the network. Such legislation may require us or our clients to admit any retail pharmacy or provider willing to meet the plan’s price and other terms for network participation (“any willing provider” legislation) or may provide that a provider may not be removed from a network except in compliance with certain procedures (“due process” legislation). We have not been materially affected by these statutes.
Certain states have enacted legislation prohibiting certain PBM clients from imposing additional co-payments, deductibles, limitation on benefits, or other conditions (“Conditions”) on covered individuals utilizing a retail pharmacy when the same Conditions are not otherwise imposed on covered individuals utilizing home delivery pharmacies. However, the legislation requires the retail pharmacy to agree to the same reimbursement amounts and terms and conditions as are imposed on the home delivery pharmacies. An increase in the number of prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies may have a negative impact on the number of prescriptions filled through home delivery. We anticipate additional states will consider similar legislation and we cannot predict which states will adopt such legislation or what effect it will have, if any.
Legislation Affecting Plan Design. Some states have enacted legislation that prohibits managed care plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive benefit plan design features, and many states have introduced legislation to regulate various aspects of managed care plans, including provisions relating to the pharmacy benefit. For example, some states, under so-called “freedom of choice” legislation, provide members of the plan may not be required to use network providers, but must instead be provided with benefits even if they choose to use non-network providers. Some states have also enacted legislation, which, as described above, can negatively impact the use of cost-saving network configurations for plan sponsors. Other states have enacted legislation purporting to prohibit health plans from offering members financial incentives for use of home delivery pharmacies. Medicare and some states have issued guidance and regulations which limit our ability to fill or refill prescriptions electronically submitted by a physician to our home delivery pharmacy without first obtaining consent from the patient. Such restrictions generate additional costs and limit our ability to maximize efficiencies which could otherwise be gained through the electronic prescription and automatic refill processes. Legislation has been introduced in some states to prohibit or restrict therapeutic intervention, or to require coverage of all Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved drugs. Other states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions, and require health plan coverage of specific drugs if deemed medically necessary by the prescribing physician. States are also standardizing the process for, and restricting the use of, utilization management rules and shortening the time frames within which prescription drug prior authorization determinations must be made. Even where states do not regulate PBMs or utilization management companies directly, these laws will apply to many of our clients, including managed care organizations and health insurers. If such legislation were to become widely adopted and broad in scope, it could have the effect of limiting the economic benefits achievable through pharmacy benefit management.
Legislation and Regulation Affecting Drug Prices. Some states have adopted so-called “most favored nation” legislation providing a pharmacy participating in the state Medicaid program must give the state the best price the pharmacy makes available to any third-party plan. Such legislation may adversely affect our ability to negotiate discounts in the future from network pharmacies.
Some states have enacted statutes regulating the use of Maximum Allowable Cost (“MAC”) pricing. These statutes, referred to as “MAC Transparency Laws,” generally require PBMs to disclose specific information related to MAC pricing to pharmacies and provide certain appeal rights for pharmacies. MAC Transparency Laws also restrict the application of MAC and may require operational changes to maintain compliance with the law. Some states have also enacted laws regulating pharmacy pricing and protecting the profitability of pharmacies for dispensing certain drugs. These laws have the potential to negatively impact Express Scripts in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, increasing administrative burden and decreasing flexibility in setting and managing pricing, including MAC pricing.
The federal Medicaid rebate program requires participating drug manufacturers to provide rebates on all drugs reimbursed through state Medicaid programs, including through Medicaid managed care organizations. Manufacturers of brand name products must provide a rebate equivalent to the greater of (a) 23.1% of the average manufacturer price (“AMP”) paid by 
11

retail community pharmacies or by wholesalers for certain drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies, or (b) the difference between AMP and the “best price” available to essentially any customer other than the Medicaid program and certain other government programs, with certain exceptions. We negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers and, in certain circumstances, sell services to drug manufacturers. Investigations are being and have been conducted by certain governmental entities which call into question whether a drug’s “best price” was properly calculated and reported with respect to rebates paid by the manufacturers to the Medicaid programs. We are not responsible for such calculations, reports or payments. There can be no assurance, however, our ability to negotiate rebates with, or sell services to, drug manufacturers will not be materially adversely affected by such investigations or regulations in the future.
Regulation of Financial Risk Plans. Fee-for-service prescription drug plans generally are not subject to financial regulation by the states. However, if we offer to provide prescription drug or medical benefit coverage on a capitated basis or otherwise accepts material financial risk in providing the benefit, various state and federal laws may regulate the Company or its subsidiaries. Such laws may require, among other things, the party at risk establish minimum capital adequacy reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility. Laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws, managed care organization laws and limited prepaid health service plan laws. These may apply, for example, to our subsidiary insurance businesses which sponsor risk-based medical benefit management product offerings and Medicare Part D PDP product offerings or EGWP products pursuant to contracts with CMS. Our insurance subsidiaries are required to be licensed insurance companies, and are, therefore, regulated by various state departments of insurance. As such, to maintain licensure as an insurance company, these licensed subsidiaries are required to adhere to state insurance requirements related to, for example, enterprise risk management, beneficiary protections, asset management and financial reserves.
Pharmacy Regulation. Our home delivery and specialty pharmacies are licensed to do business as a pharmacy in the states in which they are located. Most of the states into which we deliver pharmaceuticals have laws that require out-of-state home delivery pharmacies to register with, or be licensed by, the board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body in the state. These states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the home delivery service is located, although some states require compliance with certain laws in that state. We believe we have registered each of our pharmacies in every state in which such registration is required and we comply in all material respects with all required laws and regulations. In addition, our pharmacists and nurses are licensed in those states where we believe their activity requires it. Our various pharmacy facilities also maintain certain Medicare and state Medicaid provider numbers as pharmacies providing services under these programs. Participation in these programs requires our pharmacies to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations, and exposes the pharmacies to various changes the federal and state governments may impose regarding reimbursement methodologies and amounts to be paid to participating providers under these programs. In addition, several of our pharmacy facilities are participating providers under Medicare Part D and, as a condition to becoming a participating provider under Medicare Part D, the pharmacies are required to adhere to certain requirements applicable to Medicare Part D.
Other statutes and regulations affect our home delivery and specialty pharmacy operations, including the federal and state anti-kickback laws and the federal civil monetary penalty law described above. Federal and state statutes and regulations govern the labeling, packaging, advertising, adulteration and security of prescription drugs and the dispensing of controlled substances. The Federal Trade Commission requires mail order sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising, to stock a reasonable supply of the product to be sold, to fill mail orders within thirty days and to provide clients with refunds when appropriate. The United States Postal Service also has significant statutory authority to restrict the delivery of drugs and medicines through the mail.
Other Licensure Laws. Many states have licensure or registration laws governing PBMs, medical benefit management companies, certain types of managed care organizations and insurance companies, including, but not limited to, preferred provider organizations, third-party administrators and companies that provide utilization review services. The scope of these laws differs from state to state, and the application of such laws to the activities of PBMs, medical benefit management companies and insurance companies is often unclear. We have registered under such laws in those states in which we have concluded such registration is required either due to our various PBM or medical benefit management services or the activities of our licensed insurance subsidiaries. Moreover, we have received full accreditation for Utilization Review Accreditation Commission Pharmacy Benefit Management version 2.2 Standards, which includes quality standards for drug utilization management, and select subsidiaries have received full accreditation for Utilization Review Accreditation Commission for Health Utilization Management version 7.2, which includes quality standards for medical utilization management. In addition, accreditation agencies’ requirements for managed care organizations such as the National Committee on Quality Assurance and Medicare Part D regulations for Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plans may affect the services we provide to such organizations.
Legislation regulating PBM and medical benefit management activities in a comprehensive manner has been and continues to be considered in a number of states. In November 2017, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners 
12

(“NAIC”), an organization of state insurance regulators, published a preliminary draft of proposed changes to the Health Carrier Prescription Drug Benefit Management Model Act. The proposed changes would address issues relating to (i) transparency, accuracy and disclosure regarding prescription drug formularies and formulary changes during a policy year; (ii) accessibility of prescription drug benefits using a variety of pharmacy options; and (iii) tiered prescription drug formularies and discriminatory benefit design. It is anticipated the relevant NAIC committees will determine whether to adopt the revisions during the 2018 calendar year. While the actions of the NAIC would not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt model legislation such organizations support. Certain states have adopted PBM registration and/or disclosure laws and we have registered under such laws and are complying with applicable disclosure requirements. In addition to registration laws, some states have adopted legislation mandating disclosure of various aspects of our financial practices, including those concerning pharmaceutical company revenue, as well as prescribing processes for prescription switching programs and client and provider audit terms. Other states are considering similar legislation, and as more states consider these bills, it will be difficult to manage the distinct requirements of each.
Antitrust. The antitrust laws generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, dividing markets and boycotting competitors, regardless of the size or market power of the companies involved. Further, antitrust laws generally prohibit other conduct found to restrain competition unreasonably, such as certain attempts to tie or bundle services together and certain exclusive dealing arrangements.
FDA Regulations. The Health Reform Laws provide a regulatory approval pathway for biosimilars (alternatively known as generics) for biological products and provide an innovator biological product will be granted an exclusivity period of 12 years. At this time, we are unable to fully evaluate the impact of the regulatory changes regarding biosimilars on our business and financial results.
HIPAA and Other Data Privacy and Security Legislation. Many of our activities involve the receipt or use of confidential health and other personal information. In addition, we use aggregated and de-identified data for our own research and analysis purposes and, in some cases, provide access to such data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and third-party data aggregators. Various federal and state laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder (collectively “HIPAA”), regulate and restrict the use, disclosure and security of certain personal information, including health information, and similar legislation is proposed from time to time in various states.
The privacy regulations included as part of HIPAA impose restrictions on the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information by certain entities. The HIPAA security regulations provide controls related to the access to and disclosure of protected health information when it is maintained or transmitted electronically. Other HIPAA requirements relate to (i) electronic transaction standards and code sets for processing of pharmacy claims, (ii) privacy and security requirements vis-à-vis business associates, (iii) breach analysis and notification requirements, (iv) limits on how information is used and disclosed for marketing and fundraising purposes, and (v) limits on the use of a patient’s health information without his or her permission. As with many other companies subject to HIPAA and related laws, these laws may have significant operational and legal consequences for our business. 
We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with HIPAA and other state privacy laws. To date, no patient privacy laws have been adopted that materially impact our ability to provide PBM and pharmacy services, but there can be no assurance federal or state governments will not enact legislation, impose restrictions or adopt interpretations of existing laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
Environmental and Safety Regulations. We are required to comply with certain federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental protection, employee safety, and public health. Any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or other sanctions by governmental bodies or entities.
Other Business Operations Services. Many of the laws and regulations cited above with respect to our PBM activities also apply with respect to our various Other Business Operations services, including, without limitation, the federal and state anti-kickback laws, licensure laws and HIPAA. In addition, as a condition to conducting our wholesale business, we must maintain various permits and licenses with the appropriate state and federal agencies and we are subject to various wholesale distributor laws that regulate the conduct of wholesale distributors, including, but not limited to, maintaining pedigree papers in certain instances.
Intellectual Property Rights
We, and/or our subsidiaries, own and have registered certain trade and service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Examples of our marks include, but are not limited to, EXPRESS SCRIPTS®, MEDCO®, ACCREDO®, CURASCRIPTSD®, MYMATRIXX®, EVICORE HEALTHCARE®, CONSUMEROLOGY®, MY RX CHOICES®,

RATIONALMED®, SCREENRX®, EXPRESSALLIANCE®, EXPRESS SCRIPTS MEDICARE®, EXPRESS ADVANTAGE NETWORK®, HEALTH DECISION SCIENCE®, THERAPEUTIC RESOURCE CENTER®, CONSTELLATION®, EXPRESSPATH®, MEDICUBE®, CHOLESTEROL CARE VALUE PROGRAM®, HEPATITIS CURE VALUE PROGRAM®, EXPRESS SCRIPTS SAFEGUARDRX®, MARKET EVENTS PROTECTION PROGRAM®, ONCOLOGY CARE VALUE PROGRAM®, DIABETES CARE VALUE PROGRAMSM, INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS CARE VALUE PROGRAMSM, INFLATION PROTECTION PROGRAMSM, PULMONARY CARE VALUE PROGRAMSM, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS CARE VALUE PROGRAMSM and INSIDE RXSM.
We also hold a portfolio of patents and pending patent applications. We are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. 
We rely on our agreements with employees, clients, vendors, and other third parties to protect and maintain our confidential information and proprietary rights.
Insurance
We generally maintain insurance coverage for claims that arise in the normal course of business. Where insurance coverage is not available, or, in our judgment, is not cost-effective, we maintain self-insurance accruals to reduce our exposure to future claims, legal costs, settlements and judgments, once such costs become both probable and estimable. Self-insured losses are accrued based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for the costs of uninsured claims incurred.
There can be no assurance we will be able to maintain certain types of liability insurance coverage in the future or that such insurance coverage, together with our self-insurance accruals, will be adequate to cover potential future claims. A claim, or claims, not covered by insurance or in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position and/or consolidated cash flow from operations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we employed approximately 26,600 and 25,600 employees, respectively, worldwide. Approximately 7% of the employees are members of collective bargaining agreements at December 31, 2017. Specifically, we employ members of the following unions: 

• | United Food and Commercial Workers Union;


• | United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial & Service Workers International Union, American Federation of Labor – Congress of Industrial Organizations;


• | Association of Managed Care Pharmacists;


• | International Union of Operating Engineers; and


• | Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, United Food and Commercial Workers.

Four collective bargaining agreements covering certain of these employees will expire at various dates through December 2018.

You should carefully consider these and other relevant factors, including those risk factors in “Part I — Item 1A — Risk Factors” in this Annual Report and any other information included or incorporated by reference in this Report, and information which may be contained in our other filings with the SEC, when reviewing any forward-looking statement. We note these factors for investors as permitted under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
