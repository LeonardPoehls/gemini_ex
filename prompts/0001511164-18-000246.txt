Bankruptcy, Receivership or Similar Proceedings

We have not been involved in a bankruptcy receivership or similar proceeding. Additionally, we have not been involved in a reclassification, merger, consolidation, or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business.
Organization

We were formed as a limited liability company in the state of Florida on April 1, 2010, to engage in the development and distribution of nutritional and dietary oral spray products. On December 3, 2012, we converted from a limited liability company to a Florida Corporation.

Our principal executive office is located at 6601 Lyons Road L-6, Coconut Creek, Florida 33073, and our telephone number is 888-509-8901. Our website is located at www.nutrafuels.com. 

Our Business

Since our inception in April of 2010, we have engaged in the development, manufacturing, and distribution of nutritional and dietary products. In March of 2017, we completed development of CBD products and commenced the distribution of these products. Our distribution strategy includes selling to private label retailers, distributors, and consumers through retail outlets. We had sales of $1,790,168 and $225,293 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, or a six hundred ninety-four point six percent (694.6%) increase. This increase resulted from our sale of CBD products and greater acceptance of our nutritional and dietary products in the marketplace, which led to greater sales.
Product Development

Our products are available as oral spray or tincture products and are designed to provide faster and more efficient absorption than pill or capsule formulas. Each product we offer is based upon the research of Edgar Ward, our Chief Executive Officer, President, and Sole Director, with the assistance of chemists, which we employ. 
 
5

Our products are and, in the future, will continue to be identified by Mr. Ward based upon suggestions from our customers, and from industry and market research he conducts on an ongoing basis. We do not employ medical professionals and our management does not have experience in the healthcare industry or in the treatment of disease. Our products have not been confirmed in any respect by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any other governmental agency, and may not produce the results intended.

Once developed, our products are manufactured at our facility in Coconut Creek, Florida. We obtain all raw materials and ingredients for our products from third party suppliers. For all orders we receive, we manufacture, package, label and ship the product to the customer. Our products are primarily sold to private label distributors who sell the products we manufacture under their own brand names. We do not enter into long term contracts with our private label distributors and all sales are made by purchase order. Our private label distributors are not obligated to order any amount of products from us and can discontinue purchasing our product at any time.

Regulation of our Hemp Finished Products.

The sale of our Hemp Finished Products is potentially subject to a complex web of federal and state regulations that are evolving at a rapid rate. The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of our products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, principally the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), and, to a lesser extent, the Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC"), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Our activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which our products are sold, as well as by governmental agencies in certain countries outside the United States in which our products are sold. These agencies can change their rules at any time. Should we become subject to FDA, DEA or other enforcement proceedings we would have to cease operations.

FDA Regulation of our Hemp Finished  CBD Products

The FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and sale of drugs, food, including dietary supplements, and over-the-counter drugs. We believe our Hemp Finished Products are dietary supplements, not drugs. We have not obtained and do not plan to obtain FDA approval of our Hemp Finished Products. Notwithstanding the preceding statement, the FDA has published position statements, but has not adopted any rules stating, that products containing THC and CBD are drugs which require FDA approval. To date, the FDA has not recognized any product containing derivatives of industrial hemp intended for human or animal consumption as GRAS or Generally Recognized as Safe.  Further, the FDA has established its position that derivatives from cannabis  even if from lawful industrial hemp  are considered an adulterant not appropriate for inclusion in food or dietary supplements. 

As a result, we could be subject to enforcement proceedings by the FDA. We do not believe that FDA enforcement proceedings are likely since our products only contain trace elements of THC and do not cause the "high" associated with the THC in marijuana. Additionally, Hemp Finished Products like those sold by us are sold by large retailers online including Whole Foods, Publix, Wal-Mart and others.  Despite the foregoing, should we become subject to FDA, DEA or other enforcement proceedings we would have to cease operations.

Drug Enforcement Agency Regulation of our Hemp Finished  CBD Products

On December 14, 2016, the DEA issued a Final Rule, effective January 13, 2017, creating a separate Administration Controlled Substances Code Number for marihuana extract under Schedule I, defining marihuana extract as an extract containing one or more cannabinoids, and stated that all extracts that contain CBD will also contain at least small amounts of other cannabinoids. The Final Rule is currently subject to pending challenge, before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where oral argument was given February 15, 2018. This legal challenge is supported by a bipartisan amicus brief, filed in January 2018, by at least 28 members of Congress in the above-referenced legal challenge to the Final Rule. A ruling in this legal challenge is expected in late 2018; the outcome of this legal challenge, if in favor of the DEA, could cause us to cease the distribution of our industrial hemp products.

In March 2017, the DEA clarified that: (i) the Final Rule does not include materials or products that are excluded from the definition of marijuana set forth in the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), (ii) the new drug code includes only those extracts that fall within the CSA definition of marijuana and (iii) if a product consisted solely of parts of the cannabis plant excluded from the CSA definition of marijuana, such product would not be included in the new drug code (7350) or in the drug code for marijuana (7360).

The Agricultural Act of 2014, known as the Farm Bill, which provides for the domestic cultivation of industrial hemp, begins with the clause Notwithstanding the [CSA] . . . thus indicating that industrial hemp is not to be treated as a controlled substance. This interpretation is supported by the Amicus Brief.
 
8

Because our Hemp Finished Products are derived from industrial hemp, our products are excluded from the CSA definition of marihuana. However, other regulations, such as those of the FDA, are applicable to Hemp Finished Products sold as a food, drug or dietary supplement. The FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, ("FDCA"), regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and sale of food, drugs, dietary supplements, and over-the-counter drugs.  The FDA has published position statements, but has not adopted any rules stating, that products containing THC and CBD are drugs which require FDA approval. Further to date, the FDA has not recognized any product containing derivatives of industrial hemp intended for human or animal consumption as GRAS or Generally Recognized as Safe.  However, the FDA has established its position that derivatives from cannabis  even if from lawful industrial hemp  are considered an adulterant not appropriate for inclusion in food or dietary supplements.  

In January 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the rescission of the Cole Memo, memoranda penned by Deputy Attorney General James Cole several years prior, during the Obama Administration. The Cole Memo had instructed U.S. Attorneys across the U.S. to expend federal resources on both federally and state illicit activity related to marijuana, as opposed to expending such resources against marijuana-related business activities acting in accordance with state law (though still federally illegal). Essentially, under the Cole Memo, so long as acting in compliance with state law, marijuana-related business activities would not face intervention or prosecution by federal authorities. The new policy implemented by Mr. Sessions now instructs U.S. Attorneys to exercise their own discretion in ascertaining how to expend federal prosecutorial resources. Though concerning rhetoric, in practice, Mr. Sessions policy has led to little practice change in the month since Mr. Sessions announcement. For example, in Colorado, U.S. Attorney Robert Troyer, Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman and Senator Cory Gardner all quickly announced that little change in enforcement activity would change. Moreover, for the reasons described above, we do not believe the Hemp Finished Products to be appropriately treated as a controlled substance, and thus, neither the Cole Memo, nor Mr. Sessions rescission thereof, applies to the Hemp Finished Products. However, if federal enforcement activity does change as to Hemp Finished Products as a result of Mr. Sessions policy change, such enforcement activities could cause us to cease operations.

Other Regulations Impacting our Hemp Finished - CBD Products

Some states are considering various taxation of marijuana-related products including hemp finished products. These considerations seem to range from routine sales taxes to taxes similar to those imposed on tobacco products. Though, for the reasons described above, we do not believe the Hemp Finished Products to be subject to any marijuana-related taxation schemes, it is unclear whether Hemp Finished Products would fall under these tax plans if and when they are imposed.

IRS section 280(E) prevents cannabis companies from deducting expenses from their income, except for those considered cost of goods sold. No deduction or credit is allowed for any amount paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business if such trade or business (or the activities which comprise such trade or business) consists of trafficking in controlled substances (within the meaning of schedule I and II of the Controlled Substances Act) which is prohibited by federal law or the law of any State in which such trade or business is conducted. Though, for the reasons described above, we do not believe the Hemp Finished Products to be appropriately treated as a controlled substance, IRC 280(E) is enforced against the Company relating to deductions concerning its Hemp Finished Products, such tax treatment could create operating and cash flow problems in the future.

Order Processing

Once developed, our products are manufactured at our facility in Coconut Creek, Florida. We obtain all raw materials and ingredients for our products from third party suppliers. For all orders we receive, we manufacture, package, label and ship the product to the customer. Our products are primarily sold to private label distributors who sell the products we manufacture under their own brand names. We do not enter into long term contracts with our private label distributors and all sales are made by purchase order. Our private label distributors are not obligated to order any amount of products from us and can discontinue purchasing our product at any time. We ship the product ordered within forty-five (45) days to our private label distributors, thirty (30) days to retail customers and within thirty (30) days to wholesale and third party (non-private label) distributors. All orders are shipped by freight delivery at the cost of the customer. All orders placed by My Daily Choice and our other three (3) private label distributors are by purchase order. We require a deposit of fifty percent (50%) upon an order being placed. The balance must be paid by the purchaser prior to shipping.
Distributors

Our products are sold primarily through five (5) private-label distributors. 

Product Quality

In developing our products, we require:

·
 ingredients that are supported with a certificate of analysis, publicly available scientific research and references which our Chief Executive Officer reviews with a chemist who assists in developing our final products;
 ·
 ingredients that are combined so that their effectiveness is not impaired;
 ·
 ingredients in our non-hemp based products that are in dosage levels that fall within tolerable upper intake levels established for healthy people by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies;
 ·
 products that do not contain adulterated ingredients such as ephedra, androstenedione, aspartame, steroids, or human growth hormones; and
 ·
 formulations that have a minimum of one-year shelf life.

Our Growth Strategy
 
Our primary growth strategy is to:

·
 increase our product distribution and sales through increased private label distributors;
 ·
 increase our margins by focusing on increasing our manufacturing capabilities while seeking operating efficiencies in our operations;
 ·
 continue to conduct additional testing of the safety and efficacy of our products and formulate new products using CBD oil and other ingredients;

 increase our sales through direct consumer sales, and
 ·
 increase awareness of our products by increasing our marketing and branding opportunities through social media and sponsorships.

Return and Refund Policy

We will exchange any product found to be defective. A written exchange request must be submitted when a customer returns defective or damaged products. Purchasers can apply for a refund in the full amount of purchased products within ten (10) days of purchase. If the purchasers are not satisfied with our products for any reason, they can return products and request for an exchange. All shipping fees for product exchanges or returns must be paid by the purchaser. Historically, product returns as a percentage of our net sales have been nominal.

Our Core Marketing Strategy
 
Our core marketing strategy is to brand our manufacturing capabilities to private label distributors as the must have for Nutraceutical Sprays and tinctures for companies targeting the health conscious and workout enthusiasts as customers. We seek to be known as The Natural Spray Company, that creates high quality products for distributors and consumers in the health conscious and athletic markets. We believe that our marketing mix of social media promotions and providing sample products for our private label distributors to use is an optimal strategy to increase sales.

In 2016, we launched an advanced website at www.nutrafuels.com, seeking to tap into the social networking world and to further our product brand, direct consumer sales, private label distributor opportunities, and consumer awareness.

Patents and Trademarks

We received federal trademark registration for the expression Spray your way to a healthier day! that we use, or intend to use, to distinguish ourselves from others. All trademark registrations are protected for an initial period of five (5) years and then are renewable after five (5) years, if still in use, and every ten (10) years thereafter.

Material Agreements

On April 10, 2017, we entered into a strategic alliance agreement with Hall Global LLC (HG), a Florida limited liability company controlled by Michael Anderson. The agreement has a term of three (3) years and provides that for three (3) years and three (3) months we will manufacture products for HG in exchange for thirty-three point thirty-three percent (33.33%) of the proceeds of such products. Under the terms of the agreement, payment must be made to us within thirty (30) days after the end of each month. In connection with the agreement, on April 10, 2017 we issued two hundred and fifty thousand (250,000) shares of our restricted common stock to Michael R. Anderson for services rendered as our Chief Scientific Officer. Additionally, we agreed to issue two million (2,000,000) shares of our restricted common stock to Mr. Anderson upon certain equipment being placed at our manufacturing facility. The agreement renews annually with additional consideration of one million (1,000,000) of our common shares. Additionally, we agreed to issue two hundred and fifty thousand (250,000) common shares to Mr. Anderson for our use and distribution of certain technologies including patented Blast Cap and Nutritional drinking straws.
Employees

We have seventeen (17) full time employees as follows:
 ·
 Our Chief Executive Officer, President and Sole Director, Edgar Ward who oversees our day to day operations;
 ·
 Three (3) full time Chemists;
 ·
 One (1) supervisor of our manufacturing facility;
 ·
 Twelve (12) employees who assist in our manufacturing facility; and
 ·
 One (1) Executive Assistant.
 
11

Neil Catania, our Vice President, works closely with Edgar Ward and provides us with approximately ten (10) hours per month of services. We have no other part-time employees. We hire independent contractors on an as needed basis.

None of our employees are employed under a collective bargaining agreement. We believe we have an excellent relationship with our employees and independent contractors.

Manufacturing

We manufacture one hundred percent (100%) of our products. By manufacturing our own products, we believe that we maintain better control over product quality and availability while also reducing production costs. We lease an aggregate of six thousand four hundred (6,400) square feet of office and warehouse space at 6601 Lyons Rd, Suites L-6&7, Coconut Creek, Florida 33073 Approximately five thousand eight hundred (5,800) square feet at this location is used for manufacturing, storage and distribution of our products.

On June 6, 2017, we entered into an agreement to lease nineteen thousand eight hundred and thirty one (19,831) square feet in Deerfield Beach, FL 33441. We plan to use seventeen thousand eight hundred (17,800) square feet of the new Deerfield Beach location for manufacturing, storage and distribution of our products. We expect to occupy this location in May 2018. 

Our manufacturing process generally consists of the following operations: (i) sourcing ingredients for products, (ii) warehousing raw ingredients, (iii) efficacy testing and measuring ingredients for inclusion in products, and (iv) blending using automatic equipment. The next step, bottling and packaging, involves filling, capping, coding, labeling and placing the product in packaging with appropriate tamper-evident features then sending the packaged product to our customers.

The Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") requires companies manufacturing homeopathic medicines to have their facilities certified as Good Manufacturing Practices ("GMPs"). Our non-hemp based nutritional products are subject to FDA regulation. Our manufacturing facility has been fully compliant with its GMP certification. Our quality control program seeks to ensure the superior quality of our products and that they are manufactured in accordance with current GMP. Our processing methods are monitored closely to ensure that only quality ingredients are used and to ensure product purity. Periodically, we retain the services of outside GMP audit firms to assist in our efforts to comply with GMPs.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

We obtain the raw materials for our Hemp Finished Products from two state licensed suppliers located in Kentucky. These raw materials consist of Cannabidiol rich oil and isolate. We obtain the raw materials from our non-hemp based products from several ingredient suppliers located in throughout the U.S. These raw materials consist of naturally derived vitamins and nutrients.

Raw materials used by us are available from a variety of suppliers. We maintain a good relationship with our suppliers and do not anticipate that any of our suppliers will terminate their relationship with us in the near term. We have ongoing relationships with secondary and tertiary suppliers. In the event, we are unable to obtain any of our raw materials from our suppliers; we believe that we could obtain alternative sources of any raw materials from other suppliers. We do not have contracts with our suppliers and we order our raw materials on an as needed basis. We have not experienced any material adverse effects on our business as a result of shortages of raw materials or packaging materials used in the manufacturing of our products. An unexpected interruption or a shortage in supply of raw materials could adversely affect our business derived from these products.

Backlog of Orders

We have no backlog of orders.
 
12

Seasonal Aspect of our Business

None of our products are affected by seasonal factors.

Status of any Publicly Announced New Product or Service

We do not have any publicly announced new product or service.

Competitive Business Conditions

The nutritional and dietary supplement industries are highly competitive. Nutritional supplements include vitamins, minerals, dietary supplements, herbs, botanicals and compounds derived therefrom. Numerous manufacturers and distributors compete with us for customers throughout the United States in the packaged nutritional supplement industry selling products to retailers such as mass merchandisers, drug store chains, independent pharmacies and health food stores. We are also vulnerable to competition from companies that can purchase similar products to our products and private label them with their own brand name.

Many of our indirect competitors are substantially larger, have more experience than us, have longer operating histories, and have materially greater financial and other resources than us.

Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws

We are in a business that involves the use of raw materials in a manufacturing process, however, it is unlikely that such materials are likely to result in the violation of any existing environmental rules and/or regulations. Further, we do not own any real property that could lead to liability as a landowner. Therefore, we do not anticipate that there will be any material costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations.
Government Approvals
 We are not required to obtain governmental approval of our products.

Product Liability Insurance

We maintain commercial liability, including product liability coverage, and property insurance. Our policy provides for a general liability of five million dollars ($5,000,000) per occurrence, and five million dollars ($5,000,000) annual aggregate coverage which includes our main corporate facility. We carry property coverage on our main office facility to cover our legal liability, tenants improvements, business property, and inventory.
Government Regulation

Our operations are potentially subject to a complex web of Federal and state regulations that are evolving at a rapid rate. The DEA and FDA may change rules or enforcement proceedings at any time. We do not believe that current rules and enforcement have a significant potential impact because CBD does not cause the "high" associated with the THC in marijuana. As the legal landscape and understanding about the differences in medical cannabinoids unfolds, it will be increasingly important to distinguish marijuana certain CBD products (with noted varying degrees of psychotropic effects and deficits in executive function) from Hemp Finished Products.

The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of our non-hemp based products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, principally the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), and, to a lesser extent, the Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC"), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Our activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which our products are sold, as well as by governmental agencies in certain countries outside the United States in which our products are sold. Among other matters, regulation by the FDA and FTC are concerned with product safety and claims made with respect to a product's ability to provide health-related benefits. Specifically, the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, ("FDCA"), regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and sale of food, including dietary supplements, and over-the-counter drugs. The FTC regulates the advertising of these products. The National Advertising Division ("NAD") of the Council of Better Business Bureaus oversees an industry sponsored, self-regulatory system that permits competitors to resolve disputes over advertising claims. The NAD has no enforcement authority of its own, but may refer matters that appear to violate the Federal Trade Commission Act or the FDCA to the FTC or the FDA for further action, as appropriate.

Federal agencies, primarily the FDA and the FTC, have a variety of procedures and enforcement remedies available to them including initiating investigations, issuing warning letters and cease and desist orders, requiring corrective labeling or advertising, requiring consumer redress (for example, requiring that a company offer to repurchase products previously sold to consumers), seeking injunctive relief or product seizures, imposing civil penalties, or commencing criminal prosecution. In addition, certain state agencies have similar authority. These federal and state agencies have in the past used these remedies in regulating participants in the food, dietary supplement and over-the-counter drug industries, including the imposition of civil penalties in the millions of dollars against a few industry participants.

The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act ("DSHEA") was enacted in 1994, amending the FDCA. We believe DSHEA is generally favorable to consumers and to the dietary supplement industry. DSHEA establishes a statutory class of "dietary supplements, which includes vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids and other dietary ingredients for human use to supplement the diet. Dietary ingredients marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994 may be marketed without the submission of a "new dietary ingredient" ("NDI") premarket notification to the FDA. Dietary ingredients not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994 may require the submission, at least seventy-five (75) days before marketing of an NDI notification containing information establishing that the ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe for its intended use. Among other things, DSHEA prevents the FDA from regulating dietary ingredients in dietary supplements as "food additives" and allows the use of statements of nutritional support on product labels and in labeling. The FDA has issued final regulations under DSHEA and has issued draft guidance on NDI notification requirements. Further guidance and regulations are expected. Several bills to amend DSHEA in ways that would make this law less favorable to consumers and industry have been proposed in Congress.

The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 ("NLEA) amended the FDCA to establish additional requirements for ingredient and nutrition labeling and labeling claims for foods. If the NLEA labeling requirements change at a future time, we may need to revise our product labeling. Our non-CBD products are classified as dietary supplements. The FDA has concluded that THC and CBD products are excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement. The FDA issued a Final Rule on GMPs for dietary supplements on June 22, 2007. The GMPs cover manufacturers and holders of finished dietary supplement products, including dietary supplement products manufactured outside the United States that are imported for sale into the United States. Among other things, the new GMPs: (a) require identity testing on all incoming dietary ingredients, call for a "scientifically valid system" for ensuring finished products meet all specifications, (b) include requirements related to process controls, including statistical sampling of finished batches for testing and requirements for written procedures, and (c) require extensive recordkeeping.

We have reviewed the GMPs and have taken steps to ensure compliance. While we believe we are in compliance, there can be no assurance that our operations or those of our suppliers will be in compliance in all respects at all times. Additionally, there is a potential risk of increased audits as the FDA and other regulators seek to ensure compliance with the GMPs.
 
14

On December 22, 2006, Congress passed the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, which went into effect on December 22, 2007. The law requires, among other things, that companies that manufacture or distribute nonprescription drugs or dietary supplements report serious adverse events allegedly associated with their products to the FDA and institute recordkeeping requirements for all adverse events (serious and non-serious). There is a risk that consumers, the press and government regulators could misinterpret reported serious adverse events as evidence of causation by the ingredient or product complained of, which could lead to additional regulations, banned ingredients or products, increased insurance costs and a potential increase in product liability litigation, among other things.

The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 ("CPSIA") primarily addresses children's product safety but also improves the administrative process of the CPSC. Among other things, the CPSIA requires testing and certification of certain products and enhances the CPSC's authority to order recalls.

The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act ("FSMA"), enacted January 4, 2011, amended the FDCA to significantly enhance the FDA's authority over various aspects of food regulation. The FSMA granted the FDA mandatory recall authority when the FDA determines if there is reasonable probability that a food is adulterated or misbranded and that the use of, or exposure to, the food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. Other changes include the FDA's expanded access to records; the authority to suspend food facility registrations and require high risk imported food to be accompanied by a certification; stronger authority to administratively detain food; the authority to refuse admission of an imported food if it is from a foreign establishment to which a U.S. inspector is refused entry for an inspection; and the requirement that importers verify that the foods they import meet domestic standards.

One of the FSMAs more significant changes is the requirement of hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls ("HARBPC") for all food facilities required to register with the FDA, except dietary supplement facilities in compliance with both GMPs and the serious adverse event reporting requirements. Although dietary supplement facilities are exempt from the HARBPC requirements, dietary ingredient facilities might not qualify for the exemption. The HARBPC requirements, which the FDA has yet to propose, are expected to be onerous because facilities will have to develop and implement preventive controls to assure that identified hazards are significantly minimized or prevented, monitor the effectiveness of the preventive controls and maintain numerous records related to the HARBPC. The HARBPC requirements may increase the costs of dietary ingredients and/or affect our ability to obtain dietary ingredients.

As required by Section 113(b) of the FSMA, the FDA published in July 2011, a draft guidance document clarifying when the FDA believes a dietary ingredient is an NDI, when a manufacturer or distributor must submit an NDI premarket notification to the FDA, the evidence necessary to document the safety of an NDI and the methods for establishing the identity of an NDI. The draft guidance, if implemented as proposed, could have a material impact on our operations. Although our industry has strongly objected to several aspects of the draft guidance, it is unclear whether the FDA will make changes to the final guidance. In addition, it is possible that the FDA will begin taking enforcement actions consistent with the interpretations in the draft guidance before issuing a final version.

The new FSMA requirements, as well as the FDA enforcement of the NDI guidance as written, could require us to incur additional expenses, which could be significant, and negatively impact our business in several ways, including, but not limited to, the detention and refusal of admission of imported products, the injunction of manufacturing of any dietary ingredients or dietary supplements until the FDA determines that such ingredients or products are in compliance and the potential imposition of fees for re-inspection of noncompliant facilities. Each of these events would increase our liability and could have a material adverse effect on our financial
 condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The FTC and the FDA have pursued a coordinated effort to challenge what they consider to be unsubstantiated and unsafe weight-loss products, and have also coordinated enforcement against dietary supplement claims in other areas, including children's products. Their efforts to date have focused on manufacturers and marketers as well as media outlets, and have resulted in a significant number of investigations and enforcement actions, some resulting in civil penalties of several million dollars under the Federal Trade Commission Act. We expect that the FTC and the FDA will continue to focus on health-related claims for dietary supplements and foods which could cause our non-CBD products to be the subject of an FTC/FDA inquiry.
