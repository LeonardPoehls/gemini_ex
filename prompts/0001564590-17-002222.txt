Overview
 Our mission is to deliver high-speed coherent optical interconnect products that transform communications networks, relied upon by cloud infrastructure operators and content and communication service providers, through improvements in performance and capacity and a reduction in associated costs. By converting optical interconnect technology to a silicon-based technology, a process we refer to as the siliconization of optical interconnect, we believe we are leading a disruption that is analogous to the computing industry’s integration of multiple functions into a microprocessor. Our products include a series of low-power coherent digital signal processor application-specific integrated circuits, or DSP ASICs, and silicon photonic integrated circuits, or silicon PICs, which we have integrated into families of optical interconnect modules with transmission speeds ranging from 100 to 400 Gbps for use in long-haul, metro and inter-data center markets. We are also developing optical interconnect modules that will enable transmission speeds of one terabit (1,000 gigabits) per second and above. Our modules perform a majority of the digital signal processing and optical functions in optical interconnects and offer low power consumption, high density and high speeds at attractive price points. Through the use of standard interfaces, our modules can be easily integrated with customers’ network equipment. The advanced software in our modules enables increased configurability and automation, provides insight into network and connection point characteristics and helps identify network performance problems, all of which increase flexibility and reduce operating costs.
 Our modules are rooted in our low-power coherent DSP ASICs and/or silicon PICs, which we have specifically developed for our target markets. Our coherent DSP ASICs are manufactured using complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, and our silicon PICs are manufactured using a CMOS-compatible process. CMOS is a widely-used and cost-effective semiconductor process technology. Using CMOS to siliconize optical interconnect technology enables us to continue to integrate increasing functionality into our products, benefit from higher yields and reliability associated with CMOS and capitalize on regular improvements in CMOS performance, density and cost. Our use of CMOS also enables us to use outsourced foundry services rather than requiring custom fabrication to manufacture our products. In addition, our use of CMOS and CMOS-compatible processes enables us to take advantage of the technology, manufacturing and integration improvements driven by other computer and communications markets that rely on CMOS.
 Our engineering and management teams have extensive experience in optical systems and networking, digital signal processing, large-scale ASIC design and verification, silicon photonic integration, system software development, hardware design and high-speed electronics design. This broad expertise in a range of advanced technologies, methodologies and processes enhances our innovation, design and development capabilities and has enabled us to develop and introduce fourteen optical interconnect modules, six coherent DSP ASICs and three silicon PICs since 2009. In the course of our product development cycles, we continuously engage with our customers as they design their current and next-generation network equipment, which provides us with deep insights into the current and future market needs.
 We sell our products through a direct sales force to leading network equipment manufacturers. The number of customers who have purchased and deployed our products has increased from eight in 2011 to more than 25 during 2016. We have experienced rapid revenue and earnings growth over the last several years. Our revenue increased to $478.4 million in 2016 from $239.1 million in 2015, a year-over-year increase of 100%. Our revenue increased to $239.1 million in 2015 from $146.2 million in 2014, a year-over-year increase of 63%.  We generated net income of $131.6 million in 2016, $40.5 million in 2015, and $13.5 million in 2014.
 Industry Background 
 Growing Demand for Bandwidth and Network Capacity
 Global internet protocol, or IP, traffic is projected to nearly triple from 2.4 exabytes per day in 2015 to 6.4 exabytes per day in 2020, representing a 22% compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, according to Cisco’s Visual Networking Index Complete Forecast Highlights, dated June 2016, or the VNI Report. This rapid growth in IP traffic is the result of several factors, including:

• | Increased data and video consumption. Over the last decade, the proliferation of new technologies, applications, Web 2.0-based services and Internet-connected devices has led to increasing levels of Internet traffic and congestion and the need for greater bandwidth. Video traffic, in particular, is growing rapidly, and placing significant strains on network capacity. The VNI Report estimates that video traffic will represent 82% of all global IP traffic in 2020, reaching 158.9 exabytes per month, up from 51.0 exabytes per month in 2015. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growth in mobile and 4G/LTE communications. The increasing demand for data- and video-intensive content and applications on mobile devices is driving significant growth in mobile data and video traffic and has led to the proliferation of advanced wireless communication technologies, such as 4G/LTE, which depend on wired networks to

function. According to Cisco’s Visual Networking Index: Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, 2015-2020 White Paper, dated February 2016, global mobile data traffic grew 74% in 2015 from the prior year and is expected to increase nearly eight-fold from 2015 to 2020, a 53% CAGR.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proliferation of cloud services. Enterprises are increasingly adopting cloud services to reduce IT costs and enable more flexible operating models. Consumers are increasingly relying on cloud services to satisfy video, audio and photo storage and sharing needs. Together, these factors are driving increased Internet traffic as cloud services are accessed and used. Daily global cloud traffic is expected to quadruple from 10.7 exabytes in 2015 to 38.6 exabytes in 2020, according to the Cisco Global Cloud Index, dated November 2016. Forrester Research, in its report on Public Cloud Markets, released in September 2016, forecasts that the public cloud market will reach $236 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of 22% between 2015 and 2020. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changing traffic patterns. Content service providers and data center operators are increasingly building their own networks of connected data centers to handle increasing amounts of data. The architectures of these connected data centers dramatically increase the amount of data being transmitted within these data center networks. For example, Facebook found that a single 1 kB data inquiry generated 930 kB of traffic within its private data center network as reported in Facebook’s Data Center Network Architecture, an abstract from the proceedings of the IEEE Optical Interconnects Conference, published in May 2013. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adoption of the “Internet of Things.” Significant consumer, enterprise and governmental adoption of the “Internet of Things,” which refers to the global network of Internet-connected devices embedded with electronics, software and sensors, is anticipated to strain network capacity further and increase demand for bandwidth. The VNI Report estimates that 26.3 billion devices and objects will be connected to the Internet by 2020, compared to 16.3 billion in 2015. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Increasing Investment in Network Equipment
 To satisfy the growth in demand for bandwidth, communications and content service providers and data center and cloud infrastructure operators, which we refer to collectively as cloud and service providers, are investing in the capacity and performance of their network equipment. Network equipment can be broadly categorized as routing and switching networking equipment, which, among other things, manages data routing functions, and optical equipment, which transports data over the fiber optic network.
 The table below outlines the principal types of networks and estimated annual spend on high-speed optical network hardware related to the long-haul, metro and inter-data center markets, as described in the ACG 1H-2016 Worldwide Optical Infrastructure and Worldwide Data Center Interconnect (DCI) forecast, dated September 2016:
 
 
 | | Estimated Spend
------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+----------------
Network Type | Description | 2015 | Forecast for 2020 | CAGR | 
Long-haul | Distances greater than 1,500 km, and subsea connections | $4.6 billion | $6.9 billion | | 8.3% 
Metro | Distances less than 1,500 km connecting regions and cities | $6.1 billion | $9.6 billion | | 9.3% 
Inter-data center | Various lengths connecting large data centers | $1.3 billion | $4.2 billion | | 32.1%

 
Long-haul networks, which require sophisticated and high-capacity transmission capabilities, were traditionally the earliest adopters of high-speed optical technologies. Changing traffic patterns have also driven metro network operators and cloud and service providers to demand new technologies that can increase the capacity of their networks more rapidly. In addition, cloud infrastructure operators and content service providers have been building private networks of data centers, which are increasingly dependent on higher speed optical solutions to connect their data centers to each other.
 Importance of Optical Interconnect Technologies
 Optical equipment that interfaces directly with fiber relies on optical interconnect technologies that take digital signals from network equipment, perform signal processing to convert the digital signals to optical signals for transmission over the fiber network, and then perform the reverse functions on the receive side. These technologies also incorporate advanced signal processing that can monitor, manage and reduce errors and signal impairment in the fiber connection between the transmit and receive sides. Advanced

optical interconnect technologies can enhance network performance by improving the capabilities and increasing the capacities of optical equipment and routers and switches, while also reducing operating costs.
 The key characteristics of advanced optical interconnect technologies that dictate performance and capacity include:
  
• | Speed. Speed refers to the rate at which information can be transmitted over an optical channel and is measured in Gbps. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Density. Density refers to the physical footprint of the optical interconnect technology. Density is primarily a function of the size and power consumption of the technology. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Robustness. Robustness refers to the ability of an optical interconnect technology to compensate for the signal impairment that accumulates through the fiber network and prevent and correct errors introduced by the network. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Power Consumption. Power consumption refers to the amount of electricity an optical interconnect technology consumes. Lower power consumption permits improved density and product reliability, and results in lower operating expense for electricity and cooling. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Automation. Automation refers to the ability of an optical interconnect technology to handle network tasks that historically were required to be performed manually, such as activation and channel provisioning. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Manageability. Manageability refers to the ability of an optical interconnect technology to monitor network performance and detect and address network issues easily and efficiently, which helps increase reliability and reduce ongoing maintenance and operational needs. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As they build their network service offerings, cloud and service providers and network equipment manufacturers weigh these characteristics differently based on the particular demands and challenges they face. For example, cloud or service providers operating long-haul networks that transmit large amounts of data between Boston and San Francisco have relatively few connection points in their networks and may be more sensitive to speed and manageability of the optical interconnect and less focused on power consumption. In contrast, metro network operators or cloud or service providers operating inter-city or intra-city networks may face space and power constraints, as well as constantly changing workload needs, and be most focused on density, power consumption and automation.
 Improvements in these characteristics can lead to reductions in development costs for network equipment manufacturers, who might otherwise need to develop their own optical interconnect technologies. In addition, improvements in these characteristics can lead to reductions in acquisition and development costs for network equipment manufacturers who incorporate third-party optical interconnect technologies into their equipment, which in turn can reduce capital costs for cloud and service providers. Further, improvements in power consumption, automation and manageability can result in reduced operating costs for cloud and service providers.
 Coherent Interconnect Technologies
 Traditional techniques for transmitting information via light signals over a fiber optic network used simple “on/off” manipulation, or modulation, of the light signal. These traditional techniques are adequate for transmission speeds up to 10 Gbps, as separate optical equipment can be used to monitor the fiber connection and to compensate for the degradation of the light signals when they travel through the fiber. At transmission speeds in excess of 10 Gbps, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to compensate for the degradation of light signals using traditional techniques. In addition, these traditional techniques require cumbersome and expensive equipment and do not meet network operators’ demands for high-quality signals. In the mid-2000s, advanced modulation techniques enabled by coherent communications techniques and digital signal processing were introduced to increase transmission speeds above 10 Gbps. However, these advanced modulation techniques required significant changes in the underlying optical interconnect technologies and architecture.
 Coherent communications is a more complex method of transmitting and receiving information via optical signals. Coherent technologies enable greater utilization of complex formats that manipulate both a signal’s amplitude and its phase to yield a higher data transmission rate with better resilience to signal degradation. Coherent communications enables powerful digital signal processing to counter digitally the effects of signal degradation that were previously managed through an array of discrete components and costly techniques, such as optical dispersion compensation. By taking advantage of coherent communications technologies, some cloud and service providers are able to operate networks at transmission speeds of up to 400 Gbps today and are increasingly planning to adopt technologies that enable 1,000 Gbps and above transmission speeds. These providers require advanced coherent interconnect solutions.

Digital signal processing in coherent interconnect technologies takes place in an application-specific integrated circuit known as a coherent DSP ASIC. Building a coherent DSP ASIC is a multi-disciplinary undertaking requiring advanced knowledge of several complex technologies, such as optical systems, transmission, communications theory, digital signal processing algorithms and mixed signal design, and the development and verification of complex communications ASICs. To complete an interconnect solution, the coherent DSP ASIC must be used in conjunction with a number of photonic functions, such as modulation and transmission/reception. These functions have traditionally been performed by several discrete, bulky, expensive components that must be purchased by a network equipment manufacturer and designed into custom interface circuit boards before deployment. The development of a photonic integrated circuit, or PIC, enables dramatic improvements in size and cost by tightly integrating multiple photonic functions into a small integrated circuit.
 Our Solution—The Siliconization of Optical Interconnect Technology
 We have developed several families of high-speed coherent interconnect products that reduce the complexity and cost of optical interconnect technology, while simultaneously improving network performance and accelerating the pace of innovation in the optical networking industry. We build these advanced optical interconnect products using silicon, by converting optical interconnect technology to a silicon-based technology, a process we refer to as the siliconization of optical interconnect. The siliconization of optical interconnect allows us to integrate previously disparate optical functions into a single solution, leading to significant improvements in density and cost and allowing us to benefit from ongoing advances in CMOS. Our optical interconnect solution includes sophisticated modules that perform a majority of the digital signal processing and optical functions required to process network traffic at transmission speeds of 100 Gbps and above in long-haul, metro and inter-data center networks. Our modules meet the needs of cloud and service providers for optical interconnect products in a simple, open, high-performance form factor that can be easily integrated in a cost-effective manner with existing network equipment.
 Our optical interconnect products are powered by our internally developed and purpose-built coherent DSP ASICs and/or silicon PICs. Our coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs are engineered to work together, and each integrates numerous signal processing and optical functions that together deliver a complete, cost-effective high-speed coherent optical interconnect solution in a small footprint that requires low power and provides significant automation and management capabilities. We believe that our highly integrated optical interconnect modules, which are based on our coherent DSP ASIC and silicon PIC, were, at the time of market introduction, the industry’s first interconnect modules to deliver transmission speeds of 100 Gbps and higher. Prior to the introduction of our highly integrated optical interconnect modules, we believe that these transmission speeds were not possible in modules in an industry standard form factor without sacrificing signal quality or other performance characteristics. For example, our CFP and CFP2 DCO modules, which are based on the industry-standard CFP and CFP2 form factors, enable cloud and service providers to easily upgrade their existing metro and inter-data center networks to 100 Gbps and 200 Gbps using their existing, deployed equipment chassis or newly designed network equipment with CFP slot capabilities. Furthermore, by providing an integrated solution that incorporates digital signal processing and optical functionality required to process and transmit data through a high-speed optical channel, our optical interconnect products reduce the resource requirements of the network equipment manufacturers necessary to build and service equipment with high-speed optical interconnect functionality.
 We believe we were the first independent vendor to introduce at commercial scale both a coherent DSP ASIC and a silicon PIC integrated into an optical interconnect module. By designing our silicon PIC in a CMOS-compatible process, which is widely used in the semiconductor industry and generally does not require special packaging, we are able to reduce cost, increase reliability and take advantage of the ongoing improvement of CMOS technology, as well as contract with foundries for the manufacture of many of our products. Our silicon PIC incorporates several key optics functions, including modulation and transmission/reception functions, and supports transmission distances for long-haul, metro and inter-data center applications. We believe that our silicon PIC was the first commercially available PIC to include all of these functions over a broad range of transmission distances. By building both our coherent DSP ASIC and our silicon PIC in CMOS-compatible processes, we can improve the performance and efficiency of the optical interconnect and benefit from engineering synergies.
 The advantages of our solution include:
  
• | Industry-leading speed, density and power consumption. We believe that our coherent DSP ASICs, silicon PICs and 100 and 400 Gbps optical interconnect modules consume less power and have higher density than comparable optical interconnect products. Our modules perform functions that have traditionally been provided by several discrete pieces of network equipment. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Breadth of integration. By integrating many photonic functions into our silicon PIC and further integrating our silicon PIC in our modules, we enable simplified network equipment designs and reduce the amount of development and optical

engineering our customers would otherwise do internally, thereby freeing up their engineering resources to focus on other networking functions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Software intelligence. Our products incorporate software intelligence that automates tasks, such as channel provisioning, and increases manageability through a high level of software features, including increased monitoring and optimization.

• | Cost-efficiency. We are able to offer our products at attractive price points as a result of the scale and process benefits of our CMOS platforms. In addition, the performance capabilities of our products permit greater flexibility and can reduce both design cost for the network equipment manufacturer and network design and ongoing operational cost for the cloud or service provider. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of deployment. By leveraging industry-standard interfaces, our modules enable cloud and service providers to immediately increase the speed and capacity of their networks by replacing their legacy 10 Gbps or 40 Gbps components with our 100 Gbps or 400 Gbps modules in their existing equipment. Our modules can also easily be deployed in next generation network equipment. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths
 We plan to maintain and extend our competitive advantages through rapid innovation delivering industry-leading high-speed interconnect products to our customers by focusing on the following key areas:

• | Leading provider of high-speed integrated optical interconnect modules. We believe we were the first independent vendor to introduce at commercial scale both a coherent DSP ASIC and a silicon PIC integrated into an optical interconnect module capable of transmission speeds of 100 Gbps and above. Our modules solve many of the shortcomings of existing interconnect solutions and meet the majority of a cloud or service provider’s interconnect needs in a standard and compact form factor that can be easily integrated with other network equipment. Our coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs enable us to offer advanced optical interconnect products with desirable features such as high density, low power and high performance. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Track record of rapid innovation driven by advanced design methodologies. We maximize the pace of innovation through a number of measures, including the creation of an expanding tool box of digital signal processing algorithms, ASIC implementations, CMOS-compatible optics subsystems and related intellectual property, which enable us to develop complex products at an increasing pace by reusing and expanding existing solutions. Our development, verification and test infrastructure and methodologies involve extensive automation, which increase the speed and quality of our development. Our ability to innovate at a rapid pace enables us to offer products purpose-built for different applications and based on the newest CMOS technology. These design and development capabilities have enabled us to introduce fourteen optical interconnect modules since 2009 for multiple markets, including long-haul, metro and inter-data center. Using our innovation and development model, since 2009 we have introduced six coherent DSP ASICs, each of which was built using the newest CMOS technology available at the time of their market introduction, and three silicon PICs.

• | Leveraging the strength of CMOS for photonics. The density and cost of high-speed optical interconnect products have traditionally been determined by the photonic components. Implementing the photonic components in CMOS, and using CMOS as the platform for the integration of multiple discrete photonics functions, enables us to significantly reduce the density and cost of our optical interconnect products compared to traditional approaches, which typically rely on complex materials such as lithium niobate and indium phosphide that do not permit the same level of integration and do not benefit from the ongoing advances in CMOS technology driven by the entire electronics industry. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proprietary software framework enables simplified configuration and deployment. We have made substantial investments in the software components of our products, which we believe is key to increasing the performance and reducing the capital expenditures and operating expenses associated with high-speed networks. Our software framework also facilitates the integration of the many complex digital signal processing, ASIC, hardware and optical functions required in high-speed interconnect technologies and enables our customers to integrate our products easily into their existing networks. Through the use of software, we are able to configure the same product to be deployed in various network types with different needs and requirements, without the need to modify or reconfigure the network’s architecture, providing us with significant development and manufacturing efficiencies.

We collaborate closely with network equipment manufacturers, as well as directly with many cloud and service providers, and solicit their input as they design their network equipment and as we design our next-generation products. This provides us with deep insights into the current

and future needs of our customers and the market, which in turn enables us to develop and deliver products that meet customer demands and anticipate market developments.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong management and engineering teams with significant industry expertise. We have deliberately built our management and engineering teams, of which our founders remain a key part, to include personnel with extensive experience in optical systems and networking, digital signal processing, large-scale ASIC design and verification, silicon photonic integration, system software development, hardware design and high-speed electronics design. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 73% of our employees are engineers or have other technical backgrounds, and approximately 45% of our employees hold a Ph.D. or other advanced degree. Each element of our solution is developed by experts in the relevant field. Our collaborative development culture encourages employees with diverse experiences and expertise to work together to create innovative solutions.

Our Growth Strategy
 Our goal is to become the leading provider of high-speed interconnect technology that underpins the world’s data and communication networks. To grow our business and achieve our mission, we are pursuing the following strategies:

• | Continue to innovate and extend our technology leadership. Our coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs are at the heart of our products’ abilities to deliver cost-efficient high performance. We intend to continue to invest in our technology to deliver innovative and high-performance products and to identify and solve challenging interconnect needs. We expect that our continued investments in research and development will enable us to expand and enhance the capabilities of our CMOS-based products in order to continue to develop higher-capacity and higher-density software-enabled products. For example, we are currently developing optical interconnect modules that will enable transmission speeds of 1,000 Gbps and above. We also plan to continue to invest in silicon PIC innovation and its optimization with our coherent DSP ASICs in order to serve the growing demand for bandwidth. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase penetration within our existing customer base. We focus heavily on the needs of our customers and frequently innovate in partnership with them to deliver cost-effective products that meet their specific needs. As we continue to enhance and expand our product family, and as our existing customers seek to expand and improve their network equipment technology, we expect to generate additional revenue through sales of existing and new products to these customers. At the same time, we have designed many of our latest-generation products to interoperate with prior-generation products so that our customers can continue to derive long-term value from their investments. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to expand customer base. We have increased the number of customers who purchase and use our products in each of the last six years, and we believe there continues to be unmet need for high-speed, cost-efficient interconnect products among cloud and service providers. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold our optical interconnect products to more than 25 customers. Historically, our sales have been primarily to network equipment manufacturers that do not have internally developed coherent DSP ASICs. We have had success in marketing and selling our products to network equipment manufacturers that have internally developed their own coherent DSP ASICs. We believe that the benefits of our solution, supported by the success of existing customers as references, will drive more network equipment manufacturers to purchase their interconnect products from us. We plan to continue to acquire new customers through expanded sales and marketing and brand recognition efforts. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow into adjacent markets. We believe that growth in fiber optics-based communications is likely to accelerate, partly driven by the cost and density advantages of our CMOS solution, and that this growth, together with expansion in other markets that depend on high-speed networking capabilities, such as intra-data center and network access markets, will result in demand for additional applications for our products. By continuing to reduce the size, design complexity and power of the interconnect and the ease of integration into the equipment, we believe we can create opportunities to serve new types of customers that may seek to incorporate high-speed optical interconnect technologies into their products, including companies that do not have sufficient optical engineering expertise to develop systems using current interconnect technologies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively pursue strategic investments or acquisitions. Although we expect to focus our growth strategy on expanding our market share organically, we may pursue investments or acquisitions that complement our existing business, represent a strategic fit and are consistent with our overall growth strategy.

The period of time from our initial contact with a prospective or current customer to the receipt of an actual purchase order is frequently a year or more. Prospective customers perform system and network level testing before equipment is deployed in a network carrying live traffic. Customers require us to perform extensive verification testing and qualification based on industry standards. This phase of our sales cycle can take several months and purchase arrangements may not be entered into until after this phase is completed.
 We invest time and resources to meet with leading carriers and cloud service providers to understand network system performance issues. These efforts provide us with a deep understanding of the challenges faced by carriers and cloud service providers which, in turn, enables us to focus our future product and technology development efforts to address those challenges. For example, understanding that several of our customers are planning to adopt technologies that enable up to 1,000 Gbps and higher transmission speeds, we are currently developing products to satisfy these requirements.
 Our in-house sales personnel also assist customers with forecasts, orders, delivery requirements, and warranty returns. Our technical support engineers respond to technical and product-related questions, provide simulation tools to enable customers to optimize their optical link design, and provide application support to customers who have incorporated our products into their systems. In general, we have centralized our technical support operations at our corporate headquarters in Maynard, Massachusetts. Our centralized customer support operations allow our technical customer support personnel to work directly with our research and development and operations personnel on a regular basis, which reduces the time it takes to identify and address our customers’ technical issues and helps our technical support personnel maintain and improve upon their technical skills. We also provide technical support to our international customers from our offices in California and China.
 Customers
 The number of customers who have purchased and deployed our products has increased from eight in 2011 to more than 25 during 2016. The following table sets forth our revenue by geographic region for the periods indicated, based on the country or region to which the products were shipped:

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
--------------+-------------------------+--------

 Manufacturing
 We contract with third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our products. We utilize a range of CMOS and CMOS-compatible processes to develop and manufacture the coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs that are designed into our modules. We select the semiconductor process and foundry that provides the best combination of performance, cost and feature attributes necessary for our products. 
 We contract with three third-party contract manufacturers to test, build and inspect modules incorporating our coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs for high-volume production of our modules. Our contract manufacturers also implement many customer-specific configurations and packaging before customer shipments. We build the test systems used by our contract manufacturers. We also directly manufacture prototype products and limited production quantities during initial new product introduction.

We believe our outsourced manufacturing model enables us to focus our resources and expertise on the design, sale, support and marketing of our products to best meet customer requirements. We also believe that this manufacturing model provides us with the flexibility required to respond to new market opportunities and changes in customer demand, simplifies the scope of our operations and administrative processes and significantly reduces our working capital requirements, while providing the ability to scale production rapidly.
 We subject our third-party contract manufacturers and foundries to qualification requirements in order to meet the high quality and reliability standards required of our products. Our engineers and supply chain personnel work closely with third-party contract manufacturers and fab foundries to increase yield, reduce manufacturing costs, improve product quality and ensure that component sourcing strategies are in place to support our manufacturing needs.
 Research and Development
 Our engineering group has extensive experience in optical systems and networking, digital signal processing, ASIC development and design, silicon photonic integration, system software development and high-speed electronics design. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 73% of our employees are engineers or have other technical backgrounds, and approximately 45% of our employees hold a Ph.D. or other advanced degree. We utilize our hardware and software expertise to integrate coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs into high-speed interconnect products that are compatible with industry-standard form factor, interfaces and power consumption requirements. We participate in industry groups such as Optical Internetworking Forum to help drive the industry towards standardization that allows our customers to more easily integrate our products into their systems. In addition, we offer our integration expertise to our customers to help expedite their adoption of new products.
 We use simulation tools at many levels of product development, reducing the number of design errors and the need for costly and time consuming development cycles. Our simulation environment makes use of industry standard computer aided design tools as well as models and tools that are developed internally. Our simulation tools also allow us to make efficient tradeoffs between power consumption, size and performance early in the development cycle. We believe this contributes to the ability of our products to deliver superior performance with low power consumption.
 Our research and development facilities are located in Maynard, Massachusetts, Holmdel, New Jersey, San Jose, California, Ottawa, Canada, Bangalore, India and Wooburn Green, United Kingdom. We have devoted approximately 87,000 square feet of space to our research and development facilities, which we expect to increase in the future. Our research and development facilities are equipped with industry standard test equipment, including optical spectrum analyzers, high-speed sampling oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, wafer probes, wafer saws, optical network and Ethernet test sets, thousands of kilometers of optical fiber and associated optical amplifiers and other optical test equipment. We use these facilities to conduct comprehensive testing and validation procedures on internally produced chips, components and products before transferring production to our contract manufacturers for commercial, higher-volume manufacturing.
 As research and development is critical to our continuing success, we are committed to maintaining high levels of research and development over the long term. We incurred research and development expenses of $75.7 million, $38.6 million and $28.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our core technology and intellectual property rights. We rely on patent, trademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we generally require employees and consultants to execute appropriate non-disclosure and proprietary rights agreements. These agreements acknowledge our exclusive ownership of intellectual property developed for us and require that all proprietary information remain confidential.
 We maintain a program designed to identify technology that is appropriate for patent and trade secret protection, and we file patent applications in the United States and certain other countries for inventions that we consider significant. As of December 31, 2016, we had 57 patent applications pending in the United States, five patent applications pending under Patent Cooperation Treaty filings, two foreign patent applications, and 18 patents granted in the United States, which expire between 2027 and 2035. Although our business is not materially dependent upon any one patent, our patent rights and the products made and sold under our patents, taken as a whole, are a significant element of our business. In addition to patents, we also possess other intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, design rights and copyrights. We control access to and use of our software, technology and other proprietary information through internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors,

customers and partners. Our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright, patent and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our software, technology and other proprietary information, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology and other proprietary information. In addition, we have expanded our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
 Companies in the industry in which we operate frequently are sued or receive informal claims of patent infringement or infringement of other intellectual property rights. We have, from time to time, received such claims from companies, including from competitors and customers, some of which have substantially more resources and have been developing relevant technology for much longer than us. As we become more successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights. Successful claims of infringement by a third party, if any, could result in significant penalties or injunctions that could prevent us from selling some of our products in certain markets, result in settlements or judgements that require payment of significant royalties or damages or require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing products. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights.
 Competition
 The optical communications markets are highly competitive and rapidly evolving. We compete with domestic and international companies, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. We encounter substantial competition in most of our markets, although we believe we have few competitors that compete with us across all our product lines and markets. Our principal competitors in one or more of our product lines or markets include Finisar, Fujitsu Optical Components, Inphi, Lumentum Holdings, NEL, Neophotonics, Oclaro and Sumitomo Electric Industries. We also compete with internally developed coherent interconnect solutions of certain network equipment manufacturers, including Alcatel-Lucent (which was acquired by Nokia in January 2016), Ciena, Huawei, Cisco and Infinera. Consolidation in the optical systems and components industry has increased in recent years, and future consolidation could further intensify the competitive pressures that we face.
 The principal competitive factors upon which we compete include performance, low power consumption, rapid innovation, breadth of product line, availability, product reliability, multi-sourcing and selling price. We believe that we compete effectively by offering high levels of customer value through high speed, high density, low power consumption, broad integration of photonic functions, software intelligence for configuration, control and monitoring, cost-efficiency, ease of deployment and collaborative product design. We cannot be certain we will continue to compete effectively.
 We also may face competition from companies that may expand into our industry and introduce additional competitive products. Existing and potential customers are also potential competitors. These customers may internally develop or acquire additional competitive products or technologies, which may cause them to reduce or cease their purchases from us.

Government Regulation
 Our products and services are subject to export controls, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, and similar laws and regulations that apply in other jurisdictions in which we distribute or sell our products and services. Export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations include restrictions and prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services and on our transfer of parts, components, and related technical information and know-how to certain countries, regions, governments, persons and entities. For example, on March 8, 2016, the U.S. Department of Commerce published a final rule in the Federal Register that amended the Export Administration Regulations by adding ZTE Kangxun Telecom Co. Ltd., or ZTE, and three of its affiliates to the “Entity List,” for actions contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States. This rule imposed new export licensing requirements on exports, re-exports, and in-country transfers of all U.S.-regulated products, software and technology to the designated ZTE entities, which had the practical effect of preventing us from making any sales to ZTE. On March 24, 2016, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a temporary general license suspending the enhanced export licensing requirements for ZTE and one of its designated affiliates through June 30, 2016. On June 28, 2016, August 19, 2016, November 18, 2016 and February 23, 2017, the U.S. Department of Commerce extended the temporary general license, with the latest extension ending March 29, 2017. It is unclear whether the U.S. Department of Commerce will extend this temporary general license beyond the March 29, 2017 expiration date or permit sales to the designated ZTE entities after this temporary general license expires. There can be no guarantee that this or future regulatory activity would not materially interfere with our ability to make sales to ZTE or other customers. In addition, various countries regulate the importation of certain products, through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products. The exportation, re-exportation, transfers within foreign countries, and importation of our products, including by our partners, must comply with these laws and regulations.
 We are also subject to various domestic and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, as well as other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering or making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining, retaining or directing business. Our exposure for violating these laws and regulations increases as our international presence expands and as we increase sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions.
 In addition, we are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate or sell our products. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, employee health and safety and the use of hazardous materials in, and the recycling of, our products.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we employed 290 full-time employees, consisting of 142 in research and development, 71 in operations, which includes manufacturing, supply chain, quality control and assurance, and 77 in executive, sales, general and administrative, and seven part-time employees. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
