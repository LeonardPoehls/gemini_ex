ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

History and Development of Vegalab, Inc.
 
Vegalab, Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”), was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 2006 as HPC Acquisitions, Inc. The Company operates in two segments of the food industry. One involves the manufacture and distribution of all-natural crop protection, crop health, and soil enhancement products, and the other is the operation of a citrus packing facility.
Crop Protection and Soil Enhancement Business
 
In March of 2016, the Company acquired from Vegalab SA, Switzerland (“VSA”), the exclusive North and South America distribution rights to a suite of products which includes biological pesticides, natural fertilizers, and specialty biological products marketed under the “Vegalab” brand. Vegalab’s crop protection products consist of natural agents that are highly effective against targeted organisms, non-toxic to beneficial organisms, and safe for the environment (the “Agronomy Business”). The Company markets its products through stocking distributors, and holds registrations for its products in a number of US states, Costa Rica, and Panama. We are actively pursuing additional registrations domestically, and in Canada, Mexico, and Latin America. The Company began distributing Vegalab products in April of 2016. For calendar year 2017, the Agronomy Business generated $361,083 in revenue compared to $2,115,421 in 2016.
Citrus Packing Business
 
In October of 2017, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets related to a produce packing business located in Tulare County, California (the "Packing Business"). The acquisition included approximately 11 acres of real property and 30,000 sq. ft. of buildings from M&G Farms, Inc., a California corporation, and all of the equipment, inventory, customers, suppliers, contract rights, and intangible property from M&G Packing, Inc., a California corporation that operated the Packing Business. The total purchase price for the Packing Business, including closing costs, was $854,452. The Company purchased the Business with $425,000 cash and an 18-month promissory note bearing interest at 6% per annum. The Packing Business, located in the middle of a citrus growing region near Fresno, CA, has been packing citrus (mainly oranges and lemons) for about 13 years, and is being operated as M&G Packing, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. For calendar year 2017, the Packing Business generated $2,130,308 in revenue.
 
The Company acquired the Packing Business as a part of its long term plan to grow both organically and through strategic acquisitions. With several customers of the Packing Business already using Vegalab's all natural products to maximize yields and increase the number of premium quality fruits produced in their citrus groves, we believe this acquisition will produce synergistic growth for both our Packing Business and our Agronomy Business.
 
Recent Development
 
In February of 2018, the Company acquired The Agronomy Group, LLC, a California limited liability company (“TAG”), a producer and distributor of environmentally friendly agrochemicals. TAG had been our top U.S. sales organization, so the acquisition significantly expanded the Company’s internal marketing capabilities. Furthermore, the TAG product line complemented the existing Vegalab product line, and thus increased the number of products that we have available to offer our customers. The purchase price for TAG was paid by the delivery of 600,000 shares of restricted common stock of Vegalab, and a warrant to purchase 1,600,000 shares of restricted common stock of Vegalab at an exercise price of $1.20 per share exercisable over a term of five years.
The Market Opportunity
 
The world agricultural landscape is changing rapidly, as consumers demand foods produced from plants that are sustainably grown without synthetic chemicals, and from animals that are humanely raised, fed natural diets, and grown without inputs such as antibiotics and growth hormones. According to an online report issued by Organic Authority, for example, consumer pressure has compelled 57 major food companies to commit to switching to the use of cage-free eggs. In another report, this one issued by TechSci Research, the global market for organic food is projected to grow at a compounded rate of 14% per year through 2021. We believe the number of food manufacturers looking to eliminate synthetic inputs from the food ingredients in their supply chain will continue to grow as the demand for natural food products intensifies.

In addition to increasing consumer pressure to minimize chemical residues in food, regulatory restrictions and outright bans on the use of certain chemical compounds in the food chain are driving the growing demand from large scale agricultural businesses for eco-friendly fertilizers, bio-pesticides and specialty biological agents like the Company’s. According to a report published by Research and Markets, the projected global market for bio-pesticides alone is estimated to reach $8.82 billion by the year 2022, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 17.6% from 2016.
 
The convergence of changing consumer preferences, increased regulation, and the commitment of food companies to reduce chemical compounds in the environment in their supply chain has created what management believes is a substantial opportunity for growth in the distribution of Vegalab products.
 
Our Products
 
Our product line in 2017 consisted of natural fertilizers, specialty biological agents, and biological pesticides, that are highly effective against targeted organisms, non-toxic to beneficial organisms, and safe for the environment.
 The following products are registered in one or more jurisdictions and available for sale:
 

Biological Control Agents Soil Inoculants | Insecticides | Fungicides 
------------------------------------------+-------------------------+------------------------
Larva BioControl | Nematode Control | Mildew Control 
Myco BioBoost | Mosquito BioControl | Spore Control 
 | Spider Mite Control |

Kelp Boost (0-0-1) | Potassium Pro (0-20-26) | 
Magnesium Boost (4-0-0) | Rigid Boost (1-4-4) | 

 
These products are “natural” in that the active ingredients consist primarily of oil extracts from various plant sources. The efficacy of the raw material is effectuated and enhanced through a process of micronization, nano-encapsulation, and amplification. These special processes in manufacturing improve the product efficacy to a commercial level for large agricultural enterprises. Our fertilizers have unique formulations containing organic compounds that facilitate the absorption of minerals, increase growth rates, and enhance overall crop quality. The fertilizers we offer are formulated to reduce their chemical footprint and to increase absorption into the plant. With our product formulations, the applicator is able to use smaller amounts of fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, etc. to achieve similar crop results to those achieved using the standard synthetic products currently on the commercial market.
 
Distribution Agreement
 
The Company has the exclusive right to market and sell the Vegalab products in the Western Hemisphere. David Selakovic, a director, officer, and principal stockholder of the Company, assigned this exclusive distribution right to the Company in March 2016. Mr. Selakovic held the distribution rights under a distribution agreement dated October 19, 2012, with ECOWIN Co., Ltd., a Korean company that owns the intellectual property related to the processes for manufacturing the Vegalab products and manufactures products the Company sells. Additions, removals, and modifications of the Vegalab products may be made at the discretion of ECOWIN. ECOWIN is required to provide 90-days advance notice of the discontinuation of a product. For a new product, ECOWIN is required to provide 30-days advance notice of the addition of the new product, and during that period the Company has the right to decline the addition of the product to the distribution agreement.

VSA is a Swiss company of which David Selakovic is the sole owner, and it is the world-wide distributor of the Vegalab products we offer, subject to the exclusive rights of the Company in the Western Hemisphere. At the present time we purchase all of our products from VSA at its cost.
 
VSA publishes a product price list periodically, which lists the distributor price to the Company for all product ordered through VSA. Prices are FOB (Freight on Board) the factory. Pricing is subject to change at any time at the election of VSA on 30-days advance written notice to the Company. Payment is made in US Dollars by irrevocable letter of credit issued at the time of the order and payable 90 days from the date of the bill of lading.
 
The Company has a duty to use all reasonable commercial efforts to develop and exploit the maximum sales for the entire line of products covered by the distribution agreement. This includes the obligation to:
 

· | Establish a trained sales force;
--+---------------------------------


· | Purchase and maintain an adequate selection and stock of products to meet reasonably expected demand;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Deliver monthly sales reports;
--+-------------------------------


· | Advertise and promote the products, including participation in trade shows; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Obtain and maintain all governmental permits or registrations required to market and sell the products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Under the distribution agreement, products we purchase for resale are warranted by the manufacturer to be free of defects in material and workmanship for a period of 24 months. At its discretion, the manufacturer may replace or repair defective products, or issue a refund of the purchase price.
 
Distributing Our Products
 
We began distribution of our Vegalab products in April 2016, after aggressively pursuing registration of Vegalab products in jurisdictions where we believed there was an opportunity to commence sales soon after registrations were achieved. This strategy proved effective, with initial sales occurring primarily to large growers in California, and to an OEM customer for products packaged in retail consumer sized packaging. These efforts resulted in approximately $2.1 million in total product sales in 2016. Sales in 2017 slowed until the fourth quarter, due to a combination of adverse weather in California, and our customers using products carried over from purchases in mid to late 2016. During 2017 The Agronomy Group (TAG) was retained as the Company’s main sales organization for the California market, and TAG organized and supervised several successful trials during the growing season of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, through TAG’s efforts, the Company began selling its products through two of the twenty-five largest agricultural retailers in the United States (according to the "CropLife Top 100" rankings), Buttonwillow Warehouse Company, Inc. ("Buttonwillow") and Mid Valley Agricultural Services, Inc. ("Mid Valley Ag").
 
The successful trials and product sales to customers of Buttonwillow and Mid Valley Ag attracted the attention of Stanislaus Farm Supply (“Stanislaus”), which is a member of Winfield United. Stanislaus placed its first order in the fourth quarter 2017 and proceeded to sign a distribution agreement with TAG. The agreement has an effective date of November 1, 2017, with Stanislaus committing to purchase at least $13 million annually of Vegalab products. Although total sales to Stanislaus (through TAG, our distributor at the time) only slightly exceeded $500,000 in 2017, we believe we are well positioned for a significant increase in annual sales in 2018.
 
We also believe there are numerous additional markets in North and Latin America where we can sell our Vegalab products, and that we are only just beginning to penetrate the large market available to us. We are focusing our efforts on jurisdictions where major distributors or government agencies have indicated they believe a strong need for our products exists. We have begun conducting product tests in some of these areas, several of which have already been completed with very positive results, and more are in the pipeline. We hope to negotiate several new distribution agreements in 2018 in these jurisdictions, and expect product sales there to be cyclical, based on growing seasons and other factors. We are currently pursuing opportunities in Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Mexico.

Competition
 
Our Vegalab products compete with similar products produced by other agrochemical businesses, as well as with traditional agrochemicals. Many large manufacturers of synthetic agro-chemicals are entering the race to produce “earth friendly” agro-chemicals. These competitors have well established products, brands, market share, and have much greater financial and operational resources than we do. Being the new entrant in what is expected to be a multi-billion dollar industry creates significant challenges, and there is no assurance we can compete effectively on the basis of product content and performance, or on price. However, we believe our eco-friendly products have an advantage over traditional agro-chemicals because of testing and reports show that many traditional agro-chemicals, particularly synthetic pesticides and some fertilizers, degrade the environment and are potentially harmful to humans. This results in higher regulatory scrutiny and restrictions, as well as potential liability under federal and local laws. We believe the absence of these negative characteristics in our eco-friendly products make them very appealing to potential distributors and end users, and gives us an advantage we can promote when competing with traditional agro-chemicals.
Regulatory Considerations
 
Our activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations. These regulations may prevent us or our collaborators from developing or commercializing products in a timely manner or under technically or commercially feasible conditions, and may impose expenses, delays and other impediments to our product development and registration efforts. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) regulates our bio-based pest management products under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (“FFDCA”) and the Food Quality Protection Act (“FQPA”). In addition, our fertilizers are regulated as fertilizers or biostimulants in each of the fifty states.
 
In 2004, the United States Congress passed the Pesticide Registration Improvement Renewal Act, which was reauthorized in 2007 and 2012, a result of efforts from an industry coalition of pesticide companies and environmental groups, to codify pesticide approval times in return for user fees. This law facilitates faster approval times for biopesticides, with EPA approvals typically received within 16 to 24 months, compared with 36 months or longer for conventional chemical pesticides. Registration processes for state and foreign governments vary between jurisdictions and can take up to 12 months for state governments, such as California and New York, and up to 36 months or more for foreign governments. In some instances, California and Canada will conduct joint reviews with the EPA, which allows some pesticides to receive concurrent approvals in California, Canada and the United States. However, in most instances, most foreign government submissions will not occur until after a U.S. registration has been secured. To register a crop protection product with the EPA, companies must demonstrate the product is safe to mammals, non-target organisms, endangered species and the environment. To demonstrate the bio-based pest management product’s safety, required studies must be conducted that evaluate mammalian toxicology, toxicological effects to non-target organisms in the environment (ecotoxicological exposures) and physical and chemical properties of the product. The registration dossier is subject to both scientific and administrative reviews by EPA scientists and management before registration approval. The scientific review involves thorough evaluation of submitted data and completion of risk assessments for human dietary and ecotoxicological exposures. Upon completion of this process, the registration package, including the proposed label, is sent to the Office of General Council for legal review. The final step in the registration process is administrative sign-off by the EPA director of the Biopesticides and Pollution Prevention Division.
 
In addition to EPA approval, we are required to obtain regulatory approval from the appropriate state regulatory authority in individual states and foreign regulatory authorities before we can market or sell any pest management product in those jurisdictions. Foreign governments typically require up to two seasons of locally generated field efficacy data on crop-pest combinations before a product dossier can be submitted for review. California and foreign jurisdictions also require us to submit product efficacy data, which the EPA historically has not required, but may request.
 
We engage third party contractors with experience in the regulatory registration processes of federal and local governments to assist us with obtaining regulatory approvals and permits for our products.

Since our plant fertilizers are not used to control pests, they currently fall outside the legal scope of FIFRA, FFDCA and FQPA and, therefore, we do not need to submit applications for EPA registrations for such products. However, we must still submit state registrations for our fertilizers, and those containing microbes of foreign origin may also need to be “deregulated” (or determined not to be a plant pest) under the Plant Protection Act by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service prior to use in field trials or for large scale release. Nevertheless, the regulatory process is significantly accelerated compared to that for bio-pesticides.
 
Annex I to this report is a current list of the government registrations we have obtained for our products.
 
Acquisition of the Vegalab Business
 
On March 8, 2016, the Company issued 12,011,000 shares of common stock to David Selakovic at a total purchase price of $303,100, paid in cash. Concurrently, Mr. Selakovic was appointed a director, and to the positions of Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer. Craig S. Laughlin, the former Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Financial Officer, remained a director and serves as the President and Secretary of the Company. In connection with the foregoing investment and changes in management, Mr. Selakovic assigned to the Company certain assets consisting of (a) the exclusive right to distribute in the Western Hemisphere natural agrochemicals marketed under the name “Vegalab” and manufactured by ECOWIN Co., Ltd., a Korean company, (b) certain governmental permits for the sale of ECOWIN agrochemicals, and (c) the trademark “Vegalab.” As a result of the foregoing transactions the Company acquired distribution rights to the Vegalab products, permits related to those products, a trademark, and cash to commence the business of selling Vegalab products.
 
During the two-year period prior to the investment by Mr. Selakovic in the Company, we were classified as a “shell company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), seeking to acquire or develop a business opportunity.
 
Employees
 
Vegalab. had no full time employees in 2017. The executive officers, CEO David Selakovic and President and Secretary Craig Laughlin served in 2017 without direct financial compensation. Craig Laughlin received options in recognition of his contributions in 2017. Approximately ten contractors served in various roles to support the following business functions: logistics, sales, agricultural analysis and consulting, legal, accounting, and technology.
 
In October, 2017, Vegalab expanded its work force with the acquisition of the Packing Business. By December 31, 2017, the Packing Business engaged 40 workers through staffing companies.
