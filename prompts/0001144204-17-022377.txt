Item 1. Business
Our Business
 
We are an apparel and lifestyle brand company that is currently focused on innerwear products for women and men. Under our flagship brand name and registered trademark “Naked®”, we design, manufacture and sell men’s and women’s underwear, intimate apparel, loungewear and sleepwear through retail partners and direct to consumer through our online retail store www.wearnaked.com. We have a growing retail footprint for our innerwear products in premium department and specialty stores and internet retailers in North America, including accounts such as Nordstrom, Dillard’s, Bloomingdale’s, Amazon.com, Soma.com, SaksFifthAvenue.com, barenecessities.com and others.
 
The Naked brand was founded on one basic desire: to create a new standard for how products worn close to the skin fit, feel and function. Our core brand philosophy for Naked is “the freedom to be you” and we endeavor to provide products that help people feel confident, attractive and empowered while being as comfortable as wearing nothing at all. The Naked brand was founded in Vancouver, Canada in 2010, as a men’s underwear manufacturer. In 2014 we relocated our headquarters to New York City, expanded our men’s collections and developed women’s intimate apparel, sleepwear and loungewear collections. Our first women’s sleep and loungewear collections became available for retail sale online at www.wearnaked.com in September 2015 and at retail locations and other online retailers in February 2016. Also in February 2016, we launched our women’s intimate apparel products. In September 2016, we launched our first collections of Wade X Naked, a signature collection of men’s innerwear developed in collaboration with NBA Champion Dwyane Wade. In the future, we intend to expand the Naked brand through existing channels and through licensing partnerships into other apparel and product categories that exemplify the mission of our brand, such as athleisure apparel, swimwear, sportswear, hosiery, bedding and home products and others.
 
Our expansion into the women’s sleepwear and intimate apparel in fiscal 2017 is a key part of our growth strategy given that these market segments represent $17.8 billion, or over 77% of the overall innerwear market according to data from the NPD Group. Daywear products that address consumer demand for versatile “athleisure” apparel have been the fastest growing segment of the women’s market. Our ability to attract women customers for the Naked brand is also very important to our effort to penetrate the men’s $4.3 billion U.S. innerwear market since a number of consumer research reports show that women purchase as much as 50% of men’s underwear for their husbands, boyfriends or sons.
 
We have a collaboration and endorsement agreement with NBA Champion Dwyane Wade, whereby Mr. Wade has agreed to act as a spokesperson for our brand. Mr. Wade also sits on our corporate Advisory Board. Further, he acts as Creative Director for our Wade X Naked signature collection of men’s innerwear, which became available for retail purchase in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. This collection encompasses primarily underwear as well as undershirts and loungewear for men.
 
Our products currently target men and women who are fashion and performance conscious, care about innovation and contemporary design, and desire comfort, quality and fit in their innerwear and apparel. We aim to provide an affordable luxury product for the successful and aspirational customer that enjoys the qualities of a premium garment at a price they feel delivers value. With growing awareness of our brand among these consumers and a broadening array of products, we expect to continue to expand our retail distribution through department stores, boutiques, online retail channels, hotels, spas, and other retailing channels over the next two years and beyond. We plan to also grow our direct to consumer business primarily through our online retail store, www.wearnaked.com, through which we will continue to commercially introduce new products as well as feature certain products, collections and styles exclusively.

Potential Business Combination with Bendon Limited 
 
On December 19, 2016, we entered into a letter of intent (the “LOI”), with Bendon Limited an intimate apparel company based in New Zealand (“Bendon”), for a proposed business combination of the companies. The LOI became binding on us on January 12, 2017 upon entry into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated January 12, 2017, by and among us and certain investors. The business combination is subject to the parties entering into a definitive agreement governing such transaction and the satisfaction of various closing conditions that will be contained therein. There is no assurance that the parties will enter into the definitive agreement or that the transaction will be consummated.
 
On February 9, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “First Amendment”) to the LOI with Bendon. The First Amendment (i) extended the date, from February 10, 2017 to March 10, 2017, by which the parties shall have entered a definitive agreement regarding the business combination before certain penalties may be incurred; (ii) adjusted the Net Asset Amount (as defined in the Amendment) to $1.359 million, which amount would be adjusted as a result of any additional capital transactions as agreed to between us and Bendon, and is used to determine, in part, the extent to which the number of shares of our common stock proposed to be issued to Bendon in the business combination would be adjusted; and (iii) amended certain other terms and conditions of the LOI.
 
On March 9, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 2 (the “Second Amendment”) to the LOI with Bendon. The Second Amendment, among other things, revised the proposed structure of the business combination with Bendon. As contemplated by the Second Amendment, we will now merge with and into a subsidiary of a newly formed Australian holding company (“NewCo”) which will be the ultimate parent company of Bendon and us (the “Merger”). The Second Amendment contemplates that, upon consummation of the Merger, NewCo would issue to the current holders of the outstanding capital stock of Bendon an aggregate of 118,812,163 ordinary shares of NewCo (the “Bendon Shares”) and issue to us a number of ordinary shares of NewCo equal to the number of shares of outstanding common stock of Naked (the “Naked Shares”) immediately prior to the Merger, and as of the effective time of the Merger, no other shares of NewCo will be outstanding. Shares issued to Bendon would be subject to adjustment based on us having Net Assets (as defined in the Amendment) of $786,246, which amount will be adjusted as a result of any subsequent capital transactions agreed to by us and Bendon. In connection with the closing of the Merger, NewCo’s shares must be approved for listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market.
 
Further, in connection with the LOI and the Second Amendment, we (i) appointed two new directors to our board of directors, Mr. Edward Hanson and Mr. Justin Davis-Rice; (ii) we agreed to adhere to a no-shop provision until the earlier of the date the Merger Agreement (as defined below) is executed or the LOI is terminated, and (iii) agreed to issue 2.5 million shares of common stock to Bendon in the event the Merger Agreement is not executed by April 10, 2017, as such date may be extended, or the Merger is not consummated within six months thereafter (each a “Merger Milestone”); provided, however, that we shall not be required to issue Bendon such shares if Bendon’s action(s) or lack thereof has been the principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the parties to achieve a Merger Milestone.
 
On April 10, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 3 (the “Third Amendment”) to the LOI with Bendon. The Third Amendment (i) extends the date by which the parties shall have entered into the Merger Agreement from April 10, 2017 to May 26, 2017; (ii) revises the Net Asset Amount to $5.8 million, which amount will be adjusted as a result of any subsequent capital transactions agreed upon between the parties; and (iii) amends certain other terms of the LOI, including increasing the number of shares of NewCo to be issued to the holders of the outstanding capital stock of Bendon to 146,311,063.
 
Except as amended by the First Amendment, Second Amendment, and Third Amendment, all other material terms of the LOI remain in full force and effect.
 
Completion of the Merger remains subject to the negotiation of a definitive merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”), satisfaction of the conditions negotiated therein and approval of the Merger by the Company’s stockholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a Merger Agreement will be entered into or that the proposed Merger will be consummated. Those portions of the LOI, as amended, that describe the proposed Merger, including the consideration to be issued therein, are non-binding.

Principal Products
 
Historically, we were strictly a men’s innerwear manufacturer and retailer and our men’s collections represents substantially all of our revenues until the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Our Fall 2015 women’s sleep and loungewear collection became available for retail sale online at www.wearnaked.com in September 2015 and at retail locations and other online retailers in February 2016. Also in February 2016, we launched our women’s intimate apparel products online and at select retailers. Our women’s collections have seen strong growth and represents approximately half of our revenues for fiscal 2017.
Men’s Collections 
 
We currently offer a variety of innerwear products for men including boxer briefs, trunks, briefs, undershirts, t-shirts, lounge pants, lounge shorts and robes. Our three primary men’s collections are: Luxury, Active and Essential. Our men’s Luxury collection utilizes MicroModal fabric, which is a lightweight, highly soft fabric that has breathable moisture-wicking qualities and made using a carbon-neutral, eco-friendly process. Our Active collection is based on a high-performance Microfiber fabric, a nylon-based textile that is smooth and resilient while providing moisture-wicking properties. We have been producing our full line of men’s underwear using these fabrics since the inception of our business. Our Essential collection is made of Cotton Stretch fabric for a light, comfortable everyday fit. Underwear and undershirts in this collection are sold in 2-packs to access a broader customer base.
 
We also offer men’s products in other fabrics including Microfiber with X-Static® Silver, French Terry, Modal Cotton and Tencel. All of the fabrics we use are readily available in many countries. Additionally, we produce boxer briefs and V-neck t-shirts with microfiber using X-Static® Silver, a high-performance fabric, which helps regulate body temperature and provides anti-odor and antimicrobial protection. X-Static® Silver fabric contains 99.9% pure silver woven into the garment’s nylon threads, which naturally deters odor-causing bacteria, wicks away moisture, is anti-chaffing and naturally cooling.
 
During fiscal 2017, we expanded our Essentials collection to include loungewear in Peruvian Pima Cotton, a superior cotton that is prized for its softness and breathability. We also introduced a new product called the Naked Shield™ which incorporates special fabric featuring Circuitex technology that provides wireless shielding and antimicrobial/anti-odor properties.
 
In addition to our existing men’s collections, we also produce the Wade X Naked collection for men which includes two groups of underwear, undershirts, lounge pants and shorts, and robes. Like our core men’s collection, these groups utilize high performance fabrics and innovative design and construction to create exceptional product look, feel and comfort.
 
Women’s Collections
 
Our women’s loungewear and sleepwear collections are based on two of the same fabrics used in our collections for men: Luxury Micromodal and Essential Cotton Stretch. Our three primary women’s collections are: Luxury, Everyday and Essential. These women’s collections include a range of products such as boyshorts, hipsters, lounge pants, camisoles, tank tops, pajamas, chemises and sleepshirts. We also make French terry robes, Alpaca throws, as well as Double Gauze woven cotton sleepwear. True to our brand mission, we believe these designs deliver superior fit, feel and function with timeless looks and at premium affordable prices that make them appealing to a broad consumer market.
 
Our Everyday collection consists of three core groups of daily essentials including wire-free bralettes and thong, modern brief and hipster style panties meant for everyday use for a range of different occasions. Everyday Naked, is constructed from Peruvian Pima cotton stretch fabric that is designed to be ultra-light, soft and breathable. Naked Luxury intimates, is made from soft MicroModal fabric with 360-degree stretch that is designed to naturally wick away moisture and be cool to the touch. We have designed our intimate apparel collection according to our mission to deliver the highest standard of fit, feel, function and look for the modern active woman.

Our Essential collection consists of pajamas, sleepshirts, robes, loungewear, yogawear and chemises made from Peruvian Pima Cotton for everyday comfort and style.
 
Distribution
 
We sell our products through wholesale relationships and through direct to consumer channels. The wholesale channel is currently our largest channel and consists of department stores as well as boutique apparel stores and undergarment stores. Our two largest distribution partners are Nordstrom, which carries our products in select stores in North America and its online store, Nordstrom.com, and Bloomingdales, which carries our product at select stores in the U.S. We also sell our products through Dillard’s, Soma.com, SaksFifthAvenue.com and a growing number of boutiques and specialty stores. We are targeting additional key retail store partners in the U.S. in 2017 for our men’s and women’s products. In addition to selling in key department stores in North America, Naked also sells through online stores such as Amazon.com, barenecessities.com, hackberry.com, hisroom.com and freshpair.com.
 
We also sell all of our products direct-to-consumer through our internet retail store, www.wearnaked.com. Our internet retail store is optimized for use on all online platforms and provides our customers with a premium online shopping experience and access to our entire product line. Our direct-to-consumer channel has become an increasingly significant part of our business and we expect it will continue to do so as our brand awareness increases in North America and internationally. We believe that the availability of online sales is convenient for our customers and enhances the image of our brand, making our brand and products more accessible in more markets than in brick and mortar stores alone. We plan to commercially introduce new products at www.wearnaked.com as well as feature certain products, collections and styles exclusively.
 
Production
 
We utilize manufacturing partners outside of the United States to produce our products. Currently, our primary production is in China although we have limited production in India and Peru and may expand into other territories in 2017.
 
We believe we have developed good relationships with a number of our vendors and we seek to ensure that they share our commitment to quality and ethics. We do not have any long-term agreements requiring us to use any manufacturer. Our primary production partner during fiscal 2017 has been TMS Fashion, a wholly owned subsidiary of LuenThai Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong Stock Exchange-listed company. We began working with TMS and LuenThai in 2014 in an effort to streamline and scale up our production capabilities by leveraging a large, established manufacturing resource. We believe this partnership allows us access to “best-in-class” fabrics, materials and manufacturing techniques while reducing our need for fixed overhead. Further, we sublet our principal office location in New York City from Tellas, Inc., another wholly-owned subsidiary of LuenThai operating in the U.S. We have additional manufacturing relationships for our women’s intimate apparel collections and expect to work with additional manufacturers as we expand our product offering.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
Raw materials, which include fabric and accessories, are sourced from all over the world, including Italy, Turkey, China, Peru, India and Bangladesh. We believe these fabrics and raw materials are readily available from multiple sources. Currently, we work closely with TMS Fashion and LuenThai, who are responsible for all of the sourcing of our raw materials for our men’s and women’s collections. We have additional sourcing relationships for our women’s intimate apparel collections and we expect to work with additional sourcing partners as we expand our product offering.
Key Customers
 
In fiscal 2017, sales were concentrated with Bloomingdales and Nordstrom, which accounted for 14% and 12%, respectively of our net sales. During fiscal 2016, Nordstrom accounted for 41% of our net sales. The decline in percentage of sales to Nordstrom during fiscal 2017 is partly due to a reduction by Nordstrom in replenishment orders due to the elimination by them of in-store inventory, but more significantly is due to the addition of other key departments store and specialty store accounts, and the corresponding increase in overall net sales. Nordstrom and Bloomingdales are currently of key importance to our business and our results of operations, which would be materially adversely affected if these relationships ceased to exist or are significantly reduced. These customers do not have ongoing purchase commitments with us nor do any of our other customers. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the volume of sales will remain consistent going forward. We typically enter into agreements with department store and larger retail customers which cover the material terms and conditions of purchase orders such as shipping terms, pricing policies, payment terms and cancellation policies. We are targeting additional department store and retail customers to become additional key accounts of our business in fiscal 2018 and beyond.

Marketing
 
Our marketing strategy is primarily focused on digital and social media marketing aimed at increasing brand awareness and helping drive sales growth cost-efficiently. We have engaged consultants, where necessary, to provide marketing advisory and execution services to our company, including assistance with brand management, public relations, celebrity alignment, strategic retail placement, manufacturing strategy, and strategic and creative development and assistance. We intend to continue to grow our investment in marketing and brand awareness-building activities, including internet and media marketing to consumers and retailers, attendance at apparel trade shows and exploration of other strategic marketing opportunities.
Competition
 
Men’s and women’s innerwear is a very competitive market with many high profile undergarment manufacturers such as, Calvin Klein, Polo Ralph Lauren, 2(x)ist, Hugo Boss, Tommy John, Saxx Giorgio Armani, Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors, DKNY, Natori, Free People, Hanky Panky, Commando, Cosabella, MeUndies, Bread&Boxers, Frigo and others. We believe there are currently over 100 potential competitors in our market sector for men’s and women’s undergarments, lounge and sleepwear, and intimate apparel. The market includes increasing competition from established companies who are expanding their production and marketing of undergarments, as well as frequent new entrants. We are in direct competition with such companies. Competition is principally on the basis of brand image and recognition, as well as product quality, innovation, style, distribution and price. We believe that we have the potential to perform well against competition as a result of the quality, fit and performance of our products, our brand and brand strategy and positioning, our planned marketing and consumer engagement initiatives, and through brand endorsement and strategic collaboration agreements, such as our partnership with Wade. The products we have introduced to market and the products we plan to introduce are targeted at a premium consumer value point, which means retailing a high quality product at a competitive price to comparable products, which we believe gives us the opportunity to penetrate the market successfully.
 
We believe our competitive advantages include promoting that our products are as comfortable as wearing nothing at all, which leverages our brand name, and retailing high quality products at a competitive price with superior fit, feel, function and look. We also believe our brand name and brand mission and philosophy will be an important competitive differentiator as we expand our marketing and brand awareness initiatives. However, many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, larger and broader customer bases, more established relationships with a broader set of suppliers, greater brand recognition and greater financial, research and development, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do. Our competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness and market share more quickly and effectively than we can.
 
Seasonality of Business
 
The apparel industry is generally subject to seasonality of buying which can affect revenue and cash flows. For men, there are generally two distinct buying seasons in the apparel industry: Fall/Winter season, which occurs in the third to fourth quarters of our fiscal year and Spring/Summer season, which occurs in the first to second quarters of our fiscal year, with some potential shipments at the last quarter. The women’s apparel buying markets are more frequent than men’s, although we may elect to focus only on two main buying markets as we do for men’s products in order to optimize design and production cycles. In fiscal 2017, the largest revenues were reported in our third and fourth fiscal quarters, arising from seasonal products and sales, and the launch of new collections (as described in this Form 10-K under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”). As a result of growth and changes to our business with the introduction of new product lines during the fiscal year, the natural seasonality of our business had a reduced effect. Furthermore, with limited operating history it is difficult to anticipate the effects of seasonality moving forward. Thus, historical quarterly operating trends may not be indicative of future performance because of new product launches and continued early stage sales growth.

Intellectual Property
 
The “Naked” trademark is a critical component of the value of our business and we rely on the strength of our brand to differentiate ourselves in the marketing and sale of our products. To protect the Naked brand, we have secured trademark registrations in the United States, the European Union and Canada. We also own applications and registrations in the United States, Canada and other jurisdictions for additional Naked-related trademarks. We take steps to enforce and police our Naked trademark and expect to continue to incur expenses for enforcement-related work and for the filing of trademark and other types of intellectual property applications in the U.S. and key international markets in fiscal 2018.
Dwyane Wade Licensing & Endorsement Agreement 
 
In June 2015, we entered into a collaboration and endorsement agreement with NBA champion Dwyane Wade through his commercial entity Wade Enterprises, LLC, which is wholly-owned and controlled by him. Under the agreement with Wade, we will pay Wade royalties in a range of up to ten percent of net wholesale sales of Wade products, subject to certain minimum royalty payments. We also granted Wade and his designee warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 365,688 shares of common stock (the “Wade Grant”) and granted to Wade an additional warrant to purchase up to 36,569 shares of our common stock (the “Protection Warrant”). Both the Wade Grant and Protection Warrant are exercisable for a period of seven years at an exercise price of $4.80 per share. The Wade Grant will vest and become exercisable in three annual installments and will vest in full upon a change of control of our company. The Protection Warrant will become exercisable in the event that, as a result of certain subsequent issuances of our securities, the shares of common stock underlying the Wade Grant represent less than 2% of our fully-diluted equity. The number of shares of common stock for which the Protection Warrant will become exercisable will be equal to the number of shares necessary to ensure that both the Wade Grant and Protection Warrant represent, together, at least 2% of our fully-diluted equity. Further, in the event that we propose to issue any capital stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock, then, subject to certain exceptions, Wade will have the right to purchase such securities on the same terms and conditions in order to maintain his ownership percentage in our company.
Employees
 
We currently employ fourteen full-time employees, of which are thirteen are employed in the United States and one is employed in Canada. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have had no labor-related work stoppages and we believe our relations with our employees are excellent.
Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 17, 2005 under the name of Search By Headlines.com Corp. Immediately prior to the transaction with Naked Inc. described below, we were a public reporting “shell company,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.
 
On July 30, 2012, we completed a reverse acquisition of Naked Inc., whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Naked Inc. in exchange for the issuance of 337,500 shares of common stock in the capital of our company to the Naked Inc. stockholders on a pro-rata basis, representing 50% of the capital stock of our company at the time. As a result of this reverse acquisition transaction, Naked Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company and our business became the manufacture and sale of direct and wholesale men’s innerwear and intimate apparel products in Canada and the United States to consumers and retailers.

Effective August 29, 2012, we changed our name from “Search By Headlines.com Corp.” to “Naked Brand Group Inc.” This change in our corporate name was effectuated by merging a wholly owned subsidiary of our company, which was formed solely to effect the name change, with and into our company.
 
Naked Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, was originally incorporated under the federal laws of Canada on May 21, 2009 as “In Search of Solutions Inc.” Naked changed its corporate name to “Naked Boxer Brief Clothing Inc.” on May 17, 2010 and to “Naked Inc.” on February 20, 2013. Naked Inc. converted from the federal jurisdiction of Canada to the jurisdiction of the State of Nevada on July 27, 2012. As part of the continuation, all classes of shares of Naked, including Class C, D, E and F common shares, were converted into one class of common stock of the continuing corporation.
