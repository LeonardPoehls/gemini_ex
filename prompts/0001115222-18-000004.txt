Item 1.    Business
Overview
The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (“Dun & Bradstreet” or “we” or “us” or “our” or the “Company”) grows the most valuable relationships in business. By uncovering truth and meaning from data, we connect customers with the prospects, suppliers, clients and partners that matter most, and have since 1841. Nearly ninety percent of the Fortune 500, and companies of every size around the world, rely on our data, insights and analytics.
Dun & Bradstreet® is the world’s leading source of commercial data, analytics and insight on businesses. Our global commercial database as of December 31, 2017 contained more than 285 million business records. We transform commercial data into valuable insight which is the foundation of our global solutions that customers rely on to make critical business decisions.
Dun & Bradstreet provides solution sets that meet a diverse set of customer needs globally. Customers use Risk Management Solutions™ to mitigate credit, compliance and supplier risk, increase cash flow and drive increased profitability. Our Sales & Marketing Solutions™ help customers better use data to grow sales, digitally engage with customers and prospects, improve marketing effectiveness and also for data management capabilities that provide effective and cost efficient marketing solutions to increase revenue from new and existing customers.
Our Strategy 
Dun & Bradstreet’s strategy is to become one global company delivering indispensable content through modern channels to serve new customer needs with our forward-leaning culture. We are focused on the commercial marketplace and continuing to be the world’s largest and best provider of insight about businesses.  Our strategy is designed to drive long-term sustainable growth in the years ahead and we remain committed to increasing Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) through revenue growth.
Our strategy has five key components: 

• | First, we continue to globalize the business, moving from a regional structure to an integrated global organization. As part of this transformation we continue to expand upon our relationships with our large, strategic customers, many of which also have global operations, while servicing them as global accounts. We are also continuing to create global, cloud-based solutions, to service our customers. This globalization of our business is being closely integrated with our Worldwide Network® partners. For example, over the past three years, we shifted our businesses based in Latin America, Belgium and the Netherlands (“Benelux”) and Australia and New Zealand (“ANZ”) to a Worldwide Network partner model in support of our global data strategy and customer-centric approach built on having the best data in every market; 


• | Second, we continue to invest in content, which includes our data and analytics, that is indispensable to our customers’ growth. We are constantly improving the quality and consistency of our data around the globe, developing new analytic tools and scores to improve the predictive capability of our content, cultivating new proprietary data sources and acquiring companies and other third-party sources of data to combine with our existing data;


• | Third, we continue to modernize content delivery by transitioning from older, traditional platforms to more agile cloud-based and Data-as-a-Service (“DaaS”) approaches leveraging Application Programming Interface (“API”) connectors, and focus on alliance and third-party distribution in addition to our own products;


• | Fourth, we continue to modernize the brand. Building on our modernized brand efforts, in 2016 we unveiled a reimagined, data-driven, content-led digital experience for our customers, and made significant investments in our persona-based go-to-market strategy; and


• | Fifth, we continue to create an outside-in, forward-leaning culture with a team that is externally focused, and plugged into our customers’ needs and the markets in which we operate.

The strategy is built on the valuable assets the Company possesses today that we believe provide a competitive advantage for Dun & Bradstreet:

• | Well Recognized Brand


• | Superior Content and Solutions


• | Loyal Customers

For the reasons described below, we believe that these core competitive advantages will enable successful execution of our strategy going forward.
Well Recognized Brand 
For over 175 years, Dun & Bradstreet’s well-respected and well-recognized brand has strengthened our position in the marketplace. Our guiding purpose, “Dun & Bradstreet grows the most valuable relationships in business by uncovering truth and meaning from data” underscores our belief that growing strong relationships through data empowers our customers’ success, and we continue to believe that a modern, data-inspired, humanized brand is an important part of our growth strategy.

We continued to build our brand awareness this year.  In 2016, feedback showed that Dun & Bradstreet’s customers associate our brand with a company that is modern, data-inspired and useful.  In 2017, we saw our brand awareness increase among non-customers globally, and by leveraging our data-fueled, content-led websites, our digital experience has won awards for our reimagined digital presence, customizable user experiences and increased engagement.
Superior Content and Solutions
Risk Management Solutions
Risk Management Solutions is our largest customer solution set, accounting for 58%, 59% and 60% of our total revenue, for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. 
Our Risk Management Solutions help customers increase cash flow and profitability while mitigating credit, operational and regulatory risks by helping them answer questions such as:

• | Should I extend credit to this new customer?

• | Will this customer pay me on time?


• | How can I avoid supply chain disruption?


• | How do I know whether I am in compliance with regulatory acts?

• | Supplier Risk Manager, an online application that helps businesses mitigate supply chain risk by certifying and onboarding suppliers and monitoring them for changes in risk. This solution can be paired with our new D&B Spend Intelligence solution, which enables businesses to quickly aggregate and cleanse data from all of their Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) systems and build a single view of their third parties to identify potential expense savings;


• | Our Compliance product suite including D&B Onboard and D&B Compliance Check, which helps customers comply with anti-money laundering and global anti-bribery and corruption regulations through advanced onboarding, screening and monitoring of customers and third parties; and

This includes D&B Direct®, an API that enables data integration inside Enterprise applications such as ERP, and enables master data management and Toolkit.

Certain solutions are available on a subscription pricing basis, including our DNBi and D&B Credit subscription pricing plans. Our subscription pricing plans represent a larger portion of our revenue and provide increased access to our risk management reports and data to help customers increase their profitability while mitigating their risk.
Sales & Marketing Solutions
Sales & Marketing Solutions accounted for 42%, 41% and 40% of our total revenue, for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Our Sales & Marketing Solutions help customers increase revenue from new and existing customers by helping them answer questions such as:

• | Who are my best customers?


• | How can I find prospects that look like my best customers?


• | How can I capture untapped opportunities with my existing customers?


• | How can I measure the health and completeness of my customer, partner, and prospect data sets so I can make faster, more informed decisions?


• | Who are the best contacts at a business for my services?


• | How do I arm my sales force with the right intelligence to engage in a meaningful way and close faster?


• | How can I increase the productivity of my sales teams and eliminate manual efforts?


• | How can I accelerate the buyer’s journey and time to revenue?


• | How do I gain visibility into key markets and target my audiences across online and offline channels?

Our Sales & Marketing Solutions fall into two categories: Sales Acceleration and Advanced Marketing Solutions.

Our principal Sales Acceleration Solutions are:

• | The D&B Hoovers Suite, which uses the world’s largest commercial database from Dun & Bradstreet and sophisticated analytics, to deliver sales acceleration solutions packed with insight. Sales acceleration solutions enable B2B sales and marketing professionals to accelerate sales, enhance go-to-market activity, engage in a meaningful way, and close business faster. The D&B Hoovers Suite is comprised of D&B Hoovers, traditional Hoover’s, and revenues from our joint product with Salesforce.com, Data.com.

• | D&B Audience Targeting, which helps customers serve the right ads to the right audiences, introducing more precision into their online advertising. It enables advertisers and agencies to intelligently target professionals in multiple ways via the insight created by our company and contact data; and

This helps to perform richer web analytics, personalize experiences, mine for leads, prefill web forms, and retarget visitors when they leave the website.

Loyal Customers
We combine the majority of our customer-facing, go-to-market activities into segments called, “Lines of Business,” which creates a more focused approach to serving customers and a strong alignment between product and solutions and how we go to market.
We serve our customers through a multi-channel sales organization, which is centered around two primary areas: our Global Direct sales channel and Global Alliances and Partnerships.
This structure creates alignment with product and solutions, and how they work more closely with our go to market channels. We believe that this more aligned, integrated approach enables us to be more agile and effective in the marketplace and help us to serve our customers efficiently and effectively.
We support principal customers across communications, technology, government, strategic financial services and retail/telecommunications/manufacturing across our sales channels. None of our customers accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue in any of the past three fiscal years.
Segments 
We manage and report our business through two segments:

• | Americas, which consists of our operations in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, and our Latin America Worldwide Network (we divested our Latin America operations in September 2016); and


• | Non-Americas, which consists of our operations in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Greater China, India and our European and Asia Pacific Worldwide Networks (we divested our operations in both the Netherlands and Belgium in November 2016 and both Australia and New Zealand in June 2015).

6

The following table presents the contribution by segment to revenue (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K):

 | For the Years Ended December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Revenue: | | | | | 
Americas | 83 | % | | 83 | % | 81 | %
Non-Americas | 17 | % | | 17 | % | 19 | %

We may also acquire, divest, or shut down businesses from time to time. For example:

• | In January 2017, we acquired Avention, Inc.;


• | In 2016, we completed the sales of our operations in Benelux and Latin America, converting these businesses to our Worldwide Network model; and


• | In 2015, we:


• | Acquired NetProspex, Inc. and Dun & Bradstreet Credibility Corp. (“DBCC”); and


• | Completed the sale of our operations in Australia and New Zealand, converting these businesses to our Worldwide Network model.

Segment data and other information for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As our strategy evolves, we may modify our reporting structure, as appropriate, to reflect changes in the way we manage our business.
We also report and monitor our revenue performance as Risk Management Solutions and Sales & Marketing Solutions. Within Risk Management Solutions, we monitor the performance as Trade Credit and Other Enterprise Risk Management. Trade Credit represents our commercial credit products such as D&B Credit Suite (which includes DNBi® and D&B Credit solutions), and “Other Trade Credit” solutions, which are products and services used to manage credit risk and support our customers’ internal credit risk decisioning process. Other Enterprise Risk Management includes all of our remaining Risk Management products, such as our compliance, supply chain, credit on self and D&B Direct risk solutions. Effective January 1, 2017, we began managing and reporting our Sales and Marketing Solutions as Sales Acceleration and Advanced Marketing Solutions. Sales Acceleration includes solutions designed to align sales and marketing teams around the same refined and inter-connected information (data that is current, tied to buying signals, and delivered with context) to shorten sales cycles, increase win rates, and accelerate revenue growth more quickly. We provide these solutions through applications such as D&B Hoovers, as well as through direct access to our contact data. Advanced Marketing Solutions consists of our Master Data solutions, which enable our customers to integrate and organize data to create a single view of customers and prospects, enrich data, continuously manage data quality and link company identity and hierarchy. It also consists of Audience Solutions products, which use data and analytics to fuel enhanced programmatic targeting and web visitor intelligence.
Our Direct Sales Force 
Our direct sales force consists of approximately 1,700 team members worldwide, of whom approximately 1,300 were in our Americas business and 400 were in our Non-Americas business as of December 31, 2017. Our sales force includes enterprise sales executives and customer solution specialists who sell to our vertically aligned strategic customers and our geographically aligned national commercial customers, a telesales team that sells to our small- and medium-sized customers, and a team that sells to federal, state and local governments.
Our Alliances and the Dun & Bradstreet Worldwide Network
In addition, we have sales teams who are dedicated specifically to our alliance partners. These teams are focused around: (i) alliance partners to whom we are a major supplier of data, which they specifically request and leverage as content to enhance their own products and services for sale to their customers; and (ii) alliance partners who enable the seamless delivery of our data, regardless of the content, to enable their end users to consume our content in a flexible, user friendly manner.
We also conduct business through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, majority-owned joint ventures, independent correspondents, strategic relationships through our Worldwide Network and minority equity investments. Our Worldwide Network is an alliance of network partners covering more than 230 countries. In those countries, we have determined it is 
7

beneficial to engage with dominant, well-known local partners to enable us to better collect data from such countries and to better sell our existing content into such countries. Our Worldwide Network enables our customers globally to make business decisions with confidence, because we incorporate data from the members of the Worldwide Network into our database and utilize it in our customer solutions. Our customers, therefore, have access to a more powerful database and global solution sets that they can rely on to make their business decisions.
Competition
We are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. However, we believe no competitor offers our complete line of solutions, global data breadth and consistency, analytic capabilities and multi-channel approach for commercial entities and the people who run them.
In North America, we are a market leader in our Risk Management Solutions business based upon revenue. We compete with our customers’ own internal business practices by continually developing more efficient alternatives to our customers’ risk management processes to capture more of their internal spend. We also directly compete with a broad range of companies, including consumer credit companies that also have commercial data, such as Equifax, Inc. (“Equifax®”) and Experian Information Solutions, Inc. (“Experian®”), as well as a number of low cost, vertical and regionally specific companies. In addition, competitors with unique assets and capabilities outside of commercial data create bundled offerings that are attractive to certain customer segments.
We also compete in North America with a broad range of companies offering solutions similar to our Sales & Marketing Solutions. Our direct competitors in Sales & Marketing Solutions vary significantly depending on the many possible uses for our solutions such as market segmentation, digital marketing lead generation, lead enrichment, sales effectiveness, and data management. We also face competition in data services from our customers’ own internal development and from data quality software solutions.
Outside the U.S., the competitive environment varies by region and country, and can be significantly impacted by the legislative actions of local governments, availability of data and local business preferences.
In the U.K. and Ireland, our direct competition is primarily from Experian and Moody’s /Bureau van Dijk®. We believe that we offer superior solutions when compared to these competitors. In addition, the Sales & Marketing Solutions landscape in these markets is both localized and fragmented, where numerous local players of varying size compete for business.
In Asia Pacific, we face competition in our Risk Management Solutions business from a mix of local and global providers. For example, we compete with Experian in India and with Sinotrust International Information & Consulting (Beijing) Co., Ltd. in China. In addition, as in the U.K., the Sales & Marketing Solutions landscape throughout Asia is localized and fragmented.
We also face significant competition from the in-house operations of the businesses we seek as customers, other general and specialized credit reporting and business information services, and credit insurers. In addition, business information solutions and services are becoming more readily available, principally due to greater availability of public data, greater use of modern analytical techniques such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, and the emergence of new providers of business information solutions and services.
We believe that our trusted brand, proprietary data assets, global identity resolution knowledge, globally recognized D-U-N-S® Number and analytic capabilities form a powerful competitive advantage.
Our ability to continue to compete effectively will be based on a number of factors, including our ability to:

• | Communicate and demonstrate to our customers the value of our existing and new products and services based upon our proprietary data, and as a result, improve customer satisfaction;


• | Maintain and develop our proprietary D-U-N-S® numbering classification system and information and services such as analytics;


• | Develop new content from both public and proprietary data sources;


• | Leverage our technology to significantly improve our value proposition for customers in order to make Dun & Bradstreet’s data available wherever and whenever our customers need it, as well as our brand perception and the value of our Worldwide Network;

8


• | Maintain those third-party relationships on whom we rely for data and certain operational services; and


• | Attract and retain a high-performing workforce.

Intellectual Property 
We own and control various intellectual property rights, such as trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, patents and applications to the foregoing. These rights, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. We also believe that the Dun & Bradstreet name and related trade names, marks and logos are of material importance to our business. We are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others, and other companies are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us. We consider our trademarks, service marks, databases, software, copyrights, patents, patent applications and other intellectual property to be proprietary, and we rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret, patent, etc.) and contract and liability safeguards for protecting them throughout the world.
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the names of our branded solutions and services referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are common law or registered trademarks or service marks owned by or licensed to us or one or more of our subsidiaries.
We own patents and patent applications both in the U.S. and in other selected countries of importance to us. The patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to certain technologies and inventions which we have determined are proprietary and warrant patent protection. We believe that the protection of our innovative technology and inventions, such as our proprietary methods for data curation and identity resolution, through the filing of patent applications, is a prudent business strategy, and we will continue to seek to protect those certain assets for which we have expended substantial capital or otherwise deem to provide a competitive advantage. Filing of these patent applications may or may not provide us with a dominant position in the fields of technology. However, these patents and/or patent applications may provide us with legal defenses should subsequent patents in these fields be issued to third-parties and later asserted against us. Where appropriate, we may also consider asserting or cross-licensing our patents.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 4,900 employees worldwide, of whom approximately 3,500 were in our Americas segment and Corporate, and approximately 1,400 were in our Non-Americas segment. Our workforce also engages third-party consultants as an ongoing part of our business where appropriate. There are no unions in our U.S. or Canada operations, and works councils and trade unions represent a small portion of our employees outside of the U.S. and Canada. 
We know we must have a passionate, forward-leaning culture to support our growth strategy and brand.  Toward that end, we are implementing our long-term plan to attract and retain top talent, deliver modern learning and development programs and deeply foster an environment of diversity and inclusion. 
In 2017, we launched a number of key people initiatives including, but not limited to:

• | Our Executive Talent Acquisition Program, including a global modern onboarding process and real-time learning and development efforts (inclusive of a global mentoring program), in order to better attract, accelerate and retain top talent.


• | Our Diversity and Inclusion efforts where we live our Corporate Diversity Statement, build inclusion and community through a centralized site of content, site-specific global initiatives and learning and development opportunities to represent and foster the world’s mosaic in our workforce.


• | We continue to transform our culture through creative initiatives, modern systems and leading practices, including maximizing our People Technology solution to accelerate people analytics, continued Ampersand Awards recognition to team members who embody our values, and continuous Sustainable High Performance efforts throughout the year.
