Target Market
 
We plan to target mid-size to large companies as app development is suitable for all types of companies that want to modernize their operations. In addition, we plan to target mid-size companies for our website design services.
Marketing and Sales
 
Currently, our officer and director handles all marketing and sales efforts. Within the next 12 months, we hope to have generated enough revenue to develop a marketing campaign to promote and publicize our website and services.
 
We do not have any specific marketing channels in place at this point to be able to market our services to potential customers. However, in the next twelve months, we hope to attend conferences, advertise by word of mouth and possible reach out to local businesses to sell our services. We do expect that the biggest part of our marketing and sales strategy will be from word of mouth advertising. Referrals from people that were pleased with our level of service will be our most efficient form of marketing.
 
Competition
 
The app development and website design industry is highly competitive because the barrier to entry is very low. Additionally, the market is very fragmented with many small companies competing against each other. We expect to be able to compete by providing responsive and knowledgeable consultants at reasonable prices.
Services Pricing
 
We anticipate that our fees would start at $5,000 for easier, simpler applications and get more expensive as detail and complexity increase. To date, we have entered into agreements with six (6) clients and have charged them each flat fees ranging from $7,500 to $90,000.
Employees
 
We presently have no employees apart from our officer and director. Our officer and director devotes about 20 hours per week to our affairs.
