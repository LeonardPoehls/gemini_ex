 Item 1. Business.
 OVERVIEW AND NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 General
 Kate Spade & Company operates principally under two global, multichannel lifestyle brands: kate spade new york and JACK SPADE. The Company’s four category pillars — women’s, men’s, children’s and home — span demographics, genders and geographies. In addition, we own the Adelington Design Group, a private brand jewelry design and development group. Recent Initiatives and Business Strategy
 In the first quarter of 2017, the Board of Directors, together with management, began conducting a process to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives to further enhance shareholder value. We have retained a financial advisor and legal counsel to assist us with our exploration of strategic alternatives. The Board of Directors plans to proceed in a timely manner, but has not set a definitive timetable for completion of this process. There can be no assurance that this review process will result in a transaction or other strategic alternative of any kind, or if a transaction is undertaken, as to its terms or timing. As previously disclosed, we do not intend to disclose developments or provide updates on the progress or status of this process until the Board of Directors deems further disclosure is appropriate or required.
     In the first quarter of 2017, we entered into an agreement to open a kate spade new york flagship store in Paris, France, which is expected to open during the second quarter of 2017.
     In September 2016, we entered into a global licensing agreement with Perfume Center of America, Inc. (“PCA”) for the design, development and distribution of kate spade new york fragrance products through 2023. Accordingly, we now earn royalty income under this arrangement and no longer sell fragrance products through our wholesale channel.   
     We are focusing on initiatives that drive margin improvement and continue to grow the kate spade new york brand through product category and geographic expansion across our four category pillars: women’s, men’s, children’s and home. We have established the following operating and financial goals around that framework to further develop kate spade new york into a global lifestyle brand:

· | driving top line growth by: (i) focusing on our handbag business and elevating our brand voice while incorporating relevant trends and technology; (ii) expanding product categories within our existing network, including footwear, tech, menswear and athleisure; and (iii) expanding our presence in selected geographies through global customer relationships and market-based strategies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | driving quality of sale initiatives with continued moderation of promotions across channels and expanded assortments to balance access and aspiration;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | delivering the world of kate spade new york to our customer seamlessly across channels through a channel‑agnostic approach, while leveraging our e‑commerce site as a global flagship, offering our broadest product assortment across our category pillars and improving delivery speed to our consumer by continuing to enhance our buy anywhere, receive anywhere model;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increased marketing that leverages customer relationship management (“CRM”) capability and focuses on real-time, personalized customer insight; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | enhancing customer experience and engagement through digital and data capabilities, as well as broadening our four pillar assortment in our stores to drive omni-channel sales.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Macroeconomic challenges and uncertainty continue to persist in the primary markets in which we operate. Therefore, we continue to focus on the careful execution of our strategic plans and seek opportunities to improve our productivity and

profitability. We remain focused on driving operating cash flow generation, managing liquidity and the efficient use of working capital.
 Business Segments
 We operate our kate spade new york and JACK SPADE brands through one operating segment in North America and three operating segments internationally: Japan, Asia (excluding Japan) and Europe. Our Adelington Design Group reportable segment is also an operating segment. The three reportable segments described below represent activities for which separate financial information is available and which is utilized on a regular basis by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and allocate resources. In identifying our reportable segments, we considered our management structure and the economic characteristics, products, customers, sales growth potential and long‑term profitability of our operating segments. As such, we configured our operations into the following three reportable segments:
· | KATE SPADE North America segment — consists of our kate spade new york and JACK SPADE brands in North America.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | KATE SPADE International segment — consists of our kate spade new york and JACK SPADE brands in International markets (principally in Japan, Asia (excluding Japan), Europe and Latin America).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Adelington Design Group segment — primarily consists of exclusive arrangements to supply jewelry for the LIZ CLAIBORNE and MONET brands.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We, as licensor, also license to third parties the right to produce and market products bearing certain Company‑owned trademarks.

 ADELINGTON DESIGN GROUP
 The operations within our Adelington Design Group segment primarily consist of exclusive supplier arrangements to provide J.C. Penney Corporation, Inc. (“JCPenney”) with LIZ CLAIBORNE and MONET branded jewelry.     SALES AND MARKETING
 Domestic direct‑to‑consumer sales are made through our own specialty retail and outlet stores and e‑commerce websites. Our domestic wholesale sales are made primarily to department store chains and specialty retail store customers. Wholesale sales are also made to international customers, military exchanges and to other channels of distribution.
 In Japan, we distribute our products mainly through department store concessions, retail stores and e‑commerce. In Asia (excluding Japan), we have wholesale distribution agreements in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, India and Thailand and joint ventures in China and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. In Europe, direct‑to‑consumer sales are made through our own specialty retail and outlet stores, concession stores within department store locations and e‑commerce. In Canada, direct‑to‑consumer sales are made through our own specialty retail, outlet stores and e‑commerce. In other international markets, including the Middle East, Australia and Latin America, we operate principally through third party distributors, virtually all of which purchase products from us for re‑sale at freestanding retail stores and dedicated department store shops they operate.
 We continually monitor retail sales in order to directly assess consumer response to our products. During 2016, we continued our domestic in‑store sales, marketing and merchandising programs designed to encourage multiple item regular price sales, build one‑on‑one relationships with consumers and maintain our merchandise presentation standards. These programs train sales associates on suggested selling techniques, product, merchandise presentation and client development strategies. Our kate spade new york retail stores reflect the distinct personality of the brand and accent our customers’ interesting lives, offering a unique shopping experience and exclusive merchandise. We plan to use more targeted communication to customers and evolve the customer shopping experience via our continued improvement to our CRM capabilities and a focus on real-time, personalized customer insight and through the use of our kate spade new york e‑commerce site as a global flagship containing all merchandise collections.

 We operate specialty retail stores under the kate spade new york trademark, consisting of retail stores within the US and outside the US (primarily in Japan, Europe and Canada).

----+------------------------------------------------------------------

  We continue to evolve our direct‑to‑consumer marketing and distribution activities by enhancing our omni‑channel capabilities. Our goal is to create a seamless consumer buying experience across direct‑to‑consumer sub‑channels by allowing fulfillment of e‑commerce orders from substantially all retail stores and fulfillment of retail store sales with e‑commerce inventory when the merchandise is not initially available in the respective sub‑channel. Consumers also have the ability to place e‑commerce orders through point of sale mobile devices located within our retail stores. During 2016, we also continued our partnership with Radial and mobile‑enabled webstores using the DemandWare platform. During 2016, we also launched a store locator, as well as online personal shopping appointments to help drive additional e-commerce traffic into stores. 
 Wholesale:
 No single customer accounted for more than 10.0% of net sales for 2016, 2015 and 2014. Sales to our domestic and international department and specialty retail store customers are made primarily through our New York City and London showrooms.
 Orders from our wholesale customers generally precede the related shipping periods by several months. Our largest customers discuss with us retail trends and their plans regarding their anticipated levels of total purchases of our products for future seasons. These discussions are intended to assist us in planning the production and timely delivery of our products.
 We utilize in‑stock reorder programs to enable customers to reorder certain items through electronic means for quick delivery, as discussed below in the section entitled “Buying/Sourcing.” Many of our wholesale customers participate in our in‑stock reorder programs through their own internal replenishment systems.
 Licensing:
 We license our trademarks to third parties with expertise in certain specialized products and/or market segments, thereby extending each licensed brand’s market presence. As of December 31, 2016, we had 24 license arrangements, pursuant to which third party licensees produce merchandise using Company‑owned trademarks in accordance with designs furnished 

 
  9

 
or approved by us, the present terms of which (not including renewal terms) expire at various dates through 2025. Our licenses cover a broad range of lifestyle product categories, including but not limited to, tech accessories, footwear, stationery and paper goods, legwear, fashion accessories, housewares, activewear, optics and sunglasses, watches, fragrance, tabletop products, table linens, children’s wear, swimwear, cold weather accessories, loungewear and sleepwear, indoor and outdoor fabrics and wall coverings, furniture, rugs, lighting and bedding. Such licenses earn revenue based on a percentage of the licensee’s sales of the licensed products against a guaranteed minimum royalty, which generally increases over the term of the agreement. Income from our licensing operations is included in net sales for the segment under which the license resides.
 In November 2011, we sold the global trademark rights for the LIZ CLAIBORNE family of brands and the trademark rights in the US and Puerto Rico for the MONET brand to JCPenney. The LIZWEAR trademark is licensed back to us on a royalty‑free basis through July 2020.
 Marketing:
 Marketing for our brands is focused on reinforcing brand relevance, increasing awareness, engaging consumers and guiding them to our retail stores and e‑commerce sites. We use a variety of marketing strategies to enhance our brand equity and promote our brands. These initiatives include internet marketing, including the use of social media, direct mail and in‑store events. We incurred expenses of $56.5 million, $56.0 million and $56.9 million for advertising, marketing and promotion for all brands in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 In 2016, we continued our in‑store shop and fixture programs, which are designed to enhance the presentation of our products on department store selling floors and internationally through duty free shops and cruise ships generally through the use of proprietary fixturing, merchandise presentations and graphics. In‑store shops operate under the kate spade new york and JACK SPADE brand names. In 2016, we installed an aggregate of 43 domestic and international in‑store shops.
 For further information concerning our domestic and international sales, see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 BUYING/SOURCING
 Pursuant to a buying/sourcing agency agreement, Li & Fung acts as a global buying/sourcing agent. On March 24, 2015, we modified this arrangement in order to, among other things, transition our buying/sourcing activities for our accessories products to an in‑house model, beginning with our Spring 2016 collection. The modification included a reduction of the annual minimum value of inventory purchases and a change in the commission rates for certain products. We pay Li & Fung an agency commission based on the cost of our product purchases through Li & Fung. We are obligated to use Li & Fung as our primary buying/sourcing agent for our ready‑to‑wear apparel products and we may use Li & Fung as a buying/sourcing agent with respect to our accessories products, with all such product purchases applying toward a minimum volume commitment of inventory purchases each year through the expiration of the term of the agreement on March 31, 2018. Our agreement with Li & Fung is not exclusive.
 Products produced in Asia represent a substantial majority of our purchases. We also source product in the US and other regions. During 2016, approximately 66 suppliers located in 10 countries manufactured our products, with the largest finished goods supplier accounting for approximately 15.5% of the total of finished goods we purchased. Purchases from our suppliers are processed utilizing individual purchase orders specifying the price and quantity of the items to be produced.
 Most of our products are purchased as completed product “packages” from our manufacturing contractors, where the contractor purchases all necessary raw materials and other product components, according to our specifications. When we do not purchase “packages”, we obtain fabrics, trimmings and other raw materials in bulk from various foreign and domestic suppliers, which are delivered to our manufacturing contractors for use in our products. We do not have any long‑term, formal arrangements with any supplier of raw materials. To date, we have experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements and consider our sources of supply adequate.

 
  10

 

 We operate under substantial time constraints in producing each of our collections, especially in light of our current “speed to market” initiative. In order to deliver, in a timely manner, merchandise that reflects our consumers’ current tastes, we attempt to schedule a substantial portion of our materials and manufacturing commitments relatively late in the production cycle, thereby favoring suppliers able to make quick adjustments in response to changing production needs and in time to take advantage of favorable (cost effective) shipping alternatives. However, in order to secure necessary materials and to schedule production time at manufacturing facilities, we must make substantial advance commitments prior to the receipt of firm orders from customers for the items to be produced. These advance commitments may have lead times in excess of five months. We continue to seek to reduce the time required to move products from design to the customer.
 If we misjudge our ability to sell our products, we could be faced with substantial outstanding fabric and/or manufacturing commitments, resulting in excess inventories. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors.”
 Our buying/sourcing arrangements with Li & Fung and with our foreign suppliers are subject to the risks of doing business abroad, including currency fluctuations and revaluations, restrictions on the transfer of funds, terrorist activities, pandemic disease and, in certain parts of the world, political, economic and currency instability. Our buying/sourcing arrangements with Li & Fung and with our foreign suppliers have not been materially affected by any such factors to date. However, due to the very substantial portion of our products that are produced abroad, any substantial disruption of our relationships with our foreign suppliers could adversely affect our operations. In addition, as Li & Fung is the buying/sourcing agent for a significant portion of our apparel products, we are subject to the risk of having to rebuild such buying/sourcing capacity or find another agent or agents to replace Li & Fung in the event the agreement with Li & Fung terminates, or if Li & Fung is unable to fulfill its obligations under the agreement.
 In addition, as we rely on independent manufacturers, a manufacturer’s failure to ship product to us in a timely manner, or to meet quality or safety standards, could cause us to miss delivery dates to our retail stores or our wholesale customers. Failure to make deliveries on time could cause our retail customers to expect more promotions and our wholesale customers to seek reduced prices, cancel orders or refuse deliveries, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. We maintain internal staff responsible for overseeing product safety compliance, irrespective of our agency agreement with Li & Fung.
 Additionally, we are a certified and validated member of the United States Customs and Border Protection’s Customs‑Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“C‑TPAT”) program and expect all of our suppliers shipping to the United States to adhere to our C‑TPAT requirements, including standards relating to facility security, procedural security, personnel security, cargo security and the overall protection of the supply chain. In the event a supplier does not comply with our C‑TPAT requirements, or if we determine that the supplier will be unable to correct a deficiency, we may terminate our business relationship with the supplier.
 IMPORTS AND IMPORT RESTRICTIONS
 Virtually all of our merchandise imported into the United States, Asia, Canada and Europe is subject to duties. The United States may unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported (from China or other countries) in such increased quantities as to cause (or threaten) serious damage to the relevant domestic industry (generally known as “anti‑dumping” actions). Furthermore, additional duties, generally known as countervailing duties, can also be imposed by the US Government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a US industry. Legislative proposals have been put forward which, if adopted, would treat a manipulation by China of the value of its currency as actionable under the anti‑dumping or countervailing duty laws.
 In addition, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 authorizes the US Trade Representative to take a host of retaliatory actions (including, among others, the suspension of concessions under trade agreements, and the imposition of duties or other import restrictions) when it determines that the rights of the US under any trade agreement are being denied; or an act, policy, or practice of a foreign country violates any trade agreement, or is unjustifiable and burdens US commerce.
 We are also subject to other international trade agreements and regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”), the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the Caribbean Basin Initiative and other “special 

 
  11

 
trade programs.” Each of the countries in which our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports. Because the US and the other countries into which our products are imported and sold may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges or other import controls or restrictions, including the imposition of “safeguard provisions,” “safeguard duties,” or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels on products being imported from other countries, we monitor import restrictions and opportunities. The sourcing of imported merchandise is also potentially subject to political developments in the countries of production. We strive to reduce our potential exposure to import related risks through, among other things, adjustments in product design and fabrication and shifts of production among countries and manufacturers.
 In light of the fact that a substantial portion of our products is manufactured by foreign suppliers, the enactment of new legislation or the administration of current international trade regulations, executive action affecting trade agreements, or changes in buying/sourcing patterns or quota provisions, could adversely affect our operations. The implementation of any “safeguard provisions,” “countervailing duties,” any “anti‑dumping” actions or any other actions impacting international trade could result in cost increases for certain categories of products and in disruption of the supply chain for certain product categories. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors.”
 The incoming US administration has threatened to impose retaliatory duties against China in order to reverse what it perceives as unfair trade practices which have negatively impacted US manufacturing efforts. The incoming administration has also discussed the implementation of a “border adjusted tax,” which would impose an additional tax on imported goods (regardless of origin). The incoming administration has also discussed the potential renegotiation of the NAFTA, which could affect our ability to effectively source merchandise in the Northern Hemisphere. 
 Apparel and other products sold by us are also subject to regulation in the US and other countries by other governmental agencies, including, in the US, the Federal Trade Commission, the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, content and safety requirements, licensing requirements and flammability testing. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with those regulations, as well as applicable federal, state, local, and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment. We do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current year or in the near future. Our licensed products, licensing partners and buying/sourcing agents are also subject to regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners and buying/sourcing agents to operate in compliance with all laws and regulations and we are not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.
 Although we have not suffered any material inhibition from doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce trademarks to new markets.
 DISTRIBUTION
 We distribute our products through leased facilities. On February 5, 2013, we entered into a contract with a third party facility operations and labor management company to provide distribution operations services at our West Chester, OH distribution center (the “Ohio Facility”) under a variable cost structure. In July 2013, we completed a sale‑leaseback agreement for the Ohio Facility. We received net proceeds of $20.3 million, and we entered into a sale‑leaseback arrangement with the buyer for a 10‑year term. BACKLOG
 On February 3, 2017, our order book reflected unfilled customer orders for approximately $98.6 million of merchandise, as compared to approximately $111.5 million at February 5, 2016. These orders represent our order backlog. The amounts indicated include both confirmed and unconfirmed orders, which we believe, based on industry practice and our past experience, will be confirmed. We expect that substantially all such orders will be filled within the 2017 fiscal year. We note that the amount of order backlog at any given date is materially affected by a number of factors, including, among others, seasonality, the mix of product, the timing of the receipt and processing of customer orders and scheduling of the 

 
  12

 
manufacture and shipping of the product, which in some instances is dependent on the desires of the customer. Accordingly, order book data should not be taken as providing meaningful period‑to‑period comparisons.
 TRADEMARKS
 The following table summarizes the principal trademarks we own and/or use in connection with our businesses and products:
 Company Owned Trademarks

kate spade new york | TRIFARI 

  Third Party Owned Trademarks

----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | Licensed to the Company by JCPenney on a royalty‑free basis.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | Domestic rights only.
----+----------------------

  In addition, we own and/or use many other logos and trademarks associated with the above mentioned trademarks. We have registered, or applied for registration of, a multitude of trademarks throughout the world, including those referenced above, for use on a variety of apparel and other products, including fashion accessories, home furnishings, fragrance and cosmetics, jewelry, watches, hosiery, optics and sunglasses, tech accessories, stationery and paper goods, tabletop products, table linen products, children’s wear, swimwear, cold weather accessories, loungewear and sleepwear, indoor and outdoor fabrics and wall coverings and bedding, as well as for retail services. We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that they have significant value in the marketing of our products. We vigorously protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights against infringement on a worldwide basis.
 In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks are used in connection with the related products and services and the required registration renewals are filed. We regard the license to use the trademarks and our other proprietary rights in and to the trademarks as valuable assets in marketing our products. As a result of the appeal of our brands, our products have from time to time been the object of counterfeiting. We have an established and aggressive enforcement program, which we believe has been generally effective in controlling the sale of counterfeit products in the US and in major markets abroad.
 In markets outside of the US, our rights to some or all of our trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks, which would impede our use and registration of some of our principal trademarks. While such conflicts are common and may arise again from time to time as we continue our international expansion, we have generally successfully resolved such conflicts in the past through both legal action and negotiated settlements with third party owners of the conflicting marks. Although we have not in the past suffered any material restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable markets or in new product categories, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce new and additional brands, both in the US and in other markets.

 COMPETITION
 We are subject to intense competition as the accessories and apparel related product markets are highly competitive, both within the US and abroad. We compete with numerous retailers, designers and manufacturers of accessories and apparel, both domestic and foreign. We compete primarily on the basis of fashion, quality, customer service, price, brand prestige and recognition. Our ability to compete successfully depends upon a variety of factors, including, among other things, our ability to:
· | anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands in a timely manner;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | develop quality and differentiated products that appeal to consumers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | appropriately price products;
--+------------------------------


· | establish and maintain favorable brand name and recognition;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | maintain and grow market share;
--+--------------------------------


· | establish and maintain acceptable relationships with our retail customers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | appropriately determine the size and identify the location of our retail stores and department store selling space;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | provide appropriate service and support to retailers;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | provide effective marketing support and brand promotion;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | protect our intellectual property; and
--+---------------------------------------


· | optimize our retail and supply chain capabilities.
--+---------------------------------------------------

  See “Item 1A — Risk Factors.”
 Our principal competitors for kate spade new york include Burberry, Coach, Marc by Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, Ralph Lauren and Tory Burch.
 EMPLOYEES
 On December 31, 2016, we had approximately 3,900 full‑time employees worldwide, as compared to approximately 3,600 full‑time employees on January 2, 2016.
 Our relations with our employees are satisfactory and to date we have not experienced any interruption of our operations due to employee issues.
 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
 We are committed to responsible corporate citizenship and giving back to our communities through a variety of avenues. We have several programs in place that support this commitment.  Monitoring Global Working Conditions
 We are committed to taking the actions we believe are necessary to ensure that our products are made in contracted factories with fair and decent working conditions. In addition to auditing all of our direct suppliers, we continue this commitment as we operate under our buying/sourcing arrangement with Li & Fung, collaborating with Li & Fung to develop mutually acceptable audit standards, training the Li & Fung audit staff on our compliance program and communicating our standards to our suppliers and their workers.
 The major components of our compliance program are: (i) communicating our Standards of Engagement to workers, suppliers and associates; (ii) auditing and monitoring against those standards; (iii) providing workers with a confidential 

 
  14

 
reporting channel; (iv) working with non‑governmental organizations regarding issues impacting workers; and (v) working closely with factory management to develop sustainable compliance programs. Suppliers are required to post our Standards of Engagement in the workers’ native language at all factories where our merchandise is being manufactured. The Standards of Engagement, along with detailed explanations of each standard, are included in our supplier manual. All new suppliers must acknowledge our standards and agree to our monitoring requirements.
 We audit factories using both internal and independent monitors and look for ways to develop direct communication channels with workers to ensure that they are aware of their rights. More information about our monitoring program is available on our website.
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 69 active factories on our roster, of which 66 were audited by Li & Fung auditors, third party auditors and our internal compliance team. Additionally, there were 63 follow‑up audits. In many cases, we rely on our agents’ audit reports. As such, we continue to conduct shadow audits to confirm that audit protocols and findings are consistent.
 We also contractually obligate all of our licensees to comply with and to assure that all of their affiliates, subcontractors and suppliers comply with our Standards of Engagement as well as all applicable laws. Our license agreements generally also provide that we have the right to inspect all facilities used by our licensees and their subcontractors, suppliers, agents and representatives to assure compliance with our standards.
 We are aware that auditing only confirms compliance at the time of the audit, and we continue to look for ways to improve our monitoring program and work with suppliers to create sustainable compliance at their factories. Creating workers’ awareness and establishing a channel of communication for reporting issues of non‑compliance are two important strategies. We encourage all factories to establish internal grievance procedures and give workers the opportunity to report their concerns directly to the Company. This year we have provided supplier training covering best practices, social compliance requirements and review of our standards and policies. 
 Philanthropic Programs
 We have a number of philanthropic programs that support the nonprofit sector in our major operating communities.

· | The Kate Spade & Company Foundation (the “Foundation”), established as the Liz Claiborne Foundation in 1981, is a separate nonprofit legal entity supporting nonprofit organizations working with women transforming communities. The Foundation supports programs in and around the New York City metropolitan area, where our primary offices are located, that offer training and increase access to tools that help women become economically empowered. The mission of the Foundation remains focused on women’s economic empowerment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | For more than ten years, we have been committed to creating opportunities for our associates to volunteer and give back to nonprofit organizations in our major operating communities. In 2016, we continued to support our associate volunteering program to create opportunities that reflected our charitable strategies.

 Environmental Initiatives
 We are committed to a long‑term sustainable approach to caring for and safeguarding the environment. As such, we endeavor to balance environmental considerations and social responsibility with our business goals by evolving and implementing our corporate environmental policy, in addition to complying with environmental laws and regulations. Our current sustainability policy focuses on three major components — reducing waste, reusing and recycling — to help minimize our impact on the environment.
