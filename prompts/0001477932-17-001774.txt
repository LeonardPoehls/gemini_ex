Overview
 
Debt Resolve, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed in April 1997. Our traditional business has been providing software solutions to consumer lenders or those collecting on consumer loans using a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. These solutions facilitate web-based payments or the resolution of delinquent or defaulted consumer debt. We have marketed our services primarily to consumer banks, collection agencies, and the buyers of defaulted debt in the United States. Other opportunities exist for marketing our software to hospitals and large physician groups. In addition, client results show that our solution is attractive for the collection of low balance debt, such as that held by utility companies and online service providers, where the cost of traditionally labor intensive collection efforts may exceed the value collected. We are pursuing these markets as well as our traditional markets. 
 
In December 2014, the Company, jointly with LSH, LLC, organized Progress Advocates LLC, a Delaware limited liability company for the purpose to provide services in the Federal Student Loan document preparation industry with ownership interests of 51% and 49% for the Company and LSH, LLC, respectively. This joint venture was operated under service agreements with LSH companies. In February, 2016, sales and marketing operations were suspended due to unmanaged marketing costs and customer retention issues that resulted in current and forecasted future net losses. This joint venture provided 12 months of operating experience in this growing industry as well as positive feedback as the first company in our joint venture strategy, described below. 
 
In February 2016, the Company, jointly with Patient Online Services, LLC, organized Payment Resolution Systems LLC, a Delaware limited liability company for the purpose of assisting Medical Groups and Hospitals in the online negotiation and settlement of delinquent accounts, with ownership interests of 51% and 49% for the Company and Patient Online Services, LLC, respectively. 
 
In May 2016, the Company, jointly with Hutton Ventures LLC, organized Student Loan Care LLC, a Delaware limited liability company for the purpose of providing document preparation services for holders of Federal Direct Student Loans, with ownership interests of 51% and 49% for the Company and Hutton Ventures LLC, respectively. The business model for this joint venture addresses the issues noted above that caused the suspension of sales at Progress Advocates LLC.

The Company operates Payment Resolution Systems within Debt Resolve, Inc., whereas Progress Advocates LLC and Student Loan Care LLC operate as independent subsidiaries. 
 
Business Growth Strategy Update
 
During the year ending December 31, 2016, significant progress was made in the implementation of our new strategies. While individual setbacks were expected and did occur, each was addressed and positive momentum resumed for the respective strategy. The following is a brief review of the important progress achieved in each strategy:

· | Student Loan Care LLC was launched in June 2016 and established itself as a financially viable company in the year ending December 31, 2016. This new joint venture is a partnership with Hutton Ventures LLC., a California based company with extensive experience in the federal student loan document preparation industry. The business model for Student Loan Care, specifically addresses the issues of high marketing costs and customer churn, both of which were significant negative impacts on the Company’s majority owned joint venture, Progress Advocates LLC. From its first month of operation in June 2016, Revenue grew every month from $104,818 in June, to $1,927,702 in the quarter ending December 31, 2016. Over the same period, operating income turned positive and grew every month from ($170,305) June to $464,906 in the quarter ending December 31, 2016. Gross margins were positive for the last six months, growing sequentially to 26% of sales. These margins were over 10% higher than the best monthly margin achieved by Progress Advocates in 2015. These margin improvements are a direct result of Student Loan Care’s new marketing model that reduced the cost of customer acquisition by 40% as compared to the customer acquisition cost at Progress Advocates. To enhance the sales efforts, in November 2016, Student Loan Care contracted with a non-related party to act as a sales affiliate. In this role, the affiliate will provide an external sales team to function as Student Loan Care salespeople. Each will be remotely integrated into the Student Loan Care sales infrastructure and will generate Student Loan Care sales for which the affiliate will be paid a sales commission. Early tests during the fourth quarter indicate this sales model can generate sales with only a modest 10% increase in customer acquisition cost. As the affiliate’s sales team becomes more familiar with the Student Loan Care sales process, it is anticipated that sales productivity will be the same as Student Loan Care’s internal sales team.

· | Progress Advocates continues to support its current customers as it evaluates other business options. As previously reported in both the Company's 2015 Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2016, the Company suspended all marketing and sales activities during February of 2016. After continued discussions with our joint venture partner who was also the operator of Progress Advocates, the Company reached the conclusion that the changes necessary to reach profitability were not going to be made by our partner. By the beginning of 2016, it was evident that high marketing and sales costs, along with a higher than expected default of customer payments, resulted in a business cost structure that was unsupportable by current revenues. Progress Advocates will continue to support its current customers and provide to them all contracted services. In September, Progress Advocates initiated discussions to explore the sale of its loan portfolio. Initial response has been positive. However, no offers have been made to indicate the relative market value of this asset. 
· | Enhance the Debt Resolve Solution by integrating it with other services to become a total solution for the medical ARM market. Our majority owned joint venture, Payment Resolution Systems offers a service to Medical Practices and Hospitals looking to give patients with unpaid accounts one last chance to pay. The one last chance will be a negotiated settlement offering using Debt Resolve's patented double blind bidding technology. A pilot of this business was run in March and April of 2016 with a NYC Anesthesiology practice. The results were better than expected and a second pilot was run for an Atlanta GA Anesthesiology Group. This effort confirmed our initial results and demonstrated our ability to negotiate settlements for high and low account balances. A national sales effort has been initiated with significant interest by healthcare providers, however, the sales cycle has been longer than anticipated due to push back from the prospective client’s current ARM vendors.

· | Leverage our technology and knowledge of consumer debt collection to launch a new internet based product in the small business to consumer debt negotiation and collection space. As resources were diverted to support the launch and development of Student loan Care LLC (see above), the development effort on Settl.it/Pro was postponed to the first quarter of 2017. A soft launch of this small business product is scheduled for April 2017. Pending market response, national availability is anticipated in May 2017.

· | Leverage our public equity financial structure by purchasing equity interests in private companies that will benefit from the experience and skills of our management and consultants as well as from holding our publicly traded equity. During the second quarter of 2016, , Student Loan Care LLC was formed with Hutton Ventures LLC to offer document preparation services for Federal student loan holders wanting to apply for various U.S. Department of Education Student loan payment consolidation and modification programs. The principles of Hutton Ventures are experienced in the federal student loan document preparation industry and in the use of advanced communications techniques to increase productivity and profitability in a traditional people based business environment. To reward their successful participation in Student Loan Care LLC, goals for Student Loan Care revenue growth and net profit attainment have been established. Hutton Venture partners will be granted warrants for Debt Resolve common stock upon the attainment of each of these goals.

Corporate and Background Information
 
We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation in April 1997 under our former name, Lombardia Acquisition Corp. On May 7, 2003, our certificate of incorporation was amended to change our corporate name to Debt Resolve, Inc.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 1133 Westchester Ave., Suite S-223, White Plains, New York 10604, and our telephone number is (914) 949-5500. As of December 31, 2016, we had a core Debt Resolve software business and two operating subsidiaries, Progress Advocates LLC and Student Loan Care LLC. Our website is located at http://www.debtresolve.com. Information contained in our website is not part of this report.
 
Our Strengths
 
While our products often offer unique and exclusive features that are beneficial to our customers, our strength is understanding the markets that we serve. In the Federal Student Loan document preparation space, we saw a need to overcome the perceived complexity of the DOE programs, educate the consumer on the important features of each program, and eliminate the high upfront cost associated with the use of a third party preparer. Our financing option allows prospective customers to benefit from our services at a low monthly cost. An additional result of the financing option is the positive impact that making payments has on the credit score of these low credit score customers. We also saw the need to match our receipt of payment to when the work is done for the customer. Our initial billing is designed to coincide with the customer’s successful consolidation notification. In addition, our customer care representatives are available to provide guidance and assistance to keep the clients successfully in these valuable federal programs. 
 
In the traditional Debt Resolve service space, the advantage is not having just a standalone debt collection product, but in having an integrated solution where the consumer decides which channel to be serviced through, which medium to be communicated through, and how to balance their financial resources with their financial obligations. During 2016, our offerings have changed to embrace these tenets. As described earlier, new offerings will further this evolution of the traditional Debt Resolve service with offerings for the large enterprise customer, small and medium businesses, and the consumer.

Lastly, we recognized the opportunity that we, as a publicly held company, could offer to small successful businesses that populate much of our industries. Partnering with Debt Resolve offers these companies the equity benefits of a publicly held company and an exit strategy that will be on their terms rather than those of an unknown buyer. Working together, their business will grow faster, utilizing the financial and senior management skills available from Debt Resolve. The attractiveness of these potential benefits were validated in 2015 by the companies that are currently partnering with us or in partnership discussions with us. 
 
Our Industry
 
Debt Collections Industry
 
According to the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, consumer credit has increased from $133.7 billion in 1970 to $3,543.9 billion in January 2016, a compound annual growth rate of approximately 7.3% for the period. In parallel, the accounts receivables management ("ARM") industry accounts for $15 billion in annual revenues according to industry analyst Kaulkin Ginsberg.
 
There are several major collection industry trends:
 

· | Profit margins are stagnating or declining due to the fixed costs of telephone-based collections. In addition, periods when the economy is weak means more delinquencies to collect but a higher inability on the part of debtors to pay. Thus, costs increase to generate the same level of revenue. The ACA International's 2012 Benchmarking & Agency Operations Survey shows that more than 50% of the operating costs are directly related to the cost of the collections agents, making the business difficult to scale using traditional staffing and collections methods.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Small to mid-size agencies will need to offer competitive pricing and more services to compete with larger agencies, as well as focus on niche areas that require specialized expertise. 
· | Off-shoring has been used by both creditors and third-party collectors, but their results were less than expected due to cultural differences. 
· | Healthcare industry has been hit by rising costs, increased patient deductibles, and a significant increase in high deductible plans available on the government health insurance exchanges. These factors have caused patient out-of-pocket costs to double in the last 5 years. This combined with a reduction in available consumer credit have created a huge burden for Healthcare providers, including increased delinquency resulting in slower payments and increased patient account defaults. 

Federal Student Loan Document Preparation Industry
 
In 1992, President H.W. Bush signed the first bill authorizing U.S. government backed student loans. The William D. Ford Federal Direct loan Program, in 2007, was the beginning of Department of Education involvement in the issuance of student loans directly to students. Then, in 2010, President Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (HCERA), beginning government programs aimed at reducing the cost and burden of these Federal Direct Student Loan repayment for new graduates. Subsequently, in 2012 and 2015, President Obama signed Executive orders to expand these programs to all Federal Direct Student Loan borrowers who have graduated from 2007 to present. While there are three separate programs, they all fall into the categories of Income Based Repayment Plans, known as 'Pay as you Earn' and 'Student Loan Forgiveness'. 
 
Companies in this industry, 1) advise the clients on the availability and details of each program, 2) determine an initial estimate of the loan modification and subsequent cost savings available for the client, 3) with input from the clients, prepare the documentation for submission to the U. S. Department of Education (DOE), 4) with client approval, submit the documentation to DOE on the client's behalf. Based on the data provided, DOE responds with an offer of loan consolidation or modification directly to the client. For the work processed on behalf of the client, companies charge a fee.

While many companies in the industry end their services upon submission, others offer to monitor the clients account for delinquency and work with clients on the required annual renewal submissions to DOE. One mistake removes the client from the DOE program and restores the client's higher student loan payment requirement. For these services, an additional small fee is usually paid. 
 
The opportunity within this industry is significant. As of 2015, over 20 million students per year were graduating with student loan debt, both Federal and private. Since the 2010 HCERA, government subsidies for private loans has ended and the majority of student loans are Federal. The gravity of the student loan burden is reflected in this data: DOE states that as of FY 2015 Q3, there is $98 billion in Federal Loans in default (unpaid for over 270 days), which represents 7 million borrowers. The DOE programs are complicated and many consumers have difficulties selecting the correct program and completing the appropriate documentation without assistance. In addition, the first line of support to these consumers should be the DOE approved Student Loan Processors, who are paid on how much they collect. However, student loan processors have not done a good job in providing this assistance, perhaps because of the dilemma they face. If they help the consumer reduce their student loan payments, they reduce their collections and revenues. Much like the tax preparation industry, where everybody can do their own tax forms but don't, complicated government forms and programs have created a need for the Federal Student Loan document preparation services.
 
Technology License and Proprietary Technology
 
At the core of our Debt Resolve Solution and Settl.it online product is a patent-protected bidding methodology co-invented by the co-founders of our company. We originally entered into a license agreement in February 2003 with the co-founders for the licensed usage of the intellectual property rights relating to U.S. Patent No. 6,330,551, issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on December 11, 2001 for "Computerized Dispute and Resolution System and Method" worldwide. This patent, which expires August 5, 2018, covers automated and online, double blind-bid systems that generate high-speed settlements by matching offers and demands in rounds. Four subsequent patents have been issued and form a five patent "cluster" underpinning our license agreement. In June 2005, we amended and restated the license agreement in its entirety. The license agreement can be found in our SEC filings.
 
The licensed usage is limited to the creation of software and other code enabling an automated system used solely for the settlement and collection of delinquent, defaulted and other types of credit card receivables and other consumer debt and specifically excludes the settlement and collection of insurance claims, tax and other municipal fees of all types. The licensed usage also includes the creation, distribution and sale of software products or solutions for the same aim as above and with the same exclusions. In lieu of cash royalty fees, the co-founders have agreed to accept stock options to purchase shares of our common stock.
 
The term of the license agreement extends until the expiration of the last-to-expire patents licensed (now 5 patents) and is not terminable by the co-founders, the licensors. The license agreement also provides that we will have the right to control the ability to enforce the patent rights licensed to us against infringers and defend against any third-party infringement actions brought with respect to the patent rights licensed to us subject, in the case of pleadings and settlements, to the reasonable consent of the co-founders. The terms of the license agreement, including the exercise price and number of stock options granted under the agreement, were negotiated in an arm's-length transaction between the co-founders, on the one hand, and our independent directors, on the other hand.
 
Technology and Service Providers
 
We outsource our web hosting to CyrusOne LLC, a Tier 1 data center providing our security in a SSAE 16 and PCI certified environment. The CyrusOne hosting facility is located in Wappingers Falls, New York. We use CyrusOne's servers to operate our proprietary software developed in our corporate offices.

Competition
 
Internet-based technology was introduced to the collections industry in 2004 and has many participants at this time. A large number of collection agency software providers now offer an internet payment portal included with their software. 
 
There are many new competitors entering the online collections market at this time. We are very closely monitoring their functionality to prevent an infringement of our patented settlement engine. Several cease and desist letters were sent in 2012 and 2014 to potential infringers to stop using technology that appears to use our protected process, and we will vigorously enforce our rights to protect our technology. 
 
The Federal Student Loan document preparation industry is comprised of numerous small companies. Due to the relative newness of the industry, little data is available on the economics of participation. What is known is the cost of entry into the market is low, but the cost of compliance and adherence to regulatory guidelines is significant. This may explain the churn of small competitors into and out of the business. Those who decide to keep their costs low by ignoring regulators, do so at their own risk. State Attorneys General are keenly aware of some abuses in this industry and have taken action against the offending competitors. 
 
Government Regulation
 
We believe that our traditional Internet technology business is not subject to any regulations by governmental agencies other than those routinely imposed on corporate and Internet technology businesses. We believe it is unlikely that state or foreign regulators would take the position that our solutions effectively constitute the collection of debts that is subject to licensing and other laws regulating the activities of collection agencies, as we have no client funds in our custody at any time. We simply provide a software suite that our clients use to conduct their business.
 
Also, as we move into the healthcare space, our healthcare clients have required us to include in their contracts with us that we meet the data protection provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. This law is designed to ensure that patient care data is not personally identifiable in the event of a breach of our solutions. Again, this type of information is very susceptible to misuse in the commission of identity theft. We believe we have adequate policies and procedures in place to protect this information.
 
Our joint-venture, Student Loan Care LLC, operates within the sphere of influence of the U.S. Department of Education and could be impacted by any ensuing regulatory change. In addition, the laws under which DOE issues student loans and subsequent loan modification and forgiveness could be subject to new laws or Presidential orders. 
 
Employees
 
As of April 17, 2016, we had two full-time employees and one independent contractor. Our employees and contractor are based at our corporate headquarters in White Plains, New York. Our majority owned joint venture, Student Loan Care LLC employs 41 full time employees in Santa Ana, CA. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relations with our employees and contractor are good.
