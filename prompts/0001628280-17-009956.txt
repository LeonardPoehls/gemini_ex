Item 1. Business
JRjr33, Inc. is a global platform of direct-to-consumer brands offering one "product," a business opportunity for independent sales representatives. The Company views itself as a place where independent sales representatives, around the world, can pursue earning opportunities at their own pace, using company-provided systems, including back office and e-commerce tools, to enhance their ability to serve customers. The Company provides an opportunity for the representatives to earn income for their families and have the freedom to decide how much time and effort to put into their business.
In April 2007, the Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware under the name Cardio Vascular Medical Device Corporation. In June 2011, the Company converted to a Florida corporation. During the conversion, the Company changed its name to Computer Vision Systems Laboratories, Corp. On May 27, 2013, the Company once again changed its name, this time to CVSL Inc. ("CVSL"). On September 25, 2012, the Company completed an initial share exchange whereby the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Happenings Communications Group, Inc., a magazine publisher, in exchange for 21,904,302 shares of the Company's common stock representing approximately 90.0% of the Company's issued and outstanding capital stock at such time. On October 16, 2014, the Company effected a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of the Company's authorized, issued, and outstanding common stock.. On March 7, 2016, the Company changed its name to JRjr33, Inc. and began doing business as JRjr Networks. Since January 28, 2016, the Company’s common stock has traded under the stock symbol "JRJR."'
Competition
The Company operates in an industry with numerous manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of consumer goods. The market for products is intensely competitive. Many competitors, such as Avon Products Inc., Tupperware Brands Corp. and others are significantly larger, have greater financial resources, and have more name recognition. The Company relies on the independent sales representatives to market and sell the products through direct marketing techniques. The ability to compete with other direct marketing companies depends greatly on the ability to attract and retain qualified independent sales representatives. In addition, the Company currently does not have significant patent or other proprietary protection, and competitors may introduce products with the same or similar ingredients. As a result, the Company may have difficulty differentiating products from competitors’ products and other competing products that enter the market. There can be no assurance that future operations would not be harmed as a result of changing market conditions and future competition.

JRJR Portfolio
The Company's disciplined acquisition strategy is derived from the industry knowledge and operating expertise of the management team, which the Company believes improves the ability to identify, evaluate, and integrate direct-to-consumer companies that can benefit from the Company’s resources, while contributing to the overall growth strategy. The year-over-year growth the Company has experienced is a result of revenue from acquisitions. The Company intends to continue to pursue opportunistic acquisitions and seeks to improve the financial condition of the business by identifying cost efficiencies across its platform of companies. 
Below is the portfolio of companies in order of acquisition. 
Happenings Communications Group ("Happenings") ("HCG")

Today, Dave’s traditions are carried on by John Rochon Jr.. The Longaberger Company remains a premier maker of handcrafted baskets and offers other home and lifestyle products, including pottery, wrought iron, and fabric accessories.

Betterware currently services customers across the U.K. and Ireland.
Segments
The Company shows results for four operating segments, three of which qualify as reportable segments. The Company has grouped the operating segments into the following product offerings: "gourmet food," "nutritional and wellness," "home décor" and "other." Of these operating segments, the home décor segment, nutritional-and-wellness segment, and gourmet food segment qualify as reportable segments under the SEC reporting regulations.
Each identified reportable segment engages in business activities, incurs expenses, and produces revenue. The operating results of these segments are regularly reviewed by chief operating decision makers ("CODMs") and there is discrete financial information available for each unit. In addition, the gross revenue of each reportable segment, both external and inter-company, equates and/ or exceeds 10% of the Company's consolidated gross revenue. As such, the CODMs view these segments as appropriate for decision making purposes because they each represent a significant part of the business. 
The following is a brief description of each reportable segment:
Home Décor - This segment consists of operations related to the production, sourcing, and sale of premium hand-crafted baskets and the selling of products for the home, including pottery, cleaning, beauty, outdoor, and customizable vinyl expressions for display. These operations are primarily located within the United States and the United Kingdom. Kleeneze, Betterware, Longaberger, and Uppercase Living are the primary subsidiaries involved in this reportable segment.
Nutritional and Wellness - This segment consists of operations related to the selling of nutritional supplements and skin care products. These operations have a presence in approximately 50 countries, such as Italy, Russia, and Thailand. Agel is the primary subsidiary in this reportable segment.
Gourmet Food - This segment consists of operations related to the production and sale of hand-crafted spices, oils and other food products from around the world. These operations have a presence in many of the Company's markets both in the U.S. and internationally such as in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The subsidiaries involved in this line of business are Your Inspiration at Home and My Secret Kitchen.
The Company notes that these three segments exceed 75% of the Company's consolidated revenue. Therefore, no further aggregation or disclosures are required for the remaining operating segments. 
In addition to the reportable segments, the Company has included an "other" segment in all tables to provide increased transparency and ease the reconciliation process to the results found on the consolidated statements of operations. The "other" segment consists of operations related HCG, Paperly, and Tomboy Tools.

Significant Developments
The following is a summary of significant developments affecting the business that have occurred since filing the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Gourmet Food
During 2016 and through the date of this filing, "gourmet food" segment experienced significant declines in revenue. In the short-term, the Company continues to expect revenue to decline compared to the comparable prior year. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the segment's revenue declined $5.6 million and its number of independent sales representatives decreased by 10,000 representatives.
Home Décor
The "home décor" segment has grown compared to the prior year, in large part due to the acquisitions of Kleeneze and Betterware during 2015. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the segment's revenue increased by $17.2 million. The number of independent sales representatives as of December 31, 2016, decreased to 25,000, a decline of 6,000 representatives compared to the number of representatives on December 31, 2015. 
Nutritional and Wellness
The "nutritional and wellness" segment experienced a decline of $5.3 million in revenue during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the prior year. The number of independent sales representatives as of December 31, 2016, decreased by 1,000 representatives compared to the number of representatives on December 31, 2015. The Company expects the revenue and the number of independent sales representatives to decline during the fiscal year ended 2017, as the Company repositions Agel by focusing on markets that management views as better profit potential. The segment's independent sales representatives count went from 13,000 independent sales representatives at December 31, 2016, to 3,000 representatives as of September 30, 2017. 
Publishing and Printing
The "publishing and printing" segment was previously reported in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This former segment is now included in the "other" segment. There have been no significant developments that have occurred since the filing of the 2015 Annual Report of Form 10-K.

Marketing, Manufacturing and Distribution
Currently, the Company has sales in approximately 50 countries with the largest concentration of sales and independent sale representative based in the United States and Europe.
Direct Selling Industry
Direct selling is a well-established sales channel where products are marketed directly to customers, eliminating the need for middlemen, wholesalers, advertisers and retailers. The global direct selling market is a growing $184 billion industry, per the 2016 World Federation of Direct Selling Associations Annual Report. The U.S. portion of the industry alone exceeds $36 billion in annual sales. Worldwide, more than 103 million people are estimated to participate in direct selling. The World Federation of Direct Selling Associations lists the five largest direct selling markets in the world as the United States, China, Korea, Germany, and Japan.
Sales to Delivery Process
Orders are placed using the Internet, mail, telephone, fax, and directly with the Company's representatives at customer hosted events. Payments are processed, mostly via credit card, when orders are taken. Once the order is processed, products are manufactured, picked, and packaged for shipping at the respective company's distribution center. The products are then delivered to the customer using a local or national logistic company. In some markets, retail locations are utilized to serve representatives and customers. 
Independent Sales Representatives
The independent sales representatives utilize marketing materials, including catalogues, and the Company's e-commerce platform to advertise products. Nearly all independent sales representatives have a personalized website for customers to place orders, which improves the order-processing accuracy and the efficiency of the independent sales representative's ability to run their business. 
Representatives earn commissions by selling products to their customers. The Company generally does not have arrangements with end-users of products beyond the representatives. No individual representative accounts for more than 1% of revenues. The Company's primary method of increasing the number of independent sales representatives and the consumer base has historically been through the acquisition of direct selling companies.
The independent sales representatives are independent contractors, compensated based on the revenue generated for the Company, the performance of the representatives they recruit ("down-line representatives,") and their customers. Representatives do not receive a fee for recruiting down-line representatives. The representatives are responsible for the recruiting and training of their down-line representatives. The representatives have an incentive to recruit additional representatives in order to increase the potential revenue produced by their down-line. The independent sales representatives are compensated by their personal sales as well as the sales of their down-line representatives.
Raw Materials
The Company is not materially dependent on any single supplier for raw materials or finished goods. Raw materials are purchased from numerous domestic and international suppliers. Sufficient raw materials were available during the fiscal year 2016. The Company does not believe there will be any issues regarding the accessibility to raw materials. Alternative suppliers of raw materials are readily available if the current suppliers were to become unavailable.
Manufacturing
The Company currently manufactures select product offerings for the home décor and gourmet food segments. The Company operates manufacturing facilities in the United States and Australia. The largest manufacturing facility, is currently leased from NNN Raiders as part of the leaseback agreement discussed in Part II, Item. 8, Note (12), Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
The Company primarily utilizes third party manufacturers to produce many of the products ordered. One of the largest third party manufactures during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was Actitech, which is owned by Michael Bishop, a member of the Board of Directors. Actitech supplied many of Agel's products out of a 600,000-square foot manufacturing facility in Sherman, Texas. As of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Actitech is no longer supplying product to Agel. 
10

For additional details, see Part II, Item. 8, Note (9), Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
The Company believes that there are several alternative manufacturing suppliers that can be utilized if needed.
Distribution
To achieve economies of scale, optimal pricing, and uniform quality, the Company relies primarily on a few principal delivery companies for the delivery of goods. The Company believes that several alternative delivery suppliers exist that could replace the current suppliers, if needed.
11

Intellectual Property
The Company has acquired numerous registered trademarks relating to acquisitions that have been consummated and intend to maintain the acquired trademarks in markets that justify the cost of such compliance. The Company owns trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in foreign jurisdictions. Registration of a trademark enables the registered owner of the trademark to bar the unauthorized use of the registered trademark in connection with similar products in the same channel of trade by any third-party in the respective country of registration, regardless of whether the registered owner has ever used the trademark in the area where the unauthorized use occurs.
Under common law, the Company claims ownership and protection of certain product names, unregistered trademarks, and service marks. Common law trademark rights do not provide the same level of protection that is afforded by the registration of a trademark. In addition, common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is used. The Company believes these trademarks, whether registered or claimed under common law, constitute valuable assets, adding to recognition of the brands and the effective marketing of products. The Company intends to maintain and keep current trademark registrations and to pay all applicable renewal fees as they become due that are necessary for the continued use in the business, as long as enough capital is available to do so and the renewal fees are justifiable for such cost of compliance. The right of a trademark owner to use its trademarks, however, is based on a number of factors, including their first use in commerce, and trademark owners can lose trademark rights despite trademark registration and payment of renewal fees. Therefore, the Company believes that these proprietary rights have been and will continue to be important for current and future operations. If for any reason the trademarks are not able to be maintained, sales of the related products bearing such trademarks could be materially and negatively affected. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.
The Company owns certain intellectual property, including trade secrets that seek to protect the intellectual property, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties. None of the current product offerings are protected by patents, thus confidentiality agreements, and similar agreements, are often the only form of protection to the Company. Even where these agreements exist, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that adequate remedies for any breach exist, or that the trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors. Proprietary product formulations are generally considered trade secrets, but are not otherwise protected under intellectual property laws.
The Company intends to protect the legal rights concerning intellectual property by all appropriate legal action. Consequently, the Company may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights. Any patent litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel.
12

Government Regulation
The direct selling industry is subject to a number of federal and state regulations administered by the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and various state agencies in the United States, as well as regulations regarding direct selling activities in foreign markets. 
Laws specifically applicable to direct selling companies generally are directed at preventing deceptive or misleading marketing and sales practices. These laws often include laws referred to as "pyramid" or "chain sales" scheme laws. These "pyramid" scheme laws are focused on ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to the end consumers and that advancement within a sales organization is based on sales of products and services, rather than investments in the organization, recruiting other participants, or other non-retail sales-related criteria. 
The regulatory requirements concerning direct selling programs involve a high level of subjectivity and are subject to judicial interpretation. The Company is subject to the risk that these laws or regulations, or the enforcement or interpretation of these laws and regulations by governmental agencies or courts, can change. Any direct selling company owned or acquired in the future, could be found not to be in compliance with the current or newly adopted laws and/ or regulations in one or more markets, which could prevent the Company from conducting business in those markets and harm the prospects, business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and stock price of the Company. 
The Company maintains awareness of any pending judicial actions and investigations against other companies in the direct selling industry. Adverse decisions in these cases could impact the business if "pyramid" scheme laws are interpreted more narrowly or in a manner that results in additional burdens or restrictions on the direct selling industry in that representative market. The implementation of such regulations may be influenced by public attention directed toward a direct selling company, its products, or its direct selling program, such that extensive adverse publicity could result in increased regulatory scrutiny. If any government were to ban or restrict the business model, the Company's prospects, business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
Products and related promotional and marketing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation by numerous governmental agencies and authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA,") FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Department of Agriculture, State Attorneys General, and other state regulatory agencies in the United States; and the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan, and similar government agencies in each market in which the Company operates. 
Government authorities regulate advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy and benefits of products. These regulatory authorities typically require adequate and reliable scientific substantiation to support any marketing claims. What constitutes such reliable scientific substantiation can vary widely from market to market. There can be no assurance that the research and development efforts that would be undertaken to support the Company's claims will be deemed adequate for any particular product or claim. If the Company is unable to show adequate and reliable scientific substantiation for product claims, marketing materials, or the claims of the sales force that exceed the scope of allowed claims for nutritional supplements, spices, or skin care products, the FDA, or another regulatory authority could take enforcement action which could harm the business by requiring a revision of marketing materials, amendment of claims, or stoppage of product sales.
The Company trains the independent sales representatives on the regulations and attempts to monitor the sales representative’s marketing materials and claims. Even with these actions, the Company cannot ensure that all such representative activity and corresponding marketing materials comply with applicable regulations. If the independent sales representatives fail to comply with the restrictions, then the Company and the independent sales representatives could be subjected to claims, financial penalties, mandatory product recalls, or relabeling requirements, any of which could harm the consolidated results of operations and/ or financial condition of the Company. Although the Company takes responsibility for the actions of the independent sales representatives, in such an instance, the Company would be dependent on a determination that the Company either controlled or condoned a non-compliant advertising practice. There can be no assurance that the Company could not be held vicariously liable for the actions of the independent sales representatives.
In the United States, FDA regulations on "Good Manufacturing Practices" and "Adverse Event Reporting" requirements for the nutritional supplement industry require the Company and suppliers to maintain a good manufacturing processes, including stringent supplier qualifications, ingredient identification, manufacturing controls and record keeping. The Company is also required to report serious adverse events associated with consumer use of products. The Company's operations could be harmed if regulatory authorities make determinations that the Company, or the suppliers, are not in compliance with these regulations or public reporting of adverse events harms the Company's reputation for quality and safety. A finding of non-compliance may result in administrative warnings, penalties, or actions impacting the Company's ability to continue selling certain products. In addition, compliance with 
13

these regulations has increased, and may further increase the cost of manufacturing certain products as the Company works with the suppliers to assure they are qualified and in compliance.
There are an increasing number of laws and regulations being promulgated by the U.S. government, governments of individual states, and governments overseas that pertain to the Internet and doing business online. In addition, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals are under consideration by federal, state, local, and foreign governments and agencies.
As a U.S. entity operating through subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions, the Company is subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing, and customs laws that regulate the flow of funds between the Company and subsidiaries for product purchases, management services, and contractual obligations, such as the payment of sales commissions.
Like companies that operate in similar product categories, from time to time, the Company receives inquiries from government regulatory authorities regarding the nature of the business and other issues, such as compliance with local direct selling, transfer pricing, customs, taxation, foreign exchange control, securities, and other laws.

Human Resources
As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately 499 and 582 employees, respectively, as measured by full-time equivalence. The employees are not represented by a union or any other collective bargaining group. The Company has a good relationship with its employees.
