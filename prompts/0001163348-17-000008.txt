Item 1. | Business

Overview
We are a Swiss-based holding company headquartered in Switzerland, whose subsidiaries provide innovative property, casualty and specialty insurance and reinsurance solutions to clients worldwide. We were formed in Bermuda in 2001 and have continued to maintain significant insurance and reinsurance operations there following our redomestication to Switzerland in 2010.

As of December 31, 2016, we had $13.2 billion of total assets and $3.6 billion of shareholders’ equity. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our North American Insurance segment accounted for 60.5%, our Global Markets Insurance segment accounted for 16.4% and our Reinsurance segment accounted for 23.1% of our total gross premiums written of $3,065.8 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 1,380 full-time employees. We believe that our employee relations are good.

Recent Developments
On December 18, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited, a Canadian corporation (“Fairfax”), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Holdings will be acquired by Fairfax (the “Acquisition”). The Acquisition has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies.
1

The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, a subsidiary of Fairfax will commence an exchange offer (the “Offer”) to purchase all outstanding shares of Holdings (the “Allied World Shares”), followed by a merger of Holdings into a merger subsidiary of Fairfax (“Merger Sub”), with Merger Sub as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”). Each Allied World Share accepted by Fairfax in the Offer is to be exchanged for the right to receive (i) a $5.00 pre-closing cash dividend from Holdings (the “Special Dividend”), which will be paid outside of the Offer, (ii) $5.00 in cash, subject to adjustment as described below (the “Cash Consideration”), (iii) the Fixed Exchange Stock Consideration (as defined below) and (iv) the Fixed Value Stock Consideration (as defined below and, together with the Fixed Exchange Stock Consideration, the “Stock Consideration”). Fairfax may elect, in its sole discretion, at any time on or prior to March 3, 2017, to increase the amount of the Cash Consideration from $5.00 to an amount not exceeding $35.00, which will correspondingly serve to reduce the Fixed Value Stock Consideration. “Fixed Exchange Stock Consideration” means a fraction of a fully paid and nonassessable subordinate voting share, without par value, of Fairfax (“Fairfax Share”) equal to 0.030392. “Fixed Value Stock Consideration” means a fraction of a Fairfax Share equal to the quotient of (x) $40.00 minus the Cash Consideration minus the Special Dividend divided by (y) the Acceptance Time Parent Share Price (as defined below); provided, (i) if the Acceptance Time Parent Share Price is greater than or equal to $485.65, the Fixed Value Stock Consideration will equal the quotient of (x) $40.00 minus the Cash Consideration minus the Special Dividend divided by (y) $485.65; and (ii) if the Acceptance Time Parent Share Price is less than or equal to $435.65, the Fixed Value Stock Consideration will equal the quotient of (x) $40.00 minus the Cash Consideration minus the Special Dividend divided by (y) $435.65. “Acceptance Time Parent Share Price” means the volume weighted average price per Fairfax Share on the Toronto Stock Exchange for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the trading day before the acceptance time of the Offer (the “Acceptance Time”), in each case converted into U.S. Dollars based on the average currency conversion rate as measured over such 20-day period.
The obligation of Fairfax to consummate the Offer is subject to customary conditions, including (i) approval by Holdings’ shareholders to amend its Articles of Association to permit a holder of 10% or more of Allied World Shares outstanding with full voting rights, to elect the individuals designated by Fairfax to Allied World’s board of directors upon or after completion of the Offer and to approve the Special Dividend and forgo the previously approved $0.26 quarterly dividend to be paid in March 2017; (ii) to the extent required by applicable laws and regulations (based on the total number of Fairfax Shares to be issued as consideration for the Acquisition), approval by Fairfax’s shareholders of the issuance of Fairfax Shares as consideration for the Acquisition; (iii) a number of Allied World Shares having been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn that represents 90% of Allied World Shares outstanding (provided that, in the event all of the other conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or waived, Fairfax may elect in its sole and absolute discretion to waive the 90% condition down to 66 2/3%); (iv) receipt of governmental consents and approvals (both domestic and foreign) required to consummate the Offer and the Merger; and (v) other customary conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. The obligation of each party to consummate the Acquisition is also conditioned upon the other party’s representations and warranties being true and correct and the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Merger Agreement. 
The Merger Agreement provides for certain payments upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances. If the Merger Agreement is terminated by us or Fairfax as a result of an adverse change in the recommendation of the other party’s board of directors, we may be required to pay to Fairfax, or Fairfax may be required to pay to us, a termination fee of $196 million. 
The closing of the Acquisition is currently anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 2017. There can be no assurances that the Acquisition will occur.
For the complete text of the Merger Agreement, see Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 20, 2016. In addition, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Acquisition” in this Form 10-K and Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Our Strategy

Our business objective is to generate attractive returns on equity and book value per share growth for our shareholders. We seek to achieve this objective by executing the following strategies: 

• | Capitalize on profitable underwriting opportunities. Our management and underwriting teams are positioned to identify business with attractive risk/reward characteristics. We pursue a strategy that emphasizes profitability, not market share. Key elements of this strategy are prudent risk selection, appropriate pricing and adjusting our business mix to remain flexible and opportunistic. We seek ways to take advantage of underwriting opportunities that we believe will be profitable. 

2


• | Exercise underwriting and risk management discipline. We believe that we exercise underwriting and risk management discipline by: (i) maintaining a diverse spread of risk across product lines and geographic regions, (ii) managing our aggregate property catastrophe exposure through the application of sophisticated modeling tools, (iii) monitoring our exposures on non-property catastrophe coverages, (iv) adhering to underwriting guidelines across our business lines and (v) fostering a culture that focuses on enterprise risk management and strong internal controls. 


• | Employ a diversified investment strategy. We believe that we follow a diversified investment strategy designed to emphasize the preservation of capital, provide adequate liquidity for the prompt payment of claims and generate returns for our shareholders. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of investment-grade, fixed-maturity securities of short-to medium-term duration. 

Competition 
Competition in the insurance and reinsurance industry is substantial. Our competitors include other stock companies, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations, including major U.S. and non-U.S. companies, some of which have longer operating histories, more capital and/or more favorable ratings than we do, as well as greater marketing, management and business resources. In addition, risk-linked securities, derivatives, captive companies and other alternative risk transfer vehicles, many of which are offered by entities other than insurance and reinsurance companies, also compete with us. The availability of these non-traditional products could reduce the demand for both traditional insurance and reinsurance products.

Market participants compete on the basis of many factors, including premium rates, policy terms and conditions, quality of service, claims handling service and expertise, and reputation and experience in the risks underwritten.  Our ability to continue to compete is dependent on a number of variables, particularly our ability to maintain appropriate financial strength ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies. For more information concerning our financial strength ratings, see “— Financial Strength Ratings”.
Our Operating Segments
 We have three business segments: North American Insurance, Global Markets Insurance and Reinsurance. These segments and their respective lines of business and products may, at times, be subject to different underwriting cycles. We modify our product strategy as market conditions change and new opportunities emerge by developing new products, targeting new industry classes or de-emphasizing existing lines. Our diverse underwriting skills and flexibility allow us to concentrate on the business lines where we expect to generate the greatest returns. Each of our segments utilizes significant gross limit capacity. 
Financial data relating to our three segments is included in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
The gross premiums written in each segment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31, 2016 | | Year Ended December 31, 2015 | | Year Ended December 31, 2014

North American Insurance Segment
General
The North American Insurance segment is comprised of our direct insurance operations in the United States, Bermuda and Canada. This segment includes the direct insurance operations of:

• | Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd, a registered Class 4 Bermuda insurance and reinsurance company that writes business from its office in Bermuda; and

3


• | Allied World Insurance Company, Allied World Assurance Company (U.S.) Inc., Allied World National Assurance Company, Allied World Specialty Insurance Company and Allied World Surplus Lines Insurance Company, which are authorized or eligible to write insurance on both a surplus lines and admitted basis throughout the United States.

 Within this segment, we provide a diverse range of specialty liability products, with a particular emphasis on coverages for casualty and professional liability risks. Additionally, we offer a selection of direct general property and healthcare insurance products. Our Bermuda operations underwrite primarily larger, Fortune 1000 casualty and property risks for clients domiciled in North America, while our operations in the United States and Canada generally write small- and middle-market, non-Fortune 1000 accounts domiciled in North America, including public entities, private companies and non-profit organizations. Our underwriters are spread among our 12 offices in the United States, Bermuda and Canada because we believe it is important to be present in the markets where we compete for business. We believe that over the years we have become a significant writer of casualty, professional liability and other specialty liability coverages, and we intend to continue to seek attractive opportunities in the North American market. 
The table below illustrates the breakdown of the company’s North American direct insurance gross premiums written by line of business for the year ended December 31, 2016.

 | Year Ended December 31, 2016 
 | Amount | | % of Total
 | ($ in millions) 
Casualty | $ | 582.1 | | | 31.4 | %
Professional liability | 485.3 | | | 26.1 | %

Products and Customer Base
Our operations focus on insuring specialty liability risks, such as professional liability, environmental liability, product liability, healthcare liability and commercial general liability risks. We regularly assess our product mix, and we evaluate new products and markets where we believe our underwriting and service will allow us to differentiate our offerings. We offer professional liability products, including policies covering directors and officers, employment practices, fiduciary liability insurance, and mergers and acquisitions. We also offer errors and omissions liability policies designed for a variety of service providers, including law firms, technology companies, insurance companies, insurance agents and brokers, and municipalities. In addition, we provide both primary and excess liability and other casualty coverages to the healthcare industry, including hospitals and hospital systems, managed care organizations, accountable care organizations and other medical service providers. 

With respect to general casualty products, we provide both primary and excess capacity, and our focus is on complex liability risks in a variety of industries, including construction, real estate, public entities, retailers, manufacturing, transportation, and financial and insurance services. We also offer comprehensive insurance to contractors and their employees working outside of the United States on contracts for agencies of the U.S. government or foreign operations of U.S. companies. 
Our property insurance operations focus on direct coverage of physical property and business interruption coverage for commercial property risks as well as inland marine business. We write solely commercial coverages and concentrate on primary risk layers of insurance (as opposed to excess layers). This means that we are typically part of the first group of insurers that cover a loss up to a specified limit. We offer general property products from our underwriting platforms in North America and cover risks for retail chains, real estate, manufacturers, hotels and casinos, and municipalities.

Global Markets Insurance Segment
General
The Global Markets Insurance segment includes all of our direct insurance operations outside of North America. This segment includes the direct insurance operations of:

• | Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd, operating from its branch offices in Asia and Australia;


• | Allied World Assurance Company (Europe) dac, which is incorporated in Ireland and writes business primarily originating from the United Kingdom and Continental Europe;


• | Allied World Assurance Company, AG, which is incorporated in Switzerland and writes business from its office in Zug, Switzerland and is also approved to operate a branch office in Bermuda; and


• | Allied World Managing Agency Limited, which is incorporated in the United Kingdom and is the managing agent of our Lloyd’s Syndicate 2232.

We operate primarily in Europe and Asia Pacific and have an office in Miami that underwrites Latin American risks. While our European offices have historically focused on mid-sized to large European and multi-national companies domiciled outside of North America, we continue to expand our product offerings for small- and middle-market accounts and for specialty classes of business with global exposures. We underwrite a variety of professional liability, general casualty, healthcare liability, property, marine, onshore construction and personal lines products from our offices in Asia Pacific. In addition, Syndicate 2232 writes international property, general casualty and professional liability, marine, aviation and on-shore construction targeted either at key territories or where our customers have requested a Lloyd’s policy. Our staff in the Global Markets Insurance segment is spread among our offices in Dublin, Hong Kong, Labuan, London, Singapore, Sydney and Zug because we believe it is important to be present in the markets where we compete for business.
The table below illustrates the breakdown of the company’s Global Markets insurance gross premiums written by line of business for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Reinsurance Segment
General
Our Reinsurance segment includes the reinsurance of property, general casualty, professional liability, specialty lines and property catastrophe coverages, including property catastrophe coverage written by other reinsurance companies. This segment includes the reinsurance operations of:

• | Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd, operating from its office in Bermuda and branch offices in Asia;


• | Allied World Assurance Company (Europe) dac, which is incorporated in Ireland and writes business through its office in London;


• | Allied World Assurance Company, AG, which is incorporated in Switzerland and writes reinsurance business from its office in Zug, Switzerland;


• | Allied World Reinsurance Management Company, which is licensed to write as a managing general underwriter for our U.S. reinsurance company; and


• | Allied World Managing Agency Limited, which is incorporated in the United Kingdom and is the managing agent of our Lloyd’s Syndicate 2232.

In order to diversify our portfolio and complement our direct insurance business, we write reinsurance on both a treaty and a facultative basis and target several niche markets, including professional liability lines, specialty casualty, property for U.S. regional insurers, accident and health, marine, aerospace and crop risks. Overall, we strive to diversify our reinsurance portfolio through the appropriate combination of business lines, ceding source, geography and mix of product between quota share and excess-of-loss treaties. Our primary customer focus is on highly-rated carriers with proven underwriting skills and dependable operating models. 
We determine appropriate pricing either by using pricing models built or approved by our actuarial staff or by relying on established pricing set by our pricing actuaries for a specific treaty. Pricing models are generally used for facultative reinsurance, property catastrophe reinsurance, property per risk reinsurance, workers compensation and personal accident catastrophe reinsurance. Other types of reinsurance rely on actuarially-established pricing. On a written basis, reinsurance business is more heavily weighted to the first three months of the year.
The table below illustrates the breakdown of the company’s reinsurance gross premiums written by line of business for the year ended December 31, 2016.

 | Year Ended December 31, 2016 
 | Amount | | % of Total
 | ($ in millions) 
Property | $ | 362.0 | | | 51.2 | %
Specialty | 176.4 | | | 25.0 | % 
Casualty | 167.8 | | | 23.8 | % 
 | $ | 706.2 | | | 100.0 | %

Product Lines and Customer Base
The principal sources of revenue for this segment are property, casualty and specialty reinsurance. The insurers we reinsure range from single state to nationwide insurers located in the United States as well as specialty carriers or the specialty divisions of standard lines carriers. For our non-U.S. reinsurance business, our clients include multi-national insurers, single territory insurers, niche carriers and Lloyd’s syndicates. We focus on niche programs and coverages, frequently sourced from excess and surplus lines insurers. We target a portfolio of well-rated companies that are highly knowledgeable in their product lines, have the financial resources to execute their business plans and are committed to underwriting discipline throughout the underwriting cycle.

Our property reinsurance contracts protect insurers who write residential, commercial and industrial accounts globally. We also write Euro-centric business and business for Continental European companies, including through the use of our Swiss operating company, Allied World Assurance Company, AG. Our property reinsurance treaties are structured as either quota share or excess-of-loss. 
Our casualty reinsurance business consists of general casualty and professional liability lines. We write mostly treaty business for global accounts, focused primarily in the United States. Our general casualty treaties cover working layer, intermediate layer and catastrophe exposures. We sell both quota share and excess-of-loss reinsurance. We principally underwrite general liability, auto liability and commercial excess and umbrella liability for both admitted and non-admitted companies. Our professional liability treaties cover several products, primarily directors’ and officers’ liability, but also attorneys’ malpractice, medical malpractice, miscellaneous professional classes and transactional risk liability. The complex exposures undertaken by this unit demand highly technical underwriting and pricing analysis. 
For our specialty reinsurance business, we underwrite on a global basis crop, marine and aviation, and other specialty lines of business, including accident and health business, with an emphasis on catastrophe personal accident programs and workers compensation catastrophe business.
For more information on our gross premiums written by line of business in our Reinsurance segment, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Underwriting Results by Operating Segments — Reinsurance Segment — Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015” and “— Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.”
Distribution
As a commercial insurer, we primarily offer products through independent insurance intermediaries, including retail brokerage firms and excess and surplus lines wholesalers. We typically pay a commission to agents and brokers for business that we accept from them. 
Within our North American Insurance segment, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (“Marsh”) and Aon plc (“Aon”) accounted for 12.7% and 10.7%, respectively, of our gross premiums written in this segment during 2016. 
Our Global Markets Insurance segment maintains significant relationships with Marsh, Aon and Willis Group Holdings (“Willis”), which accounted for 19.4%, 14.3% and 9.3%, respectively, of our gross premiums written in this segment during 2016. 
Due to a number of factors, including transactional size and complexity, the distribution infrastructure of the reinsurance marketplace is characterized by relatively few intermediary firms. As a result, we have close business relationships with a small number of reinsurance intermediaries, and our business during 2016 was primarily with affiliates of Marsh, Aon and Willis, which accounted for 45.3%, 21.1% and 13.5%, respectively, of our gross premiums written in our Reinsurance segment during 2016. 
In our opinion, no material part of our business is dependent upon a single insured or a single group of insureds; however, due to the substantial percentage of premiums produced in our Global Markets Insurance and Reinsurance segments by the top three intermediaries, the loss of business from any one of them could have a material adverse effect on our business. Likewise, the loss of business from Marsh or Aon could have a material adverse effect on our North American insurance business.
Certain of our products within our North American Insurance segment and Global Markets Insurance segment are also underwritten and distributed through third-party program administrators. To help align interests, we seek to establish incentive-based compensation as a component of the fees paid to program administrators, which encourages better long-term underwriting results. We contract with third-party agencies to underwrite a variety of programs. We generally have opted to outsource the claims-handling for these programs given the specialty nature of the business they underwrite. Before delegating underwriting authority, we consider the integrity, experience and reputation of each program administrator, as well as the potential profitability of the business and availability of reinsurance. Once a program is established, we conduct regular ongoing reviews and audits of the program administrator and the claims-handling if it has been outsourced. We do not believe that the loss of any one program or relationship with any one program administrator would have a material adverse effect on our business, and no single program accounts for 10% or more of our total revenues.

Enterprise Risk Management
While the assumption of risk is inherent in our business, we believe that we have developed a strong enterprise risk management (“ERM”) framework that is integrated into the management of our business. Our ERM framework consists of numerous systems, processes and controls designed by our senior management, with oversight by our Board of Directors and its Enterprise Risk Committee, and implemented across our organization to identify, quantify, monitor and, where possible, mitigate internal and external risks that could materially impact our operations, financial condition and reputation. 
One key element of our ERM framework is our economic capital model. Utilizing this modeling framework, we review the relative interaction between risks impacting us from various sources, including our underwriting practices and the investments we make. Our ERM supports our firm-wide, decision-making process by aiming to provide reliable and timely risk information. Our primary ERM objectives are to ensure the sustainability of the enterprise and to maximize our risk-adjusted returns on capital. Our ERM is a dynamic process, with periodic updates being made to reflect organizational processes and the recalibration of our models, as well as staying current with changes within our industry and the global economic environment. 
We have identified the following as the main categories of risk within our business: 
Insurance risk: Risk of fluctuations in benefits payable to policyholders and cedents, including premium or underwriting risk, catastrophe risk and reserve risk.
Investment risk:  Risk arising from fluctuations in the value of, or income from, invested assets, including fluctuations due to movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, credit defaults and/or equity volatility.

Reinsurance credit risk:  The ceding of policies we write to other reinsurers is a principal risk management activity, and it requires careful monitoring of the concentration of our reinsured exposures and the creditworthiness of the reinsurers to which we cede business. 
Operational risk:  Encompasses a wide range of risks related to our operations, including corporate governance, claims settlement processes, regulatory compliance, employment practices, human resources and information technology (“IT”) exposures (including disaster recovery, cyber-security and business continuity planning). 
Our risk governance structure includes committees comprised of senior underwriting, actuarial, finance, legal, investment and operations staff that identify, monitor and help manage each of these risks. Our management-based Risk Management Committee, chaired by our Chief Risk Officer, focuses primarily on identifying correlations among our primary categories of risk, developing metrics to assess our overall risk position, performing risk assessment on an ongoing basis and continually reviewing factors that may impact our organizational risk. This risk governance structure is complemented by our internal audit department, which assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control systems and coordinates risk-based audits and compliance reviews and other specific initiatives to evaluate and address risk within targeted areas of our business as well as our risk-mitigation efforts.

Our management’s ERM efforts are overseen by our Board of Directors, primarily through its Enterprise Risk Committee. This committee, comprised of independent directors, is charged with reviewing and recommending to the Board of Directors our overall firm-wide risk appetite as well as overseeing management’s compliance therewith. Our Enterprise Risk Committee reviews our risk management methodologies, standards, tolerances and risk strategies, and reviews management’s processes for monitoring and aggregating risks across our organization. Our Audit Committee, Investment Committee and Compensation Committee also oversee aspects of our financial, investment and compensation risks, respectively. Internal controls and ERM can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that our control objectives will be met. The possibility of material financial loss remains notwithstanding our ERM efforts. 
Financial Strength Ratings 
Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies. A.M. Best, Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings have each developed a rating system to evaluate an insurer’s or reinsurer’s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to its policyholders. Each rating reflects the rating agency’s opinion of the capitalization, risk management, leadership and sponsorship of the entity to which it relates, and is neither an evaluation directed to investors in our common shares nor a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our common shares. Each rating agency maintains a letter scale rating system, including numerous incremental rating categories: A.M. Best’s rating system includes 15 
8

separate categories, ranging from “A++” (Superior) to “F” (In Liquidation); Moody’s rating system includes 21 separate categories, ranging from “Aaa” (Exceptional) to “C” (Lowest-rated); Standard & Poor’s rating system includes 22 separate categories, ranging from “AAA” (Extremely Strong) to “R” (under regulatory supervision); and Fitch Ratings’ rating system includes 19 separate categories, ranging from “AAA” (Exceptionally Strong) to “C” (Distressed). 
Our operating subsidiaries and their respective ratings from each rating agency are provided in the table below. Each rating is subject to periodic review by, and may be revised upward, downward or revoked at the sole discretion of, the rating agency. A.M. Best, Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings each placed the company's financial strength and credit ratings under review with negative implications following the December 18, 2016 announcement of the Acquisition.

In addition to the above-named subsidiaries, we underwrite through our Lloyd’s Syndicate 2232.

Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses
For information regarding our reserves for losses and loss expenses, including incurred and paid loss development triangles, see Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses.” and Note 7 - “Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses” of the audited consolidated financial statements.
Investments
We believe that we follow a diversified investment strategy designed to emphasize the preservation of our invested assets, provide adequate liquidity for the prompt payment of claims and produce attractive returns for our shareholders. The Investment Committee of our Board of Directors has approved an Investment Policy Statement that contains investment guidelines and supervises our investment strategy, investment activity and investment risk. The Investment Committee regularly monitors our overall investment results and compliance with investment objectives and guidelines set forth in the Investment Policy Statement, and ultimately reports our overall investment results to the Board of Directors.
To help ensure adequate liquidity for the payment of claims, we take into account the maturity and duration of our investment portfolio and our general liability profile. In making investment decisions, we consider the impact of various catastrophic events to which we may be exposed. The majority of our assets are invested in fixed income markets. Our Investment Policy Statement contains restrictions on the maximum amount of our investment portfolio that may be invested in alternative investments (such as hedge funds and private equity vehicles) as well as the minimum amount that must be maintained in investment grade fixed income securities and cash. Our Investment Policy Statement also includes restrictions on

the portfolio’s composition, including limits on issuer type, industry sector, credit quality, portfolio duration, the amount of investments in approved countries and permissible security types. 
For several asset classes, we have entered into investment management agreements with outside investment managers to provide us with certain discretionary investment management services. Engaging investment managers benefits us in a variety of ways, including by providing operational and cost efficiencies, a diversity of investment styles and approaches and introducing us to innovations in research and risk management. In addition, to maintain control over investment managers, we have developed investment guidelines that include restrictions on the permissible security types that our investment managers may include in the portfolios they manage. Our investment management agreements may generally be terminated by either party upon 30 days’ prior written notice.
As of December 31, 2016, we had total investments and cash and cash equivalents of $8.7 billion, including restricted cash, fixed-maturity securities, equity securities, hedge fund, private equity investments and other securities. The average credit quality of our investments is rated A+ by Standard & Poor’s and A1 by Moody’s. Our current Investment Policy Statement requires that short-term instruments must be rated a minimum of A-1, F-1 or P-1 by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch. The target duration range is 1.00 to 4.25 years. The portfolio has a total return rather than income orientation. The average duration of our investment portfolio was 3.0 years as of December 31, 2016.

Regulatory Matters
General
Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries must comply with many laws and regulations in the countries and local jurisdictions where we operate and sell our products. Compliance obligations are increasing in most jurisdictions as the focus on insurance regulatory controls has escalated in recent years, with particular emphasis on regulation of solvency, risk management and internal controls. 
Group Supervision
The Bermuda Monetary Authority (“BMA”) acts as the group supervisor for Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd, our lead insurance and reinsurance subsidiary, which has been named the “designated insurer” for group supervisory purposes. In accordance with the Group Supervisory and Insurance Group Solvency Rules that became effective in January 2012, Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd is required to prepare and submit to the BMA annual group financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), annual group statutory financial statements, annual group statutory financial and capital returns, and unaudited quarterly returns. 
Bermuda 
Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd is subject to the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978 (the “Insurance Act”). The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards as well as auditing and reporting requirements on Bermuda insurers and reinsurers, and it empowers the BMA to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of these companies. There are a number of remedial actions the BMA can take to protect the public interest if it determines that a Bermuda insurer or reinsurer may become insolvent or that a breach of the Insurance Act or of a registration condition has occurred or is about to occur. 
In addition to maintaining a principal office in Bermuda and appointing specified officers, the following are some significant aspects of the Bermuda regulatory framework with which Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd must comply: 
Solvency and Capital Standards.  It must maintain a minimum solvency margin and hold available statutory economic capital and surplus equal to or in excess of its “enhanced capital requirement” and “target capital level” as determined by the BMA under the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement model (the “BSCR model”). The BSCR model is a risk-based capital model that establishes an enhanced capital requirement and total capital level by taking into account risk characteristics specific to an insurer’s business. The target capital level is measured as 120% of the enhanced capital requirements. Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd is also required to maintain a minimum solvency margin that is equal to the greatest of (1) $100,000,000, (2) 50% of net premiums written, (3) 15% of net losses and loss expense reserves and (4) 25% of its 
10

enhanced group capital requirement. As of December 31, 2016, Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd met all the minimum solvency margin and statutory economic capital and surplus requirements. 
Eligible Capital and Liquidity.  It must disclose the makeup of its capital under a “three-tiered capital system,” under which capital instruments are classified as either basic or ancillary capital, and then classified into one of three tiers based on “loss absorbency” characteristics. The minimum and maximum thresholds of tier 1, 2 and 3 capital that may be used to support a company’s minimum solvency margin, enhanced capital requirement and target capital level are determined in accordance with BMA rules. In addition, minimum liquidity must be maintained at a ratio at least equal to the value of relevant assets at not less than 75% of the amount of relevant liabilities.
Dividends.  It is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend during any financial year if it is, or would be after such dividend, in breach of its minimum solvency margin, minimum liquidity ratio or enhanced capital requirements. It must also receive BMA approval prior to declaring or paying within any financial year dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus or reducing its total statutory capital by 15% or more. Additionally, under the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, no Bermuda company may pay a dividend if such company has reasonable grounds for believing that it is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, or that the realizable value of its assets would thereby be less than its liabilities. Lastly, as a condition of the BMA’s agreement to treat the proceeds of the 4.35% senior notes due 2025 as “other fixed capital” to be classified as “tier 2 - ancillary capital” in accordance with the Insurance Act, Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd agreed not to declare or pay any dividend unless it maintains 120% of its enhanced capital requirement and Allied World Switzerland maintains 120% of its enhanced capital requirement.
Code of Conduct.  It must comply with the BMA’s Insurance Code of Conduct, which prescribes the duties, standards, procedures and sound business principles with which all companies registered under the Insurance Act must comply.
Change of Control.  The BMA also requires written notification from any person who, directly or indirectly, becomes a holder of at least 10% of the voting shares of Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd or its parent companies within a stipulated period after becoming such a holder. The BMA may object to such a person if such person is determined to be not fit and proper to be such a holder or it may require the shareholder to reduce its holdings or voting rights.
Switzerland 
Allied World Assurance Company, AG is licensed by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (“FINMA”) to carry on insurance and reinsurance business in specific non-life lines in Switzerland. It must comply with Swiss insurance supervisory laws under regulations and guidance issued by FINMA, and it is required to satisfy capital and solvency requirements, based on a Swiss Solvency Test (which is similar in nature to the methodology applied under the European Union’s Solvency II regime). 
In addition to quantitative risk measures, FINMA requires full qualitative governance and control of risk in the firm, including fitness, propriety and competence of the directors and senior management; observance of ethical standards; objective and appropriate remuneration procedures; management of conflicts of interests; the institution of a compliance function; and independence and adequate resourcing of control functions (including the responsible actuary, the risk management function and the internal audit function). Insurance companies are required to implement documented procedures for risk management and internal controls. 
United States 
Our U.S. insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are admitted or surplus lines eligible in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Allied World Insurance Company is domiciled in New Hampshire and is the lead U.S. subsidiary for regulatory purposes.
The regulation of U.S. insurance and reinsurance companies varies by state. Generally, states regulate insurance holding companies to assure the fairness of inter-affiliate transactions, the propriety of dividends paid to corporate parents and the benefits of any proposed change of control transaction. States also regulate insurer solvency, accounting matters and risk management, as well as a range of operational matters, including authorized lines of business, permitted investments, policy forms and premium rates, maximum single policy risks, adequacy of reserves for losses and unearned premiums and maintenance of in-state deposits for the benefit of policyholders. To monitor compliance, state insurance departments perform periodic market conduct examinations and financial fitness examinations, and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of companies and other matters.

Several of our U.S. companies serve primarily the excess and surplus lines markets and, as such, are subject to somewhat reduced regulation and reporting requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These companies are generally exempt from form and rate pre-approval requirements and from state guaranty fund laws and involuntary pool participation. 
Guaranty Fund Assessments and Involuntary Pools.  Virtually all states require admitted insurers to participate in various forms of guaranty associations in order to bear a portion of the losses to insureds caused by the insolvency of other insurers. Assessments are generally between 1% and 2% of the annual premiums written. Many states also require participation in assigned risk pools involving workers compensation and automobile insurance for insurers active in these specific classes.
Risk-Based Capital.  U.S. insurers are subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) guidelines that provide a method to measure the total adjusted capital (statutory capital and surplus plus other adjustments) taking into account the specific risk characteristics of the insurer’s investments and products. The RBC guidelines establish capital requirements for four categories: asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and business risk. 
Other
Our operating subsidiaries and their respective branch offices do business in or are licensed in the following jurisdictions: Australia, Bermuda, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, Labuan, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States and several jurisdictions in Latin America. As of December 31, 2016, we believe all of our operating subsidiaries and their respective branch offices were in good standing in the jurisdictions in which they operate.
