 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 We are a leader in cyber-security solutions that protect business-critical data and applications, whether in the cloud or on premises. As organizations worldwide undergo digital transformation, their day-to-day operations are increasingly dependent upon their application and data portfolios. Extortion and theft by cybercriminals, using an evolving array of sophisticated attacks, continuously threaten these applications and data. Organizations are facing numerous challenges in providing the visibility and control required to protect business-critical applications and data from these attacks. Adoption of new technologies and architectures, such as mobile applications, web applications and big data, increases the complexity of, opens access to, and increases the vulnerability of business-critical data and applications. The increasing use of virtualization technologies and cloud delivery models, including unsanctioned, employee-adopted applications, known as “shadow IT,” is forcing organizations to operate outside of the traditional security model. Additionally, organizations must comply with complex regulatory standards enacted to protect their systems and data. We believe that these challenges are driving the need for cyber-security solutions that protect applications and data, whether in the cloud or on premises.
 Our cyber-security solutions directly protect the business-critical data and applications that are being attacked, and are designed to fill the gaps left by existing endpoint and network or perimeter security solutions. Our Imperva SecureSphere platform provides database, file and web application security across various physical and virtual systems in data centers, including those in traditional on-premise data centers as well as in private, public and hybrid cloud computing environments. Our Imperva Incapsula product line provides cloud-based website security, denial of service protection and performance solutions that do not require software or hardware changes. Our Imperva CounterBreach product line uses machine learning to analyze how users access data and to spotlight data breach activity. In addition, our cloud offerings are designed to protect against the unique threats created as enterprises increasingly shift to deploying their applications and storing their data in the cloud to take advantage of the flexibility and cost-efficiency offered by cloud-based solutions.
 On December 15, 2016, we acquired specified assets and liabilities of Camouflage Software, Inc., or Camouflage, for approximately $4.5 million in cash and hired nearly all of Camouflage’s employees. Based in St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, Camouflage provides data discovery and data masking tools to protect sensitive and critical data. Prior to the asset purchase, we had announced a technology alliance with Camouflage in May 2016 that allowed us to sell the Camouflage solution to our customers. For more information on the Camouflage acquisition see Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 As of December 31, 2016, Imperva had over 5,200 end user customers in more than 100 countries. For purposes of this end user customer count, we are referring to end user customers who purchased through our direct sales force or channel partners. In addition, our solutions are used to protect thousands of organizations through cloud-based deployments with our Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) customers and managed security service providers (“MSSPs”) and hosting partners. We primarily sell our products and services through our network of approximately 270 channel partners worldwide, including both distributors and resellers, which provide sales and support leverage to our sales organization. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 993 employees, including 319 employees in research and development. We generated revenue of $264.5 million in 2016, an increase of 12.9% over the $234.3 million in revenue we generated in 2015. Net loss attributable to our stockholders was $70.3 million in 2016 as compared to $48.9 million in 2015.  
 On February 23, 2017, we completed the sale of our Skyfence cloud access security broker business to Forcepoint LLC for approximately $40 million. For more information about the sale of the Skyfence business see Note 18 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on subsequent events.

• | Drive increased sales to our existing customer base. We intend to drive increased sales of our suite of cyber-security offerings within our existing customer base by deepening and broadening deployment of our offerings. Many of our customers initially deploy our solution for a limited portion of their business-critical applications and data, providing us with significant opportunities to sell them more of our products. This strategy has proved successful, as more than 52% of our revenue in 2016 was derived from repeat sales to existing customers. In addition, as a leading provider of cyber-security solutions, we believe we are well positioned to benefit as our customers expand the scope of their cyber-security and compliance initiatives both in the cloud and on premises. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 26% of our customers have purchased more than one of our SecureSphere offerings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase our sales in the mid-market and small and medium-sized business (“SMB”) market. We believe there is a significant opportunity to provide cyber-security solutions to smaller businesses as they continue to face increasing security threats and more complex compliance mandates. We plan to continue to grow our business with mid-market enterprises and SMBs by expanding our distribution channels and our cloud-based offerings.

 Intellectual Property
 To protect our intellectual property, both domestically and abroad, we rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws. As of December 31, 2016, we had 33 issued patents and 15 pending patent applications in the United States. The claims for which we have sought patent protection relate primarily to methods, computer programs, devices and systems we have developed for our products. We also license software from third parties for integration into our products, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.  Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of relevant patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. For more information about risks related to our and third party intellectual property rights see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business— Assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and operating results”; “—We rely on the availability of licenses to third-party software and other intellectual property, the loss of which could increase our costs and delay software shipments”; “—Some of our products contain “open source” software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business”; and “—Failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and operating results.”
Manufacturing and Suppliers
 Our security hardware appliance products are manufactured to our specifications by Caswell, Inc., a Taiwanese original design manufacturer of network appliance hardware products. We have entered into non-exclusive contracts to purchase these hardware appliances from American Portwell Technology, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Portwell, Inc.), and Dan-el Technologies Ltd., which are value-added distributors of products manufactured by Caswell, Inc. These contracts will remain in effect until terminated by either party. Such contracts are terminable by us for any reason upon six months’ notice, by the value-added distributors upon nine months’ notice or by either party for an uncured material breach. We currently work with American Portwell Technology and provide the value-added distributors with rolling product demand forecasts, but our contracts contain no obligation for us to purchase any minimum amount of products. We submit purchase orders that describe the types and quantities of our products to be manufactured, the delivery dates and other delivery terms. American Portwell Technology receives the hardware appliances from the manufacturer, configures and installs our proprietary software on the appliances and then undertakes quality testing at their fulfillment centers. American Portwell Technology then ships our appliances directly to our distributors, resellers or customers or our logistics partner, Base Logistics BV. We hold inventory in American Portwell Technology’s fulfillment centers and in our logistics partner’s warehouses, in anticipation of orders for new appliances and to support our advance replacement program with new and repaired appliances. In addition, our contracts with our value-added distributors govern their use of our intellectual property and allocate the responsibilities for warranty repair, out of warranty repair and replacement costs with respect to damaged and defective products. We believe that having third parties manufacture, configure and test our products and provide a substantial portion of our logistics enables us to efficiently allocate capital, better adjust manufacturing volumes to meet changes in demand and more quickly deliver products, allowing us to focus resources on our core competencies.
