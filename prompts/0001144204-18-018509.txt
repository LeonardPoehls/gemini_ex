 Market Area 
 Standard AVB Financial Corp., with total assets of $972.6 million at December 31, 2017, is the parent company of Standard Bank, PaSB, a Pennsylvania chartered savings bank which operates seventeen offices serving individuals and small to mid-sized businesses in Allegheny, Westmoreland and Bedford Counties, in Pennsylvania and Allegany County in Maryland. Standard Bank is a member of the FDIC and an Equal Housing Lender. 
 Standard’s market area has a broad range of private employers, and has changed its focus from heavy industry to more specialized industries and service providers, including technology, health care, education, energy and finance. Westmoreland County is east of Allegheny County and is part of the Pittsburgh

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  metropolitan area. Allegany County, Maryland is part of the Cumberland, Maryland-West Virginia metropolitan area, which is equidistant from Pittsburgh and Baltimore, and its economy includes information technology, biotechnology, medical services and manufacturing. 
 Unemployment rates have continued to drop significantly in the Standard’s market area. The Pittsburgh MSA unemployment rate is nearly even with that of the state. However, the unemployment rate in Allegany County, Maryland is substantially higher than that of the state of Maryland and the national unemployment rate continues to be better than that all of Standard’s market. 
 Due to the broad diversification of industries and employers, Standard’s market area was not severely affected by the economic downturn that began in 2008. Median household income levels in Standard’s market area have been mixed. Allegheny, Westmoreland, Fayette and Butler Counties, Pennsylvania have outpaced the median household income growth for both Pennsylvania and the nation since 2010. In Allegany County in Western Maryland, median household income growth has done better than the state of Maryland and the percentage change for the United States. However, median household income in each of the counties within Standard’s market area, with the exception of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania is substantially less than their respective states and nationally. Allegheny County, Pennsylvania is very close to matching the median household income for both the state and the nation. 
 The population growth in the Standard Bank’s Pittsburgh market area has been relatively flat; similar to that of Pennsylvania. The population in Allegany County, Maryland has declined in contrast to the population growth in the state of Maryland. The median age throughout Standard’s market area is substantially older than that of the nation and respective states. However, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania has seen what may be a reversal of that trend. 
 Competition 
 Standard faces intense competition in its market areas both in making loans and attracting deposits. Standard competes with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and investment banking firms. Some of Standard’s competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that Standard does not or cannot provide. 
 Standard’s deposit sources are primarily concentrated in the communities surrounding its community banking offices, located in the Pennsylvania counties of Allegheny, Westmoreland and Bedford and Allegany County, Maryland. As of June 30, 2017 (the latest date for which information is publicly available), Standard ranked 15th in deposit market share out of 31 bank and thrift institutions with offices in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania with a market share of 0.4%, 9th in deposit market share out of 20 bank and thrift institutions in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania with a market share of 2.9%, 7th in deposit market share out of 9 bank and thrift institutions in Bedford County, Pennsylvania, with a market share of 3.5% and 4th in deposit market share out of 5 bank and thrift institutions in Allegany County, Maryland with a market share of 8.2%. 
 Lending Activities 
 Standard’s primary lending activities are the origination of commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and home equity loans and lines of credit. To a lesser extent, Standard also originates construction loans and consumer loans. 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans.   At December 31, 2017, $301.0 million, or 40.1%, of Standard’s total loan portfolio, consisted of commercial real estate loans. Properties securing Standard’s commercial real estate loans primarily include loans to lessors of residential buildings and dwellings, lessors of non-residential buildings, properties for single family home construction, small office buildings and office suites. Standard generally seeks to originate commercial real estate loans with initial principal balances of up to $6.0 million. Substantially all of Standard’s commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in its primary market area. At December 31, 2017, Standard’s largest commercial real estate loan relationship (consisting of three separate commercial real estate loans) had a combined principal balance of $5.8 million and was secured by two commercial office buildings. These loans were performing in accordance with their terms and conditions at December 31, 2017.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  In the underwriting of commercial real estate loans, Standard generally lends up to the lower of 80% of the property’s appraised value or purchase price. Standard bases its decision to lend primarily on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan, Standard emphasizes the ratio of the property’s projected net cash flow to the loan’s debt service requirement (generally requiring a preferred ratio of 1.25x), computed after deductions for a vacancy factor and property expenses that Standard deems appropriate. Personal guarantees are usually obtained from commercial real estate borrowers. Standard generally requires title insurance, fire and extended coverage casualty insurance, and, if appropriate, flood insurance, in order to protect its security interest in the underlying property. Almost all of Standard’s commercial real estate loans are generated internally by its Commercial Relationship Managers. 
 Commercial real estate loans generally carry higher interest rates and have shorter terms than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Commercial real estate loans entail greater credit risks compared to the one- to four-family residential mortgage loans Standard originates, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income generated from the property to cover both operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial real estate than residential properties. 
 Commercial Business Loans.   Standard makes various types of secured and unsecured commercial business loans to customers in its market area for the purpose of working capital and other general business purposes. The terms of these loans generally range from less than one year to a maximum of ten years. The loans are either negotiated on a fixed-rate basis or carry adjustable interest rates indexed to a market rate index. Standard seeks to originate loans to small- and medium-size businesses with principal balances between $50,000 and $5.0 million. At December 31, 2017, Standard had commercial business loans totaling $56.1 million, or 7.5% of the total loan portfolio. 
 Commercial credit decisions are based upon Standard’s credit assessment of the loan applicant. Standard evaluates the applicant’s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms of the loan and Standard assesses the risks involved. Personal guarantees of the principals are typically obtained. In addition to evaluating the loan applicant’s financial statements, Standard considers the adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment for the loan and debt service coverage. Credit agency reports of the applicant’s personal credit history supplement Standard’s analysis of the applicant’s creditworthiness. Collateral supporting a secured transaction is also analyzed to determine its value and marketability. Commercial business loans generally carry higher interest rates than residential loans of like duration due to a higher risk of default as repayment generally depends on the successful operation of the borrower’s business and the sufficiency of any collateral. At December 31, 2017, Standard’s largest commercial business loan was to a municipality, had a principal balance of $4.8 million and was secured by the full faith and credit and taxing authority of the borrower. This loan was performing in accordance with its terms and conditions at December 31, 2017. 
 One- to Four-Family Residential Mortgage Loans.   At December 31, 2017, $261.7 million, or 34.8%, of Standard’s total loan portfolio, consisted of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Standard offers fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans with maturities up to 30 years. One- to four-family residential mortgage loans are generally underwritten according to secondary market guidelines, and Standard refers to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” Standard generally originates both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which is currently $453,100 for single-family homes. However, loans in excess of $453,100 (which are referred to as “jumbo loans”) may be generally originated for retention in Standard’s loan portfolio or may be sold servicing released. Standard’s portfolio maximum loan amount for these loans is generally $750,000. Standard underwrites jumbo portfolio loans in the same manner as conforming loans. 
 Standard will originate loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80%, up to and including a loan-to-value ratio of 97%. Standard requires private mortgage insurance for loans with loan-to-value 

 4

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  ratios in excess of 80%. During the fiscal ended December 31, 2017, Standard originated $25.7 million of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80%. Standard offers special programs for low- and moderate-income home purchasers within low to moderate income census tracts. The property must be located within Standard’s lending assessment area. Household income must be less than 80% of median income of the Metropolitan Statistical Area in order to qualify for the special low-to moderate-income program. Loans under this program may be originated up to 100% loan to value. 
 Standard generally sells fixed rate conforming loans with terms greater than 15 years and retain the servicing rights on loans sold to generate fee income. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Standard recognized loan servicing fees of $210,000. As of December 31, 2017, the principal balance of loans serviced for others totaled $68.7 million. 
 Other than Standard’s loans for the construction of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans (described under “Construction Loans”) and home equity lines of credit (described under “Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit”), Standard does not offer “interest only” mortgage loans on one- to four-family residential properties (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). Standard also does not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. Standard does not offer “subprime loans” (loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (traditionally defined as loans having less than full documentation). 
 Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit.   In addition to traditional one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, Standard offers home equity loans and home equity lines of credit that are secured by the borrower’s primary residence or secondary residence. At December 31, 2017, Standard’s home equity loans and lines of credit totaled $130.9 million and represented 17.4% of its total loan portfolio. Standard’s home equity loans are originated with fixed rates of interest and with terms of up to 15 years. Home equity lines of credit have a maximum term of 20 years. Standard offers interest only lines of credit with a 10-year draw period in which interest is due monthly. After the initial 10-year draw period, the borrower is required to make principal payments based on a 10-year amortization. Standard’s home equity lines of credit are currently originated with adjustable rates of interest. Home equity loans and lines of credit are generally underwritten with the same criteria that Standard uses to underwrite one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. For a borrower’s primary residence, home equity loans and lines of credit may be underwritten with a loan-to-value ratio of 89.9% and 85%, respectively, when combined with the principal balance of the existing mortgage loan. At the time Standard closes a home equity loan or line of credit, Standard records a mortgage to perfect its security interest in the underlying collateral. At December 31, 2017 Standard’s in-house maximum limit for home equity loans and lines of credit was $750,000. Loans over $400,000 require title insurance. 
 Home equity loans and lines of credit entail greater credit risks compared to the one- to four-family residential mortgage loans Standard originates, as they typically involve higher loan-to-value ratios. Therefore, any decline in real estate values may have a more detrimental effect on home equity loans and lines of credit compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. 
 Construction Loans.   Standard makes commercial construction loans for rental properties, commercial buildings and homes built by developers on speculative, undeveloped property. The terms of commercial construction loans are made in accordance with Standard’s commercial loan policy. Advances on construction loans are made in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of construction, but are generally limited to an 80% loan-to-completed-appraised-value ratio. Repayment of construction loans on non-residential properties is normally expected from the property’s eventual rental income, income from the borrower’s operating entity or the sale of the subject property. In the case of income-producing property, repayment is usually expected from permanent financing upon completion of construction. Standard typically provides the permanent mortgage financing on its construction loans. Construction loans are interest-only loans during the construction period, which typically do not exceed 12 months, and convert to permanent, amortizing financing following the completion of construction. 

 5

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Standard makes residential construction loans for one- to four-family owner-occupied properties. Advances on residential construction loans are made in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of construction. The terms of residential construction loans are made in accordance with Standard’s one- to four-family residential lending policy (described under “One- to Four-Family Residential Mortgage Loans”). At December 31, 2017, residential construction loans totaled $5.9 million and are included with one-to-four family residential and construction loans. At December 31, 2017, the additional un-advanced portion of these construction loans totaled $7.1 million. 
 Generally, before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, Standard requires an appraisal of the property by a state-certified or state-licensed appraiser. Standard reviews and inspects properties before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. Construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, Standard may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. In the event Standard makes a land acquisition loan on property that is not yet approved for the planned development, there is the risk that approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Construction loans also expose Standard to the risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated. 
 Loan Originations, Sales, Participations and Servicing.   All loans that Standard originates are underwritten pursuant to its policies and procedures, which incorporate standard underwriting and secondary market guidelines. Standard originates both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans. Standard’s loan origination and sales activity may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment that typically results in decreased loan demand. Most of Standard’s one- to four-family residential mortgage loan originations are generated by its loan officers. 
 During fiscal 2017 and 2016, Standard sold approximately 9.4% and 24%, respectively, of the longer term fixed rate loans to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (“FHLB”) through its Mortgage Partnership Finance (“MPF”) program that were originated during the year, with loan servicing rights retained. During the fiscal years 2017 and 2016, Standard originated $5.3 million and $3.9 million, respectively, of fixed-rate loans primarily with terms greater than 15 years which were sold to assist Standard in managing interest rate risk. Standard sells its loans with the servicing rights retained on residential mortgage loans, and Standard intends to continue this practice in the future, subject to the pricing of retaining such servicing rights. At December 31, 2017, Standard was servicing loans owned by others with a principal balance of $68.7 million. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent borrowers, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans. Standard retains a portion of the interest paid by the borrower on the loans it services as consideration for its servicing activities. 
 From time to time, Standard enters into participations in commercial loans with other banks. In these circumstances, Standard will generally follow its customary loan underwriting and approval policies. At December 31, 2017 Standard had $48.4 million in loan participations which included $2.2 million related to lease financing. 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority.   Standard’s lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by its Board of Directors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral that will secure the loan. To assess the borrower’s ability to repay, Standard reviews the borrower’s employment and credit history, and historical and projected income and expenses. Standard requires “full documentation” on all of its loan applications. Standard requires a full appraisal of all real property securing 1st lien residential mortgage loans. Standard also requires appraisals on home equity

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  loans and lines of credit and commercial real estate loans of $250,000 or greater. For loan amounts under $250,000 an appraisal may be required or other objective methods of property valuations are utilized. All appraisers are state-licensed or state-certified appraisers, and it’s Bank practice to have local appraisers approved by the Board of Directors annually. 
 Standard’s policies and loan approval limits are established by the Board of Directors. The approval authority necessary to decision all loan applications regardless of loan type is based on the resulting total exposure of the relationship. Secured loan requests with a relationship exposure of $3.0 million or less can be approved by designated individual officers, officers acting together with specific lending approval authority, and/or the Officer Loan Committee. Secured loan requests with a relationship exposure in excess of $3.0 million can be approved by the Board Loan Committee. Unsecured loan requests utilize a similar authority breakdown with the Board Loan Committee decisioning unsecured requests resulting in relationship exposures in excess of $750,000. The Board of Directors approves all loan requests subject to Regulation O, and those that result in a relationship exposure that exceeds the Bank’s internal House Limit. The Bank’s House Limit was $7.7 million at December 31, 2017. 
 Investments 
 Our Investment Committee, which is comprised of our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Director of Finance, has primary responsibility for implementing our investment policy, which is established by our Audit Committee. The general investment strategies are developed and authorized by the Investment Committee in consultation with our Audit Committee. The Investment Committee is responsible for the execution of specific investment actions. These officers are authorized to execute investment transactions without the Board of Directors prior approval (provided the transactions are within the scope of the established investment policy). The investment policy is reviewed annually by the Investment Committee, and any changes to the policy are subject to approval by the full Board of Directors. The overall objectives of the Investment Policy are to maintain a portfolio of high quality and diversified investments to maximize interest income over the long term and to minimize risk, to provide collateral for borrowings, to provide additional earnings when loan production is low, and, when appropriate, to reduce our tax liability. The policy dictates that investment decisions give consideration to the safety of principal, liquidity requirements and interest rate risk management. All securities transactions are reported to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. 
 Our current investment policy permits investments in securities issued by the U.S. Government as well as mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities, corporate bonds and direct obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. The investment policy also permits, with certain limitations, investments in certificates of deposit, collateralized mortgage obligations, mutual funds and equity securities. Our current investment policy does not permit investment in stripped mortgage-backed securities or derivatives as defined in federal banking regulations or in other high-risk securities. Our investment policy expressly prohibits the use of our investment portfolio for market-oriented trading activities or speculative purposes unless otherwise approved by our Audit Committee. We do not currently have a trading account for investment securities. 
 We designate a security as either held to maturity, available for sale, or trading, based upon our ability and intent. Securities available for sale and trading securities are reported at market value and securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost. A periodic review and evaluation of the available for sale and held to maturity securities portfolios is conducted to determine if the fair value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other-than-temporary. At December 31, 2017, all of our securities were classified as available for sale. Our securities portfolio at December 31, 2017 consisted primarily of securities with the following fair values: $67.6 million of mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. Government agencies and U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises; $50.8 million of municipal obligations; $8.3 million of U.S. government and agency obligations; $2.3 million of corporate bonds and $4.2 million of equity securities. At December 31, 2017, none of the collateral underlying our securities portfolio was considered subprime or Alt-A. See “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Balance Sheet Analysis: December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 — Investment Securities Portfolio” for a discussion of the recent performance of our securities portfolio.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as “pass-through” certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is “passed through” to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. Mortgage-backed securities typically are collateralized by pools of one- to four-family or multifamily (loans on properties with 5 or more units) mortgages, although we invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as Standard Bank. The interest rate on the security is lower than the interest rates on the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees. Ginnie Mae, a U.S. Government agency, and government sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, either guarantee the payments or guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest to investors. Mortgage-backed securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans since there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize borrowings. Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. Current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments. 
Sources of Funds 
 General.   Deposits traditionally have been our primary source of funds for our investment and lending activities. We also borrow from the FHLB to supplement cash flow needs. Our additional sources of funds are scheduled loan payments, maturing investments, loan repayments, customer repurchase agreements, income on other earning assets and the proceeds of loan sales. 
 Deposits.   We accept deposits primarily from the areas in which our offices are located. We rely on our competitive pricing and products, convenient locations and quality customer service to attract and retain deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposit accounts consist of savings accounts, certificates of deposit and regular checking accounts. Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market interest rates, liquidity requirements and our deposit growth goals. 
 Borrowings.   Our borrowings consist of short-term borrowings and long term advances from the FHLB as well as funds borrowed from customers under repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2017, FHLB short-term borrowings and long-term advances totaled $27.0 million, or 3.2%, and $107.7 million, or 12.8%, of total liabilities, respectively. Repurchase agreements totalled $4.2 million, or 0.5%, of total liabilities. At December 31, 2017, we had access to additional FHLB borrowings of up to $286.9 million. Short-term borrowings and long-term advances from the FHLB are collateralized by certain qualifying collateral such as loans, with weighted average collateral values determined by the FHLB equal to a least the unpaid amount of outstanding borrowings. Repurchase agreements are secured by municipal and U.S.  government obligations. 
Subsidiary Activities 
 Standard Bank has one active subsidiary, Westmoreland Investment Company, which is a Delaware corporation that holds residential mortgage loans originated and serviced by Standard Bank. 
 Expense and Tax Allocation 
 Standard Bank has entered into an agreement with Standard AVB Financial Corp. to provide it with certain administrative support services, whereby Standard Bank will be compensated at not less than the fair market value of the services provided. In addition, Standard Bank and Standard AVB Financial Corp. have entered into an agreement to establish a method for allocating and for reimbursing the payment of their consolidated tax liability. 
Personnel 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 144 full-time equivalent employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management believes that we have a good working relationship with our employees.

  SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 General 
 Standard Bank is supervised and examined by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities as the issuer of its charter, and by the FDIC as the insurer of its deposits and its primary federal regulator. Standard Bank also is regulated to a lesser extent by the Federal Reserve Board, governing reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters. Standard Bank is also subject to consumer protection rules and regulations issued by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. This system of state and federal regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund, depositors, and other customers, and not for the protection of security holders. Standard Bank is periodically examined by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC to ensure that it satisfies applicable standards with respect to its capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates. Following examinations, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC prepare reports for the consideration of Standard Bank’s Board of Directors on any operating deficiencies. Standard Bank’s relationship with its depositors also is regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a much lesser extent, state law, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of Standard Bank’s loan documents. 
 As a bank holding company, Standard AVB Financial Corp. is required to file certain reports with, is subject to examination by, and otherwise must comply with the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Reserve Board. 
 Any change in the applicable laws or regulations, whether by the FDIC, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the Federal Reserve Board or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on Standard AVB Financial Corp., Standard Bank and their operations. 
 Set forth below is a brief description of certain regulatory requirements that are applicable to Standard Bank and Standard AVB Financial Corp. The description below is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Standard Bank and Standard AVB Financial Corp. 
 Dodd-Frank Act 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and is affecting the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — The Dodd-Frank Act may have a material impact on our operations and the cost of our operations.” Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act had delayed effective dates and the legislation required various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations over a period of years. Although the effect of all of these regulations cannot be completely determined at this time, it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations will increase our operating and compliance costs. 
 Banking Regulation 
 Pennsylvania Savings Bank Law.   The Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as amended (the “Banking Code”), contains detailed provisions governing the organization, operations, corporate powers, savings and investment authority, branching rights and responsibilities of directors, officers and employees of Pennsylvania savings banks. A Pennsylvania savings bank may locate or change the location of its principal place of business and establish an office anywhere in, or adjacent to, Pennsylvania, with the prior approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. The Banking Code delegates extensive rulemaking power and administrative discretion to the Department of Banking in its supervision and regulation of state-chartered savings banks. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any trustee, officer, attorney, or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities why such person should not be removed. The Department of Banking may also appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution in appropriate cases. 
 Capital Requirements.   Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015, and are the result of a final rule implementing recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally is defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital generally is defined as common equity Tier 1 plus additional Tier 1 capital, such as certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and certain other items. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions when deemed necessary. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. In calendar 2017, the capital conservation buffer was 1.25%. It increased to 1.875% on January 1, 2018. 
 Standard Bank is also subject to capital guidelines of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities requires 4% leverage capital and incorporates the federal risk-based requirements. The components of capital are substantially the same as those defined by the FDIC. 
 Prompt Corrective Action.   Under federal regulations, a bank is considered to be (i) “well capitalized” if it has total risk-based capital of 10.0% or more, Tier 1 risk-based capital of 8.0% or more, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital of 6.5% or more and Tier 1 leverage capital of 5.0% or more and is not subject to any written capital order or directive; (ii) “adequately capitalized” if it has total risk-based capital of 8.0% or more, Tier 1 risk-based capital of 6.0% or more, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital of 4.5% or more and Tier 1 leverage capital of 4.0% or more and does not meet the definition of “well capitalized”; (iii) “undercapitalized” if it has total risk-based capital of less than 8.0%, Tier 1 risk-based capital of less than 6.0%, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital of 4.5% or less or Tier 1 leverage capital of less than 4.0%; (iv) “significantly undercapitalized” if it has total risk-based capital of less than 6.0%, Tier 1 risk-based capital less than 4.0% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital of less than 3.0, or Tier 1 leverage capital of less than 3.0%; and (v) “critically undercapitalized” if its ratio of tangible equity to total assets is equal to or less than 2.0%. Federal regulations also specify circumstances under which a federal banking agency may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized, and may require an adequately capitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the FDIC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized). As of December 31, 2017, Standard Bank was “well-capitalized” for this purpose and exceeded all applicable capital requirements. The previously referenced final rule that increased regulatory capital requirements revised the prompt corrective action categories accordingly.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Federal law provides for certain supervisory measures for undercapitalized institutions including restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth and the requirement that a capital restoration plan be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date an institution receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” The criteria for an acceptable capital restoration plan include, among other things, the establishment of the methodology and assumptions for attaining adequately capitalized status on an annual basis, procedures for ensuring compliance with restrictions imposed by applicable federal regulations, the identification of the types and levels of activities the institution will engage in while the capital restoration plan is in effect, and assurances that the capital restoration plan will not appreciably increase the current risk profile of the institution. Any holding company for an institution required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of an amount equal to 5% of the institution’s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the FDIC or the amount necessary to restore the institution to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the FDIC notifies the institution that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters, and the FDIC has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee. The FDIC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. Generally, the FDIC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. 
 Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitation.   Under applicable regulations, with certain limited exceptions, a Pennsylvania chartered savings bank may lend to a single or related group of borrowers on an “unsecured” basis an amount equal to 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if such loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which is defined to include certain financial instruments and bullion, but generally does not include real estate. As a prudent lending practice, however, management and the Board of Directors have established an internal limitation for approval purposes based on the total exposure of a relationship. The formula to determine the Bank’s internal limitation is Tangible Capital times 15% times 50%. This limitation is a rolling number based on Bank performance, and is measured at the end of each calendar quarter. The internal limitation as of December 31, 2017 is $7.9 million. Any new loan request that results in an exposure for approval purposes that exceeds this limitation must be presented to the full Board of Directors for decisioning. 
 Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks.   Federal law generally limits the types and amounts of equity investments of state-chartered banks insured by the FDIC to those that are permissible for national banks. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things: (i) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary that is engaged in permissible activities; (ii) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank’s total assets; (iii) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures liability insurance for directors, trustees or officers, or blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions; and (iv) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met. The direct or indirect activities of a state bank are similarly generally limited to those of a national bank. Exceptions include where approval is received for the activity from the FDIC. 
 Capital Distributions. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, a depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying a dividend if the regulators deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice. Standard Bank is also subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment and amounts of dividends under the Banking Code. The Banking Code states, in part, that dividends may be declared and paid by Standard Bank only out of accumulated net earnings.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.   Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”), the FDIC is required to assess the record of all financial institutions regulated by it to determine if such institutions are meeting the credit needs of the community (including low-and moderate-income areas) which they serve. CRA performance evaluations are based on a four-tiered rating system: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve and Substantial Noncompliance. CRA performance evaluations are considered in evaluating applications for such things as mergers, acquisitions and applications to open branches. Standard Bank has a current CRA rating of “Satisfactory.” 
 Transactions with Related Parties.   Transactions between banks and their related parties or affiliates are limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank. 
 Generally, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (i) limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus, and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus and (ii) require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to non-affiliates. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of a loan to, purchase of assets from, issuance of a guarantee on behalf of and similar transactions with an affiliate. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the institution to the affiliate must be collateralized in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by a company to its executive officers and directors. However, the law contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws, assuming such loans are also permitted under the law of the institution’s chartering state. Under such laws, the Standard Bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders (“insiders”), as well as entities under such person’s control, is limited. The law limits both the individual and aggregate amount of loans Standard Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on the Standard Bank’s capital position and requires certain board of directors, approval procedures to be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executive officers are further limited to specific categories. 
 Standards for Safety and Soundness.   Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action. 
 Insurance of Deposit Accounts.   Standard Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts in Standard Bank are insured by the FDIC up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor. 
 The FDIC assesses insured depository institutions to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions with less than $10 billion of assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of an institution’s failure within three years. That system, effective July 1, 2016, replaced the previous system under which institutions were placed into risk categories.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund’s reserve ratio achieving 1.15%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for insured institutions of less than $10 billion of total assets to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points, effective July 1, 2016. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act requires insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more to fund the increase from 1.15% to 1.35% and, effective July 1, 2016, such institutions are subject to a surcharge to achieve that goal. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC, and the FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-range fund ratio of 2%. 
 The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of by Standard Bank. Future insurance assessments cannot be predicted. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
 In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the annualized FICO assessment rate equaled 0.54 basis points of total assets less tangible capital. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature by 2019. 
 Enforcement.   The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured state savings banks, including Standard Bank. The enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and capital directives and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System.   Standard Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, Standard Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2017, Standard Bank was in compliance with this requirement. 
Other Regulations 
 Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Standard Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Standard Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions. 
Bank Holding Company Regulation 
 As a bank holding company, Standard AVB Financial Corp. is subject to regulation and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Reserve Board. Standard AVB Financial Corp. is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board an annual report and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). The BHC Act requires each bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire substantially all the assets of any bank, or 

 13

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  before it may acquire ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than five percent of the voting shares of such bank. Such a transaction may also require approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. 
 Pursuant to provisions of the BHC Act and regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board thereunder, Standard AVB Financial Corp. may only engage in or own companies that engage in activities deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto, and the holding company must obtain permission from the Federal Reserve Board prior to engaging in most new business activities. A bank holding company that meets certain criteria may become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in a broader range of financial activities, including insurance underwriting and investment banking. Standard AVB Financial Corp. has not elected to become a financial holding company. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has adopted consolidated capital requirements for bank holding companies with assets of $1 billion or greater. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to revise its holding company consolidated capital requirements so that they are no less stringent than those applicable to insured depository institutions. The previously referenced regulatory capital requirements applicable to banks also apply to bank holding companies with assets of $1 billion or more. Such capital requirements would apply to Standard AVB Financial Corp. at such time as its size met that threshold. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board’s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board’s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. Federal Reserve Board policies require a bank holding company to consult with the agency prior to paying dividends or repurchasing its stock under certain circumstances. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory requirements and policies could affect the ability of Standard AVB Financial Corp. to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 Change in Control Regulations.   Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal regulations, means ownership, control of or holding more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances, including where the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control of a bank holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Any company that acquires such control becomes a “bank holding company” subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. 
Federal Securities Laws 
 Standard AVB Financial Corp.’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Standard AVB Financial Corp. is subject to the information and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Standard AVB Financial Corp. common stock held by persons who are affiliates (generally officers, directors and principal stockholders) of Standard AVB Financial Corp. may not be resold without registration or unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. If Standard AVB Financial Corp. meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of Standard AVB Financial Corp. is able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. 
 TAXATION 
 Federal Taxation 
 General.   Standard AVB Financial Corp. and Standard Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Standard AVB Financial Corp. and Standard Bank. 
 Method of Accounting.   For federal income tax purposes, Standard Bank will file a consolidated tax return with Standard AVB Financial Corp. and will report its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and use a calendar year ending December 31st for filing their consolidated federal income tax returns. 
 Minimum Tax.   The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, referred to as “alternative minimum taxable income.” The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount. Net operating losses can, in general, offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. At December 31, 2017, Standard AVB Financial Corp. had no alternative minimum tax credit carryforward. 
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers.   Generally, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At December 31, 2017, we had no net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes. 
 Corporate Dividends.   Standard AVB Financial Corp. will be able to exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from Standard Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. 
 Audit of Tax Returns.   Our 2010 federal income tax return was audited by the Internal Revenue Service in 2012 with no changes to the return as filed. The 2014 federal tax return was audited in 2016 with no changes to the return as filed. 
State Taxation 
 The Bank is subject to the Pennsylvania and Maryland Thrift Institutions tax which is allocated between the states and calculated at 11.5% and 8.25%, respectively, based on taxable income applicable to the individual states. Our state income tax returns, as applicable, have not been audited in the most recent
