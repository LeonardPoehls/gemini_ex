ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
Company Overview
Anixter International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as "Anixter" or the "Company") and sometimes referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as "we", "our", "us", or "ourselves", founded in 1957, is headquartered near Chicago, Illinois and trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AXE. The Company was formerly known as Itel Corporation which was incorporated under Delaware law in 1967. Through Anixter Inc. and its subsidiaries, we are a leading distributor of network and security solutions, electrical and electronic solutions, and utility power solutions.
Through our global presence, technical expertise and supply chain solutions, we help our customers reduce the risk, cost and complexity of their supply chains. We add value to the distribution process by providing over 150,000 customers access to innovative inventory management programs, nearly 600,000 products and over $1.0 billion in inventory, 320 warehouses/branch locations with approximately 9 million square feet of space, and locations in over 300 cities across approximately 50 countries. We are a leader in the provision of advanced inventory management services including procurement, just-in-time delivery, quality assurance testing, advisory engineering services, component kit production, small component assembly and e-commerce and electronic data interchange to a broad spectrum of customers. 
Our customers are international, national, regional and local companies, covering a broad and diverse set of industry groups including manufacturing, resource extraction, telecommunications, internet service providers, finance, education, healthcare, retail, transportation, utilities (both public power and investor owned), defense and government; and include contractors, installers, system integrators, value-added resellers, architects, engineers and wholesale distributors. Our customer base is well-diversified with no single customer accounting for more than 2% of sales.
Our differentiated operating model is premised on our belief that our customers and suppliers value a partner with consistent global product offerings, technical expertise (including product and application knowledge and support) and customized supply chain solutions, all supported by a common operating system and business practices that ensure the same "look, touch and feel" worldwide.
Our growth strategy is driven by constant refresh and expansion of our product and solution offerings to meet marketplace needs. This organic growth approach extends to a constantly evolving set of supply chain services that are designed to lower the customer’s total cost of procuring, owning and deploying the products we sell. We have identified security solutions, emerging markets, utilities, industrial communications and control and in-building wireless as growth opportunities we are pursuing. Organic growth will periodically be supplemented with acquisitions where the benefits associated with geographic expansion, market penetration or new product line additions are weighted in favor of "buying versus building."
In the third quarter of 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Tri-Northern Acquisition Holdings, Inc. ("Tri-Ed"), a leading independent distributor of security and low-voltage technology products headquartered in Woodbury, NY. The acquisition of Tri-Ed offers a strategic opportunity for us and our security business, consistent with our vision to create a leading global security platform. Through expanding our offering into highly complementary products lines, our customers benefit from a broader set of products and solutions in the areas of video, access control, fire/life safety, and intrusion detection. In addition, this transaction provides access to the residential construction end-market and a community of security integrators and dealers we did not historically service. For further information regarding Tri-Ed, refer to Note 3. "Business Combinations" in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
During the second quarter of 2015, we completed the sale of the OEM Supply - Fasteners ("Fasteners") business to American Industrial Partners ("AIP"), excluding certain foreign locations which were subsequently sold. This transaction sharpened our focus on our then core Enterprise Cabling and Security Solutions ("ECS") and Electrical and Electronic Wire and Cable ("W&C") segments and provided additional financial flexibility to build on these strong global platforms. For further information regarding the sale of our Fasteners business, refer to Note 2. "Discontinued Operations" in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed the acquisition of the Power Solutions business ("Power Solutions") from HD Supply, Inc. Power Solutions represents the largest acquisition in Anixter's history and transforms Anixter into a leading North American distributor to the utility sector, enhances our competitive position in the electrical wire and cable markets and further strengthens our overall customer and supplier value proposition. For further information regarding Power Solutions, refer to Note 3. "Business Combinations" in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business Segments and Products
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012 and through the first quarter of 2015, the Company's operating and reportable segments were ECS, W&C, and Fasteners. Following the sale of the Fasteners business in the second quarter of 2015, our remaining operating segments were ECS and W&C. In the fourth quarter of 2015, in connection with the acquisition of Power Solutions, we renamed our legacy ECS segment to Network & Security Solutions ("NSS"). The low voltage business of Power Solutions was combined into our legacy W&C segment to form the Electrical & Electronic Solutions ("EES") segment. The high voltage business of Power Solutions formed our Utility Power Solutions ("UPS") segment. The following is a brief description of each of our reportable segments and business activities.
Within our segments, we are also organized by geographies. Our geographies consist of North America, which includes the U.S. and Canada, EMEA, which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Emerging Markets, which includes Asia Pacific and Central and Latin America ("CALA").
Network & Security Solutions ("NSS")
The Network & Security Solutions segment, with operations in approximately 46 countries, supplies products and customized Supply Chain Solutions to customers in a diverse range of industries including technology, finance, telecommunications service providers, transportation, education, government, healthcare and retail. NSS provides solutions to end-users and sells the products through various channels including data communications contractors, security, network and systems integrators, and directly to end users. NSS has a broad product portfolio that includes copper and fiber optic cable and connectivity, access control, video surveillance, intrusion and fire/life safety, cabinets, power, cable management, wireless, professional audio/video, voice and networking switches and other ancillary products. The NSS segment includes more than 2,100 technically trained salespeople, approximately 40 Supply Chain Solutions specialists and a global technical support organization that provides support across all three reportable segments to aid in design, product specification and complete bills of materials inclusive of all Anixter solutions.
Through a variety of value-added supply chain solutions, including inventory management, product packaging and enhancement, financial and other customized supply chain services, NSS helps customers reduce the risk, complexity and cost associated with their IT infrastructure and physical security deployments. The NSS commitment to quality products and services and technical leadership is demonstrated by its participation in many global standards organizations. NSS technical expertise extends to performance and interoperability testing at our Infrastructure Solutions LabSM, which provides NSS the opportunity to demonstrate solutions and proof-of-concepts to customers. Anixter's Infrastructure as a Platform and ipAssuredSM programs help customers make intelligent buying decisions around network and security infrastructure and improve efficiency to meet their sustainability goals.
Electrical & Electronic Solutions ("EES")
The Electrical & Electronic Solutions segment, with operations in over 30 countries, supplies a broad range of wire and cable, control, power/gear, lighting and electrical bulk products and customized supply chain solutions to the Commercial and Industrial ("C&I") and Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM") markets. The C&I group supplies products for the transmission of power and signals in industrial applications to customers in key markets including oil, gas and petrochemical, alternative energy, utility, power generation and distribution, transportation, commercial, industrial, natural resource and water and wastewater treatment. It sells through channels including electrical contractors, security and automation integrators, and engineering, procurement and construction firms. The OEM group supplies products used in the manufacturing of automotive, industrial, medical, transportation, marine, military and communications equipment, selling to OEM and panel, cable and harness shops. The product portfolio in this global business includes electrical and electronic wire and cable, shipboard cable, support and supply products, low-voltage cable, instrumentation cable, industrial communication and control products, security cable, connectors, industrial Ethernet switches, and voice and data cable. Value-added services, including supply chain management services and engineering support are tailored to position us as a specialist in fast growing emerging markets, OEMs and industrial verticals. EES helps customers achieve their sustainability goals by using its value-added services to minimize scrap, reduce lead times and improve operational efficiency.
The EES team of more than 1,100 technical experts includes its sales personnel, supply chain specialists, industrial communication specialists and engineers. EES provides world-class technical assistance, products and support through code and standards interpretation, product selection assistance, on-site customer training and customer specification reviews. EES brings value to its customers through its global reach, ability to provide global infrastructure project coordination, technical and engineering support, financial strength, and sourcing and supplier relationships. These capabilities help customers reduce costs and risks and gain competitive advantage in their marketplace.

Utility Power Solutions ("UPS")
The Utility Power Solutions segment, with primary operations in the U.S. and Canada, supplies electrical transmission and distribution products, power plant maintenance, repair and operations supplies and smart-grid products, and arranges materials management and procurement outsourcing for the power generation and electricity distribution industries. The UPS segment serves the utilities (both public power and investor owned) and electrical markets. It serves electric power plant customers primarily through a bid-based model and, to a lesser extent, sells maintenance, repair and operations products through an e-commerce platform. Products include conductors such as wire and cable, transformers, overhead transmission and distribution hardware, switches, protective devices and underground distribution, connectors used in the construction or maintenance and repair of electricity transmission and substation distribution infrastructure, and supplies, lighting and conduit used in non-residential and residential construction. UPS also provides materials management and procurement outsourcing services. Its capabilities allow us to integrate with our customers and perform part of our customers' sourcing and procurement function. The UPS segment includes more than 300 technically trained salespeople and nearly 60 Supply Chain Solutions specialists.
For more information concerning our business segments, foreign and domestic operations and export sales, see Note 8. "Income Taxes" and Note 11. "Business Segments" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Suppliers
We source products from thousands of suppliers, with approximately one-quarter of our annual dollar volume purchases sourced from our five largest suppliers. An important element of our overall business strategy is to develop and maintain close relationships with our key suppliers, which include the world’s leading manufacturers of communication cabling, connectivity, support and supply products, electrical wire and cable, and utility products. Such relationships emphasize joint product planning, inventory management, technical support, advertising and marketing. In support of this strategy, we generally do not compete with our suppliers in product design or manufacturing activities. We do sell a small amount of private label products that carry a brand name exclusive to us.
Our typical distribution agreement generally includes the following significant terms:


• | a non-exclusive right to resell products to any customer in a geographical area (typically defined as a country, with the exception of our UPS business which is typically defined as a county);


• | cancelable upon 60 to 90 days notice by either party for any reason;


• | no minimum purchase requirements, although pricing may change with volume on a prospective basis; and


• | the right to pass through the manufacturer’s warranty to our customers.

Distribution and Service Platform 
We cost-effectively serve our customers’ needs through our proprietary computer systems, which connect the majority of our warehouses and sales offices throughout the world. The systems are designed for sales support, order entry, inventory status, order tracking, credit review and material management. Customers may also conduct business through our e-commerce platform, which we believe is one of the most comprehensive and user-friendly websites in the industry.
We operate a series of large, modern, regional distribution centers in key geographic locations in North America, EMEA and Emerging Markets that provide for cost-effective, reliable storage and delivery of products to our customers. We have designated 17 warehouses as regional distribution centers. Collectively, these facilities store approximately 30% of our inventory. In certain cities, some smaller warehouses are also maintained to maximize transportation efficiency and to provide for the local needs of customers. Our network of regional distribution centers, local distribution centers, service centers, branch locations and sales offices consists of 264 locations in the United States, 33 in Canada, 25 in the United Kingdom, 25 in Continental Europe and the Middle East, 34 in Latin America, 11 in Asia and 6 in Australia/New Zealand. 
We have developed close relationships with certain freight, package delivery and courier services to minimize transit times between our facilities and customer locations, as well as a dedicated delivery fleet of over 500 vehicles with the Power Solutions acquisition. The combination of our information systems, distribution network and delivery partnerships allows us to provide a high level of customer service while maintaining a reasonable level of investment in inventory and facilities.
Employees
At December 30, 2016, we employed over 8,900 people. Approximately 50% of the employees are engaged in sales or sales-related activities, 30% are engaged in warehousing and distribution operations and 20% are engaged in support activities, including inventory management, information services, finance, human resources and general management. We do not have any significant concentrations of employees subject to collective bargaining agreements within any of our segments.

Competition
Given our role as an aggregator of many different types of products from many different sources and because these products are sold to many different industry groups, there is no well-defined industry group against which we compete. We view the competitive environment as highly fragmented with hundreds of distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly or through multiple distribution channels to end users or other resellers. There is significant competition within each end market and geography served that creates pricing pressure and the need for constant attention to improve services. Competition is based primarily on breadth of products, quality, services, relationships, price and geographic proximity. We believe that we have a significant competitive advantage due to our comprehensive product and service offerings, global distribution network, technically-trained sales team and customized supply chain solutions. We believe our global distribution platform provides a competitive advantage to serving multinational customers’ needs. Our operations and logistics platform gives us the ability to ship orders from inventory for delivery within 24 to 48 hours to all major global markets. In addition, we have common systems and processes throughout the majority of our operations in approximately 50 countries that provide our customers and suppliers with global consistency.
We enhance our value proposition to both key suppliers and customers through our technical expertise, global standards participation testing and demonstration facilities and numerous quality assurance certification programs such as ISO 9001:2008 and ISO/TS 16949:2009. Our NSS and EES segments leverage our certified Infrastructure Solutions Lab located at our suburban Chicago headquarters to support customers with technology needs related to enterprise networks, data centers, physical security, building technologies and industrial communications and control. At this lab, we evaluate performance and interoperability to help customers reduce risk through informed purchasing decisions. Our Solutions Briefing Centers, premier technology education and demonstration facilities located in various regions around the globe, focus on enabling our customers with the necessary information to make informed decisions around complex, end-to-end technology solutions. 
Because privately held companies account for a significant share of our markets, reliable competitive information is not available. 
Contract Sales and Backlog
We have a number of customers who purchase products under long-term contractual arrangements. In such circumstances, the relationship with the customer typically involves a high degree of material requirements planning and information systems interfaces and, in some cases, may require the maintenance of a dedicated distribution facility or dedicated personnel and inventory at, or in close proximity to, the customer site to meet the needs of the customer. Such contracts do not generally require the customer to purchase any minimum amount of goods from us, but would require that materials acquired by us, as a result of joint material requirements planning between us and the customer, be purchased by the customer. Backlog orders, excluding large contractual orders, represent approximately four weeks of sales and ship to customers within 30 to 60 days from order date. 
Seasonality
The operating results are not significantly affected by seasonal fluctuations except for the impact resulting from variations in the number of billing days from quarter to quarter. Consecutive quarter sales from the third to fourth quarters are generally lower due to the holidays and lower number of billing days as compared to other consecutive quarter comparisons. There were 254 billing days in 2016 and 253 billing days in both 2015 and 2014.
