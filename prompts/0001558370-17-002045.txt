The Company’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ stock market under the symbol “HONE”. 
     Market Area and Competition
    
The Company provides financial services to individuals, families, small to middle-market businesses and municipalities throughout Southeastern New England. While our primary deposit-gathering area is concentrated within our branch office communities located in the Massachusetts counties of Norfolk, Bristol and Plymouth, our lending area encompasses the broader market of Eastern Massachusetts, the greater Providence, Rhode Island metropolitan area and through our subsidiary Merrimack Mortgage, New Hampshire and southern Maine.
    
The Company faces significant competition both in attracting deposits and generating loans. Our primary competitors are savings banks, commercial and co-operative banks, credit unions, internet banks, as well as, other nonbank institutions that offer financial alternatives such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. 
    
Our competition for loans comes from savings banks, commercial and co-operative banks, credit unions, internet banks and from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies, mortgage brokers and the finance arms of auto makers. Competition for loans also comes from non-depository financial service companies entering the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies and specialty finance companies. 
    
Many of the banks that operate in our primary market area are owned by large national and regional holding companies, are larger than we are and therefore may have greater resources or offer a broader range of products and services. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks and other financial services companies to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet, and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Increased competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our growth in the future. 
     Lending Activities
    
One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Loans.    We provide residential real estate loans for home purchase or refinancing on existing homes, most of which serve as the primary residence of the owner. At December 31, 2016, residential mortgage

loans were $677.9 million, or 34.1% of total loans, and consisted of $607.4 million and $70.5 million of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, respectively. We offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans with terms up to 30 years
    
Our one- to four-family residential mortgage originations are generally underwritten to conform to Federal National Mortgage Association, or "Fannie Mae," and Federal National Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or "Freddie Mac," underwriting guidelines. Our adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally adjust annually or after an initial fixed period that ranges from three to seven years and are adjusted to a rate equal to a specified percentage above the LIBOR or U.S. Treasury index. Depending on the loan type, the maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 2.0% per adjustment period with the lifetime interest rate caps ranging from 5.0% to 6.0% over the initial interest rate of the loan. 
    
Borrower demand for adjustable-rate compared to fixed-rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, and the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans as compared to the interest rates and loan fees for adjustable-rate loans. The relative amount of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment. The loan fees, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us on the basis of our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions. 
    
While residential mortgage loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full either upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans. 
    
We originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 80.0% and we generally require private mortgage insurance for residential loans secured by a first mortgage with a loan-to-value ratio over 80.0%. We generally require all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by a licensed real estate appraiser. We generally require title insurance on all first mortgage loans. Exceptions to these lending policies are based on an evaluation of credit risk related to the borrower and the size of the loan. Borrowers must obtain hazard insurance, and flood insurance is required for loans on properties located in a flood zone. 
    
In an effort to provide financing for first-time buyers, we offer adjustable- and fixed-rate loans to qualified individuals and originate the loans using modified underwriting guidelines, reduced interest rates and loan conditions and reduced closing costs. We also participate in publicly sponsored loan programs which provide competitive terms for low and moderate income home buyers.
    
The majority of the conforming fixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans we originate are sold to the secondary market mainly to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with servicing retained other than for specialized governmental programs that require servicing to be released.  Generally, we hold in our portfolio nonconforming loans, shorter-term fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans. 
    
We generally do not (i) originate "interest only" mortgage loans on one- to four-family residential properties, (ii) offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal such as "option ARM" loans where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on their loan, (iii) offer "subprime" loans (loans that are made with low down payments to borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity) or (iv) offer "Alt-A" loans (loans to borrowers having less than full documentation). 
    
Second Mortgages and Equity Lines of Credit.    We offer second mortgages and equity lines of credit, which are secured by owner-occupied residences. At December 31, 2016, second mortgages and equity lines of credit were $93.0 million, or 4.7% of total loans. Second mortgages are made at fixed interest rates and terms of up to fifteen years. Equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest that are indexed to the Prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal plus or minus a margin, and generally are subject to an interest rate floor, with 10-year draws and repayment terms of between five and twenty years. We offer second mortgages and equity lines of credit with cumulative loan-to-value ratios generally up to 80.0%, when taking into account both the balance of the home equity loan and first mortgage loan. We hold a first mortgage position on the homes that secure second mortgages or equity lines of credit in approximately one-third of the portfolio. 
    
The procedures for underwriting home equity lines of credit include an assessment of the applicant's payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicant's creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral to the proposed loan amount. The procedures for underwriting residential mortgage loans apply equally to second mortgages and equity lines of credit.

Commercial Real Estate Loans.   Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by properties used for business purposes such as office buildings, retail development, manufacturing facilities, warehouse distribution, hospitality and apartment buildings. We currently focus our commercial real estate efforts on small- and mid-size owner occupants and investors in our market area seeking loans between $350,000 and $20 million. At December 31, 2016, commercial real estate loans were $495.8 million, or 24.9% of total loans, and consisted of $215.4 million of fixed-rate loans and $280.4 million of adjustable rate loans. 
    
We originate fixed- and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans typically with terms of five to ten years but loans may be for terms of up to 20 years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans typically adjust in accordance with a designated index every three, five or seven years. Most of our adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans adjust every five years to a specified percentage above the corresponding FHLB Classic Advance borrowing rate and amortize over a 25-year term. We also offer interest rate swaps to accommodate customer needs. Loan amounts generally do not exceed 80.0% of the property's appraised value at the time the loan is originated. 
    
We consider a number of factors when underwriting commercial real estate loans that include projected net cash flow to the loan’s debt service requirement, the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the sponsor and their experience in owning or managing similar properties. When circumstances warrant, personal guarantees are obtained from the principals of the borrower on commercial real estate.
    
 In addition to originating these loans, we participate in commercial real estate loans with other financial institutions located primarily in Massachusetts and sell participation interests in commercial real estate loans to local financial institutions, primarily the portion of loans that exceed our borrowing limits or are in an amount that is considered prudent to manage our credit risk, see Participation Loans below.
    
At December 31, 2016, the average loan size of our outstanding commercial real estate loans was $2.7 million, and our four largest credits ranged from $12.0 million to $14.5 million. These loans were performing in accordance with their original terms at December 31, 2016. Our largest commercial real estate relationship totaled $24.3 million and financed two retail shopping centers and industrial warehouse space.
    
Commercial Loans.  We originate commercial loans and lines of credit to a variety of professionals, sole proprietorships and small- to medium-sized businesses, primarily in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, with sales up to $50 million and borrowing needs up to $10 million, for working capital and other business purposes. At December 31, 2016, commercial loans were $100.5 million, or 5.1% of total loans and consisted of $33.5 million of fixed-rate loans and $67.0 million of adjustable rate loans.
    
Commercial loans are made with either variable or fixed rates of interest. Variable rates are based on a margin over the LIBOR index or the Prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin. Fixed-rate business loans are generally indexed to a corresponding FHLB rate, plus a margin. Commercial loans typically have shorter maturity terms and higher interest spreads than real estate loans, but generally involve more credit risk because of the type and nature of the collateral. We generally require that our commercial customers maintain a deposit relationship with the Bank. 
    
When making commercial loans, we consider the financial statements and the experience of the borrower, our lending history with the borrower, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business and the value of the collateral, primarily accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Commercial loan amounts are determined based on the capacity for debt service and an evaluation of the age, condition and collectability of the collateral but generally, advance rates for certain asset classes would not exceed 80%.  To monitor cash flows on income properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, where applicable, to provide annual financial statements on commercial real estate loans.  In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial real estate loan, we consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise, credit history, profitability and the value of the underlying property.  We generally require an independent appraisal or valuation, an environmental survey and a property condition report for commercial real estate loans.
    
At December 31, 2016, the average loan size of our outstanding commercial loans was $204,000 and our four largest commercial loan exposures were $2.4 million to $5.5 million. These loans are secured by all business assets of the borrower and were performing according to its original terms at December 31, 2016. 
    
Construction Loans.    We originate commercial construction loans for commercial development projects, including industrial buildings, retail and office buildings and speculative residential real estate. We also originate residential real estate construction loans

to professional developers, contractors and builders, and to a lesser extent, individuals, to finance the construction of residential dwellings. At December 31, 2016, construction loan balances were $58.4 million, or 2.9% of total loans. Commercial construction balances were $43.5 million and homeowner construction balances were $14.9 million. At December 31, 2016, our commercial construction loan portfolio consisted of $8.2 million in loan balances that were secured by speculative residential real estate loan projects, $22.6 million in loans that were secured by commercial real estate speculative projects and $12.7 million secured by owner occupied commercial real estate projects. As of December 31, 2016 unadvanced funds on total construction loans was $50.0 million, $43.6 million for commercial real estate construction and $6.4 million on residential real estate construction loans.
    
Our commercial construction loans generally call for the payment of interest only with interest rates tied to LIBOR or Prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin. Construction loans for commercial real estate can be originated with principal balances of up to $20.0 million, but generally are lower; the average originated principal at December 31, 2016 was $4.9 million.  Advances on commercial construction loans are made in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of construction and repayment is generally expected from permanent financing upon completion of construction.
    
Our residential real estate construction loans generally are fixed-rate loans that provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is usually 12-36 months. At the end of the construction phase, the loan may be paid in full or converted to a permanent mortgage loan. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we generally require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. Our loan policy dictates a minimum equity contribution by the borrower of 20.0% and loan-to-value ratio not greater than 80.0% of the appraised market value estimated upon completion of the project. All borrowers are underwritten and evaluated for creditworthiness based on past experience, debt service ability, net worth analysis including available liquidity, and other credit factors. Advances are only made following an inspection of the property confirming completion of the required progress on the project and an update to the title completed by a bank approved attorney. 
    
At December 31, 2016, our largest outstanding commercial construction loan relationship was $20.0 million. This project is secured by a first mortgage on speculative commercial real estate to develop a hotel. This loan is pending participation out 40% of the principal balance and was performing according to its original repayment terms at December 31, 2016.
    
Auto and Other Consumer Loans.   We primarily focus on the origination of auto loans through indirect loans and lease assignments (“leases”) from Credit Union Leasing of America, or "CULA." At December 31, 2016, auto loans and leases were $547.4 million, or 27.5% of total loans and 97.2% of consumer loans. At December 31, 2016, the auto loan portfolio consisted of auto loans of $251.9 million and leases of $295.5 million. Other consumer loans, consisting primarily of unsecured lines of credit and personal loans, were $15.7 million, or 0.8% of total loans. 
    
We originate auto loans and leases through a network of approximately 275 auto dealers secured by new and used vehicles primarily in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Our primary considerations when originating these loans and leases are the borrower's ability to pay and the value of the underlying collateral. An indirect auto loan or lease is originated when the borrower purchases or leases a motor vehicle at an auto dealership and elects to finance a portion of that purchase or lease. The Bank is assigned leases through an agreement with CULA. At the origination of the lease, the car dealership sells the lease and related vehicle to CULA. CULA simultaneously assigns the lease and grants a security interest in the vehicle to the Bank. 
    
Leases generally have a higher rate of return than indirect auto loans because interest rates on leases are higher and the leases tend to last for their full term. Lease terms vary between 12 and 60 months, but typically average 36 to 39 months in duration. Due to these advantages, the Bank has concentrated its recent origination efforts in leases, and expects to continue to do so depending on market conditions. 
    
The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include an assessment of the applicant's payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicant's creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount. 
      Loan Underwriting Risks. 
    
Residential Real Estate Loans.    Due to historically low interest rate levels, borrowers generally have preferred fixed-rate loans in recent years. While we anticipate that our adjustable-rate loans will better offset the adverse effects on our net interest income of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate loans, the increased mortgage payments required of adjustable-rate loans in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. If we are forced to foreclose on a residential property due to default, the marketability of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment, 

 
  7

 

and we may not be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs.  In addition, although adjustable-rate loans help make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits. 
    
Commercial Real Estate Loans.    Loans secured by commercial real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in commercial real estate lending is the borrower's creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy to a greater extent than residential real estate loans. If we are forced to foreclose on a commercial real estate property due to default, we may not be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs.
    
Commercial Loans.    Commercial loans also involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial loans are typically made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flows of the borrower's business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. 
    
Consumer Loans.    Consumer loans entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections depend on the borrower's continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. 
    
Construction Loans.    Construction financing is considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property's value at completion of construction or development and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the development. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or before the maturity of the loan, with a project having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. As a result of the foregoing, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If we are forced to foreclose on a project before or at completion due to a default, we may not be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. 
    
Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales.    Loan originations come from a number of sources. The primary source of loan originations are our in-house loan originators, and to a lesser extent, local mortgage brokers and third party originators of residential loans, advertising and referrals from customers. We occasionally purchase commercial business loans or participation interests in commercial real estate loans. 
    
Additionally, our current practice is generally (1) to sell to the secondary market newly originated 30-year or longer term conforming fixed-rate residential mortgage loans and all loans originated by our mortgage banking subsidiary and (2) to hold in our portfolio nonconforming loans, shorter-term fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans. Our decision to sell loans is based on prevailing market interest rate conditions and interest rate risk management. Loans are sold to third parties with servicing either retained or released. In addition, we sell participation interests in commercial real estate loans to local financial institutions, primarily the portion of loans that exceed our borrowing limits or are in an amount that is considered prudent to manage our credit risk. 
    
For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we originated loans of $2.21 billion and $1.17 billion of loans, respectively. During the same periods, we sold $1.50 billion and $707.8 million of loans, respectively. 
    
Loan Participations.    We cultivate relationships with other financial institutions to mitigate the risk of our lending activities by participating either as the lead bank or as a participant in various loan transactions. We purchase participation interests in larger balance loans from other financial institutions generally in our market area. Such participations are reviewed for compliance, are 

 
  8

 

underwritten and approved in accordance with our underwriting criteria. We actively monitor the performance of such loans and periodically receive updated financial statements of the borrower from the lead lender. These loans are subjected to regular internal reviews in accordance with our loan policy. We joined a community bank lending network operated by BancAlliance in 2014 in order to have the opportunity to participate in commercial loans and lines of business referred by the network. HarborOne Bank has adopted a loan policy specifically for loans originated through this program that provides for underwriting standards and limits maximum loans to one entity to $2.5 million as well as a total portfolio of $40 million. As of December 31, 2016, total exposure for this program totaled $28.4 million comprising 17 credits. All but one of these relationships were performing in accordance with their payment terms. There is one $2.3 million loan that is rated substandard, on nonaccrual and under a forbearance agreement. At December 31, 2016, the outstanding balances of commercial loan participations purchased outside of the BancAlliance network totaled $7.7 million. We also participate in commercial real estate loans that total $78.3 million.  We were the lead bank in commercial real estate loans and a commercial construction loan with participation balances sold that totaled $41.7 million and $3.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. 
    
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority.    Our lending activities follow written, nondiscriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors and management. Our board of directors has granted loan approval authority to certain executive officers. Commercial loans in excess of any officer's individual authority must be approved by a lending committee comprised of several executive officers. Commercial loans in excess of the lending committee authority must be approved by the board of directors or by the executive committee, which is comprised of our president and chief executive officer and three independent members of our Board of Directors. Commercial loans in excess of the "in-house limit" must be approved by the board of directors. The executive committee of the board of directors reviews all commercial and commercial real estate loan requests greater than $3 million. All mortgage and commercial real estate loans to any single borrower that exceed $3 million and commercial loans that exceed $3 million must be approved by the board of directors. 
    
Loans-to-One Borrower Limit.    The maximum amount that the Bank may lend to one borrower and the borrower's related entities is generally limited, by statute, to 20.0% of the Bank's capital, which is defined under Massachusetts law as the sum of the Bank's capital stock, surplus account and undivided profits. At December 31, 2016, the Bank's regulatory limit on loans-to-one borrower was $65.9 million. At that date, our largest lending relationship totaled $24.3 million and was comprised of three loans secured by commercial real estate. These loans were performing in accordance with their original repayment terms at December 31, 2016. Our internal loans-to-one borrower limit is $38.5 million. 
     Mortgage Banking Activity 
    
In addition to the lending activities previously discussed, we also originate residential mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market through Merrimack Mortgage. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Merrimack Mortgage originated $1.36 billion in mortgage loans. Merrimack Mortgage sells loans on both a servicing-released and a servicing-retained basis. Merrimack Mortgage has contracted with a third party to service the loans for which it retains servicing. 
    
Our overall margin can be affected by the mix of both loan type (conventional loans versus governmental) and loan purpose (purchase versus refinance). Conventional loans include loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards, whereas governmental loans are those loans guaranteed or insured by the federal government, such as a Federal Housing Authority Veterans’ Administration loan.
     Investment Activities 
    
General.    At December 31, 2016 securities totaled $184.4 million. The securities portfolio consists of U.S. government obligations, residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, state, county and municipal bonds and small business administration asset-backed securities. The goals of our investment policy are to provide and maintain liquidity to meet deposit withdrawal and loan funding needs, to help mitigate interest rate and market risk, to diversify our assets, and to generate a reasonable rate of return on funds within the context of our interest rate and credit risk objectives. Our board of directors approves our investment policy which is reviewed annually by the board of directors. Authority to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated to our chief financial officer and chief executive officer. All investment transactions are reviewed at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of directors. We classify the majority of our securities as available-for-sale. 
    
We have legal authority to invest in various types of securities, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises and municipal governments, deposits at the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”), certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions and investment grade corporate bonds. We also are required to maintain an investment in FHLB

stock. While we have the authority under applicable law to invest in marketable equity securities and derivative securities, we had no investments in such securities at December 31, 2016. 
     Sources of Funds 
    
General.    Deposits, borrowings and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. 
    
Deposit Accounts.    At December 31, 2016, total deposits were $1.81 billion. Deposits are attracted from within our market area by sales efforts of our retail branch network, municipal department and commercial loan officers, advertising and through our website. We offer a broad selection of deposit instruments, including noninterest-bearing demand deposits (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing demand accounts (such as NOW and money market accounts), savings accounts and term certificates of deposit. We also offer a variety of deposit accounts designed for businesses and municipalities operating in our market area. Our business banking deposit products include a commercial checking account and checking accounts specifically designed for small businesses. We also offer remote deposit capture products for business customers to meet their online banking needs. Additionally, we offer sweep accounts and money market accounts for businesses. Additionally, the Bank has a municipal banking department that provides core depository services to local municipalities. At December 31, 2016 municipal deposits totaled $180.6 million.
    
The Bank utilizes a deposit listing service which targets institutional funds throughout the country. We generally prohibit the withdrawal of our listing service deposits prior to maturity. Also, when rates and terms are favorable, the Bank supplements the customer deposit base with brokered deposits. At December 31, 2016, we had $54.0 million of institutional deposits and $54.1 million of brokered deposits, which each represented 3.0%, respectively, of total deposits at December 31, 2016 with such funds having a weighted average remaining term to maturity of 1.5 years. In a rising rate environment, we may be unwilling or unable to pay a competitive rate. To the extent that such deposits do not remain with us, they may need to be replaced with borrowings, which could increase our cost of funds and negatively impact our interest rate spread, financial condition and results of operation. 
    
Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, our liquidity needs, profitability to us, and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing on a weekly basis. Our deposit pricing strategy has generally been to offer competitive rates and to offer periodically special rates in order to attract deposits of a specific type or term. 
    
Borrowings.    As of December 31, 2016, total borrowings were $275.1 million. Borrowings consist of short-term and long-term obligations from the FHLB. The Bank is a member of the FHLB Boston which provides access to wholesale funding to supplement our supply of investable funds. The FHLB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for its member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our whole first mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution's net worth or on the FHLB's assessment of the institution's creditworthiness. At December 31, 2016, based on available collateral and our ownership of FHLB stock, and based upon our internal policy, we had access to additional FHLB advances of up to $345.0 million. All of our borrowings from the FHLB are secured by a blanket lien on residential real estate and government-sponsored enterprises and mortgage-backed securities obligations. 
    
The Share Insurance Fund of the Co-operative Central Bank provides for borrowings for liquidity purposes and is available to all co-operative member banks. Loan advances will generally be made on an unsecured basis provided that the aggregate loan balance is less than 5.0% of total deposits of the member bank; the member bank's primary capital ratio is in excess of 5.0%; the member bank meets the required CAMELS rating; and the quarterly and year-to-date net income before extraordinary items is positive. At December 31, 2016, we had $5.0 million of borrowing capacity with the Co-operative Central Bank, none of which was outstanding. 
    
The Company also has an available line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston secured by 73% of the carrying value of indirect auto loans with an amortized balance amounting to $207.9 million of which no amount was outstanding at December 31, 2016.

 Supervision and Regulation
     General 
    
The Bank is a Massachusetts stock co-operative bank and the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which in turn is majority owned by the MHC. The MHC and the Company are registered bank holding companies. The Bank's deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and by the Share Insurance Fund established by Massachusetts General Laws, or the "MGL," for amounts in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, its primary federal regulator and deposit insurer. The Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. The Bank must comply with consumer protection regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). HarborOne Bank is a member of and owns stock in the FHLB of Boston, which is one of the 12 regional banks in the FHLB System. 
    
As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Company is also subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws.
    
The federal and state regulatory and supervisory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance funds, rather than for the protection of other creditors or shareholders. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies concerning the establishment of deposit insurance assessment fees, classification of assets and establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the Massachusetts legislature, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve or the United States Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Bank. 
    
Set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Bank and the Company. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Company. 
     Holding Company Regulation 
    
General.     The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, or BHCA. As such, the Company is registered with the Federal Reserve and subject to regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve has enforcement authority over the Company. Among other things, this authority enables the Federal Reserve to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the Bank. 
    
Permissible Activities.    A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5.0% of any class of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities that the Federal Reserve had determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto as of November 11, 1999. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve had determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies. A bank holding company that is well capitalized and well managed within the meaning of applicable regulations and whose subsidiary depository institutions are well capitalized, well managed and meet certain additional requirements, may elect to become a "financial holding company." Such an election allows a bank holding company to engage in a broader array of financial activities, including insurance and investment banking activities. 
    
Acquisition of Control.    The BHCA provides that no company may directly or indirectly acquire control of a bank without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Any company that acquires control of a bank becomes a "bank holding company" subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve. Pursuant to federal regulations, the term "company" is defined to include 

 
  11

 

banks, corporations, partnerships, associations, and certain trusts and other entities, and a company has "control" of a bank or other company if the company owns, controls or holds with power to vote 25.0% or more of any class of voting stock of the bank or other company, controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the bank or other company or if the Federal Reserve determines, after notice and opportunity for hearings that the Company has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or other company. In addition, a bank holding company must obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to acquiring voting securities of a bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the bank holding company would control more than 5.0% of any class of voting stock of the bank or bank holding company. 
    
In evaluating applications by bank holding companies to acquire banks or bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve must consider, among other things, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institutions involved, the convenience and needs of the community, the extent to which a proposed acquisition, merger or consolidation would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system, and competitive factors. The Federal Reserve may not approve a transaction that would result in a monopoly and may not approve a transaction that would substantially lessen competition in any banking market unless it finds that the anticompetitive effects are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. In addition to the approval of the Federal Reserve, prior approval may also be necessary from other agencies having supervisory jurisdiction over the bank to be acquired before any bank acquisition can be completed. 
    
Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act, no person, directly or indirectly or acting in concert with one or more other persons, may acquire control of an insured depository institution or a depository institution holding company unless the appropriate federal banking agency has been given 60 days prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition. The Federal Reserve is the appropriate federal banking agency with respect to an acquisition of control of a bank holding company. Acquisitions subject to approval under the BHCA are exempt from the prior notice requirement. Control, as defined under the Change in Bank Control Act, as implemented by the Federal Reserve with respect to bank holding companies, means the power to directly or indirectly direct the management or policies of a bank holding company or to vote 25.0% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. Acquisition of more than 10.0% of any class of a bank holding company's voting stock is subject to a rebuttable presumption of control by the Federal Reserve if the bank holding company has registered securities under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act or if no other person will own, control or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting stock immediately after the acquisition. There are also rebuttable presumptions in the regulations concerning whether a group is "acting in concert," including presumed concerted action among members of an "immediate family." Accordingly, the filing of a notice with the Federal Reserve would be required before any person or group of persons acting in concert could acquire 10.0% or more of the common stock of the Company, unless the person or group of persons files a rebuttal of control that is accepted by the Federal Reserve. 
    
The Federal Reserve may prohibit a proposed acquisition of control if it finds, among other things, that:
    
· | the acquisition would result in a monopoly or substantially lessen competition;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the financial condition of the acquiring person might jeopardize the financial stability of the institution;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the competence, experience or integrity of the acquiring person indicates that it would not be in the interest of the depositors or the public to permit the acquisition of control by such person; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the acquisition would have an adverse effect on the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Capital.    The Company is subject to the Federal Reserve's capital adequacy regulations for bank holding companies (on a consolidated basis). These capital standards have historically been similar to, though less stringent than, those of the FDIC for the Bank. Subject to certain exceptions, including an exception for bank holding companies with less than $1 billion of assets, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve to establish, for all bank holding companies, minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for insured depository institutions. Under regulations enacted by the Federal Reserve and generally effective January 1, 2015, all such bank holding companies are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are the same as or more stringent than the capital requirements applicable to the Bank. These capital requirements include provisions that, when applicable, might limit the ability of the Company to pay dividends to its shareholders or repurchase its shares. For a description of these capital requirements, see "—Federal Banking Regulation—Capital Requirements."
    
Source of Strength.    The Dodd-Frank Act codified the requirement that holding companies act as a source of financial strength. The Federal Reserve policy requires bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their depository institution subsidiaries by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 

 
  12

 


    
Dividends.    The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company's net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company's overall rate or earnings retention is inconsistent with the company's capital needs and overall financial condition. The policy statement also states that a bank holding company should inform and consult with the Federal Reserve supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the bank holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. In addition, the ability of the Company to pay dividends may be restricted if the Bank becomes undercapitalized. 
    
Massachusetts Holding Company Regulation.    Under the Massachusetts banking laws, a company owning or controlling two or more banking institutions, including a co-operative bank, is regulated as a bank holding company. The term "company" is defined by the Massachusetts banking laws similarly to the definition of "company" under the Bank Holding Company Act. Each Massachusetts bank holding company: (i) must obtain the approval of the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation before engaging in certain transactions, such as the acquisition of more than 5.0% of the voting stock of another banking institution; (ii) must register and file reports with the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks; and (iii) is subject to examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks. Recent legislation enacted in Massachusetts provides an exemption from the requirement to obtain Board of Bank Incorporation approval for certain transactions involving a bank merger or consolidation subject to approval by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks. In addition, for a period of three years following completion of a stock issuance by a subsidiary of a mutual holding company, no person may directly or indirectly offer to acquire or acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10.0% of any class of equity security of such subsidiary without prior written approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks. 
     Federal Banking Regulation 
    
Business Activities.    Under federal law, all state-chartered FDIC-insured banks, including co-operative banks, have been limited in their activities as principal and in their equity investments to the type and the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law. Federal law permits exceptions to these limitations. The maximum permissible investment is the lesser of 100.0% of Tier 1 capital or the maximum amount permitted by Massachusetts law. Such grandfathered authority may be terminated under certain circumstances, including a change in charter or a determination by the FDIC that such investments pose a safety and soundness risk. 
    
The FDIC is also authorized to permit state banks to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 specified that a state bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a "financial subsidiary," if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes. 
    
Capital Requirements.    The Federal Reserve has issued risk-based and leverage capital rules applicable to bank holding companies such as the Company, and the FDIC has issued similar rules that apply to insured state nonmember banks, such as the Bank. These rules are intended to reflect the relationship between the banking organization's capital and the degree of risk associated with its operations based on transactions recorded on-balance sheet as well as off-balance sheet items. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels discussed below, due to the banking organization's financial condition or actual or anticipated growth. 
    
The capital adequacy rules define qualifying capital instruments and specify minimum amounts of capital as a percentage of assets that banking organizations are required to maintain. Common equity Tier 1 capital for banks and bank holding companies consists of common stockholders' equity and related surplus. Tier 1 capital for banks and bank holding companies generally consists of the sum of common shareholders' equity, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and related surplus and, in certain cases and subject to limitations, minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, other non-qualifying intangible assets and certain other 

 
  13

 

deductions. Tier 2 capital generally consists of hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt securities, cumulative perpetual preferred stock, term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock, and, subject to limitations, allowances for loan losses. The sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital less certain required deductions represents qualifying total risk-based capital.
    
Under the capital rules, risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing Tier 1 and total risk-based capital, respectively, by risk-weighted assets. Assets and off-balance sheet credit equivalents are assigned to one of several risk-weight categories, based primarily on relative risk. The rules require banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0% and a leverage ratio of 4.0%. Additionally, subject to a transition schedule, the capital rules require a bank holding company to establish a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in an amount above the minimum risk-based capital requirements equal to 2.5% of total risk weighted assets, or face restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, pay discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases.  The new capital conservation buffer requirement began phasing in on January 1, 2016.
    
A bank holding company, such as the Company, is considered "well capitalized" if the bank holding company (i) has a total risk based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0%, and (iii) is not subject to any written agreement order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. In addition, under the FDIC's prompt corrective action rules, an insured state nonmember bank is considered "well capitalized" if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater; (iii) a common Tier 1 equity ratio of 6.5% or greater, (iv) a leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or greater; and (v) is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.  
    
The Company and the Bank are considered "well capitalized" under all regulatory definitions. 
    
Bank Dividends.    A state non-member bank may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required by the FDIC's regulatory capital regulations or for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form. In addition, beginning in 2016, the Bank's ability to pay dividends will be limited if the Bank does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the new capital rules, which may limit the ability of the Bancorp to pay dividends to its shareholders. See "—Capital Requirements."
    
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.    All institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act, or the "CRA," and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a state non-member bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution's record of compliance with the CRA. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a state non-member bank, to assess the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of an institution's CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. An institution's failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. The CRA requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating. The Bank received a "Satisfactory" CRA rating in its most recent federal examination. 
    
Massachusetts has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA that is applicable to the Bank. The Massachusetts version is generally similar to the CRA but uses a five-tiered descriptive rating system. Massachusetts law requires the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks to consider, but not be limited to, a bank's record of performance under Massachusetts law in considering any application by the bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution. The Bank's most recent rating under Massachusetts law was "Satisfactory." 
    
In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.

  Transactions with Related Parties.    An insured depository institution's authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as the Bank; however, a subsidiary of a bank that engages in bank permissible activities is generally not treated as an affiliate. The MHC and the Company will be affiliates of HarborOne Bank because of their control of HarborOne Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. Transactions with affiliates also must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, generally not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the insured depository institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. 
    
The Bank's authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10.0% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank's capital. 
    
In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by HarborOne Bank's loan committee or board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved. 
    
Enforcement.    The FDIC has extensive enforcement responsibility over state non-member banks and has authority to bring enforcement actions against all "institution-affiliated parties," including directors, officers, shareholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an institution. Formal enforcement action by the FDIC may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day. The FDIC is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was "critically undercapitalized" on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became "critically undercapitalized." The FDIC may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non-member bank under specified circumstances, including: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; (4) insufficient capital; or (5) the incurrence of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution's capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance. 
    
Standards for Safety and Soundness.    Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties. 
    
Interstate Banking and Branching.    Federal law permits well-capitalized and well-managed bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, banks are now permitted to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that branching is authorized by the law of the host state for banks chartered by the host state. 
    
Prompt Corrective Action Regulations.    The FDIC is required by law to take supervisory action against undercapitalized institutions under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution's level of capital. 
    
An institution that has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5% or a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.0% is considered to be "undercapitalized." An 

 
  15

 

institution that has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0% or a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3.0% is considered to be "significantly undercapitalized." An institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2.0% is deemed to be "critically undercapitalized." 
    
Generally, a receiver or conservator must be appointed for an institution that is "critically undercapitalized" within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date that an institution is deemed to have received notice that it is "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" or "critically undercapitalized." Any holding company of an institution that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution's assets at the time it was deemed to be undercapitalized by the FDIC or the amount necessary to restore the institution to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the FDIC notifies the institution that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. Institutions that are undercapitalized become subject to certain mandatory measures such as restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth. The FDIC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. 
    
Insurance of Deposit Accounts.    The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions such as the Bank. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. 
    
 Deposit premiums are based on assets.  To determine its deposit insurance premium, the Bank computes the base amount of its average consolidated assets less its average tangible equity (defined as the amount of Tier 1 capital) and the applicable assessment rate. On April 26, 2016, the FDIC’s Board of Directors adopted a final rule that changed the manner in which deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated for established small banks, generally those banks with less than $10 billion of assets that have been insured for at least five years.  The rule updated the data and methodology that the FDIC uses to determine risk-based assessment rates for these institutions with the intent of better reflecting risks and ensuring that banks that take on greater risks pay more for deposit insurance than their less risky counterparts. The rule revised the financial ratios method used to determine assessment rates for these banks so that it is based on a statistical model that estimates the probability of failure over three years.  The rule eliminated risk categories for established small banks and uses the financial ratios method.  Under this method each of seven financial ratios and a weighted average of CAMELS component ratings will be multiplied by a corresponding pricing multiplier. The sum of these products will be added to a uniform amount, with the resulting sum being an institution’s initial base assessment rate (subject to minimum or maximum assessment rates based on a bank’s CAMELS composite rating).  This method takes into account various measures that are similar to the factors that the FDIC previously considered in assigning institutions to risk categories, including an institution’s leverage ratio, brokered deposit ratio, one year asset growth, the ratio of net income before taxes to total assets and considerations related to asset quality.   Under the small bank pricing rule, beginning the first assessment period after June 30, 2016, where the DIF’s reserve ratio has reached 1.15%, assessments for established small banks with a CAMELS rating of 1 or 2 will range from 1.5 to 16 basis points, after adjustments, while assessment rates for established small banks with a CAMELS composite rating of 4 or 5 may range from 11 to 30 basis points, after adjustments.  Assessments for established small banks with a CAMELS rating of 3 will range from 3 to 30 basis points.
    
In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation, or FICO, is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. As of September 30, 2015, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.600 basis points of total assets less tangible capital. 
    
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
    
Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements.    State non-member banks are prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from extending credit or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.

Federal Reserve System.    Federal Reserve regulations require depository institutions to maintain noninterest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The Bank's required reserves can be in the form of vault cash and, if vault cash does not fully satisfy the required reserves, in the form of a balance maintained with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The Federal Reserve regulations currently require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts except for transaction accounts up to $15.2 million, which are exempt. Transaction accounts greater than $15.2 million up to $110.2 million have a reserve requirement of 3.0%, and those greater than $110.2 million have a reserve requirement of approximately $2.9 million plus 10.0% of the amount over $110.2 million. The Federal Reserve generally makes annual adjustments to the tiered reserves. The Bank is in compliance with these requirements. 
    
Federal Home Loan Bank System.    The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Boston, which is one of the 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks comprising the FHLB System. Each FHLB serves as a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the FHLB, HarborOne Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB. As of December 31, 2016, HarborOne Bank was in compliance with this requirement. Based on redemption provisions of the FHLB, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. HarborOne Bank reviews for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis of the FHLB stock. As of December 31, 2016, no impairment has been recognized. 
    
At its discretion, the FHLB may declare dividends on the stock. The FHLBs are required to provide funds for certain purposes including the resolution of insolvent thrifts in the late 1980s and to contributing funds for affordable housing programs. These requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that the Federal Home Loan Banks pay to their members and result in the FHLBs imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members. As a result of losses incurred, the FHLB of Boston suspended and did not pay dividends in 2009 and 2010. However, the FHLB resumed payment of quarterly dividends in 2011 equal to an annual yield of 0.30% and continued to pay quarterly dividends in 2012 equal to an annual yield of 0.50% and in 2013 equal to an annual yield of 0.38%. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, the FHLB of Boston paid quarterly dividends with an annual yield of 1.49%, 2.54%, and 3.80%, respectively. There can be no assurance that such dividends will continue in the future. Further, there can be no assurance that the impact of recent or future legislation on the FHLBs also will not cause a decrease in the value of the FHLB stock held by the Bank. 
     Massachusetts Banking Laws and Supervision 
    
General.    As a Massachusetts stock co-operative bank, the Bank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and to various Massachusetts statutes and regulations which govern, among other things, investment powers, lending and deposit-taking activities, borrowings, maintenance of surplus and reserve accounts and payment of dividends. In addition, the Bank is subject to Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights laws and regulations. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required for a Massachusetts-chartered bank to establish or close branches, merge with other financial institutions, issue stock and undertake certain other activities. Any Massachusetts bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and directives of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may be sanctioned. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may suspend or remove directors or officers of a bank who have violated the law, conducted a bank's business in a manner that is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the depositors' interests, or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks has the authority to appoint a receiver or conservator if it is determined that the bank is conducting its business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner, and under certain other circumstances. 
    
Lending Activities.    A Massachusetts co-operative bank may make a wide variety of mortgage loans including fixed-rate loans, adjustable-rate loans, variable-rate loans, participation loans, graduated payment loans, construction and development loans, condominium and co-operative loans, second mortgage loans and other types of loans that may be made in accordance with applicable regulations. Commercial loans may be made to corporations and other commercial enterprises with or without security. Consumer and personal loans may also be made with or without security. 
    
Insurance Sales.    A Massachusetts bank may engage in insurance sales activities if the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks has approved a plan of operation for insurance activities and the bank obtains a license from the Massachusetts Division of Insurance. A bank may be licensed directly or indirectly through an affiliate or a subsidiary corporation established for this purpose. HarborOne Bank does not sell or refer insurance products, and has not sought approval for insurance sales activities. 
    
Dividends.    A Massachusetts co-operative bank may declare cash dividends from net profits not more frequently than quarterly. Non-cash dividends may be declared at any time. No dividends may be declared, credited or paid if the bank's capital stock is impaired. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years. Net profits for this

purpose means the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets after deducting current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all federal and state taxes. 
    
Parity Authority.    A Massachusetts bank may, after providing 30 days' prior notice to the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, exercise any power and engage in any activity that has been authorized for national banks, federal savings associations or state banks in a state other than Massachusetts, provided that the activity is permissible under applicable federal law and not specifically prohibited by Massachusetts law. Such powers and activities must be subject to the same limitations and restrictions imposed on the national bank, federal thrift or out-of-state bank that exercised the power or activity. 
    
Loans-to-One Borrower Limitations.    Massachusetts banking law grants broad lending authority. However, with certain limited exceptions, total obligations to one borrower may not exceed 20.0% of the total of the bank's capital stock, surplus and undivided profits. 
    
Loans to a Bank's Insiders.    Massachusetts banking law prohibits any executive officer or director of a bank from borrowing or guaranteeing extensions of credit by such bank except to the extent permitted by federal law. 
    
Regulatory Enforcement Authority.    Any Massachusetts co-operative bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and directives of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance, including revocation of its charter. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the bank's business in an unsafe or unsound manner or contrary to the depositors interests or been negligent in the performance of their duties. Upon finding that a bank has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the bank concerned. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks also has authority to take possession of a bank and appoint a liquidating agent under certain conditions such as an unsafe and unsound condition to transact business, the conduct of business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner of impaired capital. In addition, Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to HarborOne Bank permit private individual and class action law suits and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damage and attorney's fees in the case of certain violations of those statutes. 
    
Co-operative Central Bank and Share Insurance Fund.    All Massachusetts-chartered co-operative banks are required to be members of the Co-operative Central Bank, which maintains the Share Insurance Fund that insures co-operative bank deposits in excess of federal deposit insurance coverage. The Co-operative Central Bank is authorized to charge co-operative banks an annual assessment fee on deposit balances in excess of amounts insured by the FDIC. Assessment rates are based on the institution's risk category, similar to the method currently used to determine assessments by the FDIC discussed above under "—Federal Banking Regulation—Insurance of Deposit Accounts."
    
Protection of Personal Information.    Massachusetts has adopted regulatory requirements intended to protect personal information. The requirements, which became effective March 1, 2010, are similar to existing federal laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that require organizations to establish written information security programs to prevent identity theft. The Massachusetts regulation also contains technology system requirements, especially for the encryption of personal information sent over wireless or public networks or stored on portable devices. 
    
Massachusetts has additional statutes and regulations that are similar to certain of the federal provisions discussed below.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     
In addition, the CFPB issues regulations and standards under these federal consumer protection laws that affect our consumer businesses. These include regulations setting "ability to repay" and "qualified mortgage" standards for residential mortgage loans and mortgage loan servicing and originator compensation standards. The Bank is evaluating recent regulations and proposals, and devotes significant compliance, legal and operational resources to compliance with consumer protection regulations and standards.
        
The operations of the Bank also are subject to the:

· | USA PATRIOT Act, which requires depository institutions to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, and due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements that also apply to financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties.

      Federal Securities Laws 
    
Our common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 12(b) of the securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
