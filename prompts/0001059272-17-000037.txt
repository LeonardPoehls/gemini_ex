ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
Historically, we designed, developed and produced a distinctive line of contemporary women’s apparel and accessories that is unique, sophisticated and timelessly sexy. We were founded by Manny Mashouf, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. We opened our first store in San Francisco, California in 1976, which was also the year we incorporated in California. We marketed our products under the bebe and BEBE SPORT brand names through our retail stores, the significant majority of which were bebe stores, including an on-line store at www.bebe.com, and as many as 39 bebe outlet stores. The 82 international licensees’ operated stores in 22 countries and, pursuant to our product licensing, through certain select domestic and international retailers. 
Operating Strategy
Strategic Partnership 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we expanded upon our strategic joint venture arrangement entered into during fiscal 2016, and have closed all of our retail stores, sold our inventory, furnishings, trade fixtures, equipment, improvements in real property, purchase orders related to our website and international wholesale business and are committed to selling our Los Angeles Design Studio. Under this partnership, bebe contributed all of its trademarks, trademark license arrangements and related intellectual property, including domain names, social media accounts and agreements with certain of its international distributors to its joint venture BB Brand Holdings LLC (the “Joint Venture”). Our partner in the venture, Bluestar Alliance, LLC (“Bluestar”) continues to leverage its existing brand management organization and infrastructure to develop a wholesale domestic and international lifestyle licensing business for the Joint Venture and will manage its day-to-day operations. Going forward, the Joint Venture will aggressively pursue a licensing strategy designed to capitalize on the value of our brand in all categories and channels on a global scale. We expect the Joint Venture to generate long-term, committed royalties from prospective licensees of the bebe brand name. 
Historical
Historically, our objective has been to satisfy the fashion needs of the confident, modern woman. The principal elements of our operating strategy to achieve this objective were as follows:
1. Provide distinctive fashion throughout a broad product line to fulfill everyday wardrobe needs across a variety of occasions. Our designers and merchandisers were inspired by global fashion trends. They interpreted contemporary designs, colors and fabrications into our products to address the lifestyle needs of our customer. Our in-house design team allowed us to react quickly to fashion trends, bringing newness into the merchandise mix to complement our core assortment. 
2. Vertically integrate design, production, merchandising and retail functions. Our vertical integration for the majority of our bebe branded product enabled us to respond quickly to changing fashion trends, reduced risk of excess inventory and produced distinctive quality merchandise.

3. Manage merchandise mix. Our approach to merchandising and proactive inventory management was critical to our success. By actively monitoring sell-through rates and the mix of categories and products in our stores, we were better able to respond to emerging trends in a timely manner thereby better maximizing sales opportunities.
4. Operate an omni-channel strategy to engage our customer wherever she shops. Our omni-channel strategy allowed our customer to shop in stores, on-line and via mobile devices and enhanced our ability to compete effectively against a variety of retail formats.
5. Control distribution of merchandise. We distributed our merchandise, other than licensed products, through company owned stores including on-line. This distribution strategy enabled us to control pricing, flow of goods, visual presentation and customer experience. We sought to ensure brand equity through this exclusive distribution. During fiscal 2017, through the Joint Venture, we saw an expansion of the use of the bebe brand name to new products, new geographies, and new domestic channels. Licensed products that will be sold through new domestic channels were complementary to existing bebe products. 
6. Enhance brand image. We attracted customers through edgy, high-impact, visual advertising campaigns using print, outdoor, in-store, direct mail and e-mail communication vehicles. We also offered a line of merchandise branded with the distinctive bebe logo to increase brand awareness. Our marketing campaign was aligned across traditional and new media and focused on messaging that speaks to the confident bebe woman.
Seasonality
Our business was seasonal in nature, with sales peaking during the second fiscal quarter, primarily during the holiday season in November and December. During each of fiscal 2017 and 2016, the second fiscal quarter accounted for approximately 31% of our annual net sales.
Competition
The retail and apparel industries are highly competitive and are characterized by low barriers to entry. We expect competition in such markets, which we are exposed to via the Joint Venture to increase. The primary competitive factors in these markets are: brand name recognition and appeal, sourcing, product styling, product quality, product presentation, product pricing, timeliness of product delivery, store ambiance, customer service and convenience.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we contributed all of our intellectual property, including trademark registrations and applications that were filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other countries for bebe, BEBE SPORT and related marks for many of our core classifications including retail store services, apparel, handbags, jewelry, footwear, fragrance and eyewear and certain design prints and patterns registered with the U.S. Copyright Office, to the Joint Venture. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we also transferred the www.bebe.com domain name, our social media accounts and our international wholesale agreements to the Joint Venture. The Joint Venture in turn intends to license them to one or more third parties.
Information Services and Technology
We are committed to utilizing technology to enhance our competitive position. Our information systems provide data to the entire enterprise to help improve efficiency, visibility and actionable decision making. The core business systems, which consist of both purchased and internally developed software, are accessed over a company-wide network providing employees with access to key business applications.
Our investments in information systems for fiscal 2017 continued to focus on our digital channels, stores, supply chain, central corporate systems and infrastructure.
Employees
As of July 1, 2017, we had 83 employees. Our total employees decreased by approximately 96.8% as compared to the prior fiscal year end reflecting the shutdown of operations. Our employees are not represented by any labor union, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
