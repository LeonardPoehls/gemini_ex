Item 1.      Business
Background
 
On July 31, 2015, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 5, 2015, as amended (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Tempus Applied Solutions Holdings, Inc. (“we”, the “Company” or “Tempus Holdings”); Chart Acquisition Corp. (“Chart”); Tempus Applied Solutions, LLC (“Tempus”); the holders of Tempus’ membership interests named in the Merger Agreement (the “Members”); Benjamin Scott Terry and John G. Gulbin III, together, in their capacity under the Merger Agreement as the representative of the Members for the purposes set forth therein (the “Members’ Representative”); Chart Merger Sub Inc.; Chart Financing Sub Inc.; TAS Merger Sub LLC; TAS Financing Sub Inc.; Chart Acquisition Group LLC, in its capacity under the Merger Agreement as the representative of the equity holders of Chart and Tempus Holdings (other than the Members and their successors and assigns) in accordance with the terms thereof (the “Chart Representative”); and, for the limited purposes set forth therein, Chart Acquisition Group LLC (“CAG”), Joseph Wright and Cowen Investments LLC (“Cowen”):

i. | Chart Financing Sub Inc. and Chart Merger Sub Inc. merged with and into Chart, with Chart continuing as the surviving entity, 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii. | TAS Financing Sub Inc. and TAS Merger Sub LLC merged with and into Tempus, with Tempus continuing as the surviving entity, and 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iii. | each of Chart and Tempus became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. 
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We refer to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as the “Business Combination”.
 
The consummation of the Business Combination was preceded by a series of privately negotiated transactions, referred to collectively as the Financing, involving aggregate cash investments of $10.5 million by three outside investor entities (or affiliates thereof) that had not previously invested in Chart or Tempus, whom we refer to as the New Investors; aggregate cash investments of $5.0 million by CAG, Mr. Wright and Cowen, whom we collectively refer to as the Chart Affiliate Investors; and a cash investment of $500,000 by the former Chief Financial Officer of Tempus (through his individual retirement account), whom we refer to in such capacity as the Tempus Affiliate Investor. We refer to the Tempus Affiliate Investor and the Chart Affiliate Investors together as the Affiliate Investors, and we refer to the Affiliate Investors and the New Investors together as the Investors.
 
In the Business Combination, the Members received 3,642,084 shares of our common stock, or the Merger Shares, in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Tempus. The number of Merger Shares received reflected a downward merger consideration adjustment (in accordance with the Merger Agreement) of 57,916 shares of our common stock, based on Tempus’ estimated working capital and debt as of the closing of the Business Combination. In addition, pursuant to the earn-out provisions of the Merger Agreement, the Members have the right to receive up to an additional 6,300,000 shares of our common stock upon the achievement of certain financial milestones, which shares are referred to as the Earn-out Shares.
 
Additionally in the Business Combination, Chart stockholders and Chart warrant holders received shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in exchange for their existing shares of Chart common stock and existing Chart warrants, on a one-for-one basis. We refer to the warrants we issued in exchange for Chart warrants as the “IPO Warrants”. The issuance of our common stock and IPO Warrants to former holders of Chart common stock and warrants in connection with the Business Combination was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, referred to as the Securities Act, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-201424), referred to as the Form S-4, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, referred to as the SEC, and declared effective on July 17, 2015.
 
In connection with the Business Combination, (i) the Affiliate Investors received an aggregate of 1,375,000 shares of our common stock, 1,031,250 Series A-2 Warrants to purchase common stock or Preferred Stock, which we refer to as Series A-2 Warrants, and 343,750 Series B-2 Warrants to purchase common stock or Preferred Stock, which we refer to as Series B-2 Warrants, (we refer to the securities described in this clause (i) collectively as the Affiliate Investor Securities) and (ii) the New Investors received an aggregate of 1,255,265 shares of our common stock, 1,369,735 shares of our Preferred Stock, 1,968,750 Series A-1 Warrants and 656,250 Series B-1 Warrants (we refer to the securities described in this clause (ii) collectively as the New Investor Securities, and we refer to the Affiliate Investor Securities and the New Investor Securities collective as the Financing Securities).

On August 14, 2015, we entered into, and consummated the transactions contemplated by a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with CAG, Mr. Wright and Cowen, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, these investors acquired from us, for an aggregate purchase price of $1 million, (i) an aggregate of 250,000 shares of common stock, (ii) Series A-3 Warrants to acquire an aggregate of 187,500 shares of common stock or Preferred Stock, which we refer to as the Series A-3 Warrants, and (iii) Series B-3 Warrants to acquire an aggregate of 62,500 shares of common stock or Preferred Stock, which we refer to as the Series B-3 Warrants (we refer to the securities described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), collectively, as the Purchased Securities). Of the Purchased Securities, (x) CAG acquired 154,168 shares of common stock, 115,626 Series A-3 Warrants and 38,542 Series B-3 Warrants, (y) Mr. Wright acquired 8,332 shares of common stock, 6,249 Series A-3 Warrants and 2,083 Series B-3 Warrants, and (z) Cowen acquired 87,500 shares of common stock, 65,625 Series A-3 Warrants and 21,875 Series B-3 Warrants.
 
In February 2016, all of our outstanding Series B-1 Warrants were exercised. In June 2016, all of our outstanding Series B-2 and B-3 Warrants were exercised. No Series B Warrants remain outstanding.
 
Overview 
 
The following describes the business historically operated by Tempus Applied Solutions LLC and its subsidiaries under the “Tempus” name as an independent enterprise prior to the Business Combination and operated by Tempus Applied Solutions Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Tempus Applied Solutions LLC, after the Business Combination.
 
We provide turnkey flight operations; customized design, engineering and modification solutions; and training services that support critical aviation mission requirements for such customers as the U.S. Department of Defense (the “DoD”), U.S. intelligence agencies, foreign governments, heads of state and high net worth individuals worldwide. Our management and employees have extensive experience in the design and implementation of special mission aircraft modifications related to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (“ISR”) systems, new generation command, control and communications systems and VIP interior components; the provision of ongoing operational support, including flight crews, maintenance and other services to customers; and the operation and leasing of corporate, VIP and other specialized aircraft.
 
Our principal areas of expertise include:
 

● | Flight Operations: turnkey flight operations and related support services required by the customer for the ultimate successful execution of its mission, including leasing, planning, maintenance, training, logistics support and other support services; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Design, Engineering and Modification: the modification of aircraft for airborne research and development, the addition and upgrading of ISR and electronic warfare capabilities and wide body aircraft VIP interior conversions. 

 
We operate out of our corporate headquarters in Williamsburg, Virginia. We utilize hangar space in San Marcos, Texas to provide facilities for flight training and operations support for our customers in that region. Additionally, we are able to access hangar space in Brunswick, Maine as needed, to provide facilities for aircraft production support for our customers.
 
Industry
 
Our industry and target markets are largely influenced by the DoD budget and overall trends in the commercial aircraft and business jet markets.

Defense 
 
The DoD fiscal year 2018 budget request is approximately $639 billion, representing a significant 9.6% increase in proposed spending over the prior year and a change in priority for defense spending in the new administration.
Commercial Aircraft
 
Commercial aircraft activity continues to rebound from the financial crisis. According to the International Air Transport Association, international passenger air traffic increased 9.6% year-over-year as of January 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Business jet deliveries fell in 2016. Business jet deliveries declined an estimated 3.2% in 2016 compared to 2015, according to Jetcraft’s most recent market analysis, although long-term forecasts suggest that growth may return to the business jet market in 2018.
Aircraft Leasing
 
The U.S. government has adopted a strategy of employing the custom integration of sensors and command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) solutions into existing aircraft to support intelligence and communication activities in forward deployed areas. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the U.S. government owns and leases over 1,700 aircraft, which play a critical role in supporting various agencies’ mission-related responsibilities and operations. As acquisition and procurement budgets have tightened, government customers have increasingly turned to contract leasing solutions through operations and maintenance funding to reduce up-front cost and “red tape” associated with large procurement processes.
Maintenance and Modifications
 
We expect a significant number of retrofit modifications to be required for high end corporate aircraft as a result of recently initiated government regulatory requirements. In 2013, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) instituted a mandate requiring the installation of Future Air Navigation Systems (FANS) 1/A and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology on aircraft flying in the North Atlantic Track System (NATS), European and American airspace.
Competitive Strengths
 
Industry-Leading Expertise
 
Our executive management team possesses over 25 years of combined experience in the special mission aircraft industry. The team brings a broad deal-sourcing network of trusted relationships within the U.S. government, a blend of asset knowledge and technical expertise and a track record of realizing proceeds from investments through a number of exit alternatives. Since 2009, our executive team has won and led contracts with U.S. government end users in excess of $500 million. Our network of highly trained and experienced technicians offers complex design and engineering capabilities, with expertise covering a wide range of aircraft platforms, and has successfully completed projects with strict parameters and specifications for the U.S. government. Our network of highly trained personnel have designed, integrated, and certified more than 70 aircraft, modified to conduct special mission operations in some of the most remote and harsh environments globally.
Leasing Solution Aligned with the DoD’s Aircraft Utilization Strategy
 
Downward pressure on acquisition/procurement budgets has made the acquisition of assets difficult for U.S. government agencies seeking customized C4ISR solutions. The rapid advancement of technology will continue to force these agencies to move to a contract leasing model for aviation assets operated according to FAA standards. We are well-positioned to capitalize on this shifting strategy by offering a leasing solution of repurposed aircraft with advanced intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance equipment as well as new generation command, control and communications systems for expeditionary use in forward deployed areas. By taking advantage of the commercial support network for popular business aircraft with a significant worldwide installed base, our solutions allow U.S. government contractors and their end customers to avoid replicating expensive logistics support tails, which can be costly and highly inefficient for smaller numbers of aircraft.

Significant Barriers to Entry
 
Significant entry barriers exist in our business and market due to the knowledge, regulatory licensing and capital required to purchase, modify, and maintain specialized aircraft assets. Our management team maintains a deep knowledge of both the commercial aviation and U.S. government special mission aircraft industry, which allows us to mobilize customized solutions that meet the specifications of our customers. Our personnel have earned the security clearances required to support various agencies within the DoD and intelligence community. Our leasing model is well-positioned to be of benefit to U.S. government contractors that generally have not wanted to own or manage aircraft assets due to their unwillingness to carry high levels of capital assets. Traditional leasing firms do not hold the requisite expertise, market knowledge or security clearances to address the unique U.S. government end customer.
High Switching Costs for Customers
 
Our strategy is to integrate, and then provide ongoing operational services for, aircraft that will be subject to extensive non-flight-related modifications, including VIP passenger accommodations for commercial customers and surveillance and communication technology for U.S. government end users. These solutions are highly engineered and place high switching costs on the customer due to the modification costs, which can total up to 50% - 200% of the base value of the aircraft, and prolonged aircraft downtime, typically 6 to 18 months, associated with modifying and outfitting an aircraft with the desired equipment. The combination of additional cost and increased time on the ground mitigates contract recompete risk for us.
 
Access to Secure, State-of-the-Art Facilities Strategically Located in Brunswick, ME
 
We have access to hangar space in Brunswick, Maine which provides facilities for aircraft production support for our customers. The secure hangar facilities, with access to secure, compartmentalized information facilities, are strategically located on the Eastern seaboard, an area with a highly skilled labor force well suited to work on large structures in interior spaces, given the region’s experience with shipbuilding. This location affords us the ability to more cost effectively accommodate systems integration requests internationally. The air station maintains runways and taxiways certified for B-747, A-340, and C-5 aircraft, which will allow us to provide systems integration and modification services on wide body aircraft.
 
Business Model Provides High Risk-Adjusted Returns
 
Our business model allows us to achieve monthly lease rate factors ranging from 1.3% to 2.5%, compared to typical commercial monthly lease rate factors of less than 1.0%. The experience and track record of management in this market allow for attractive pricing, as risks are well understood and adequately mitigated. We seek to employ conservative leverage, secured by modified aircraft assets under contract with end users, to be backed by cash flows that can support both interest payments and future investment in the business.
Meaningful Marketing and Cross-Selling Opportunities within Targeted Customer Base
 
Our strategy of providing turnkey and customized design, engineering, modification and integration services and operations solutions that support aircraft critical mission requirements helps position us to meet other aviation needs of our customers. For example, we expect to be able to procure or broker an underutilized and undervalued asset for a customer and develop the engineering and perform the modifications required to repurpose the aircraft. Once complete, we may sell or lease the repurposed aircraft to the end customer. Ideally, we will modify an aircraft for an operationally specific purpose, after which the customer will hire us to assist in an operational capacity. Cross-selling opportunities such as these should allow us to maintain and expand business with existing customers as well as procure new customers.

Growth Strategy
 
Re-enter the Market for Turnkey Solutions for Government Customers
 
Our CEO, Mr. Terry, has previously run, grown and sold two companies that provided turnkey commercial aviation services for government customers, namely Flight International and Orion Air Group Services (“Orion”). Upon the sale of Orion, which was founded by Mr. Terry, he entered into a non-compete agreement which has expired. Our management and employees retain extensive relationships in the previously restricted market.
Continued Additions of Complementary Capabilities
 
We plan to opportunistically add related capabilities within target end-markets, including through acquisitions.
  
Capitalize on Demand for Special Mission Modifications and Aircraft Leasing Solutions
 
The majority of our aircraft will be modified and equipped to perform C4ISR missions, logistics and training support for U.S. government contractors and commercial customers. We expect to maintain our competitive advantage of offering a contract leasing model for aviation assets due to continued downward pressure on acquisition and procurement budgets. The DoD and other U.S. government customers have found contract leasing solutions to be a more nimble procurement method than large aircraft acquisitions.
Expand into International Markets
 
International markets provide attractive opportunities for both leased and managed aircraft. International lease programs tend to be more comprehensive than domestic opportunities and guaranteed for longer terms, as many international governments are not bound by the one-year budget cycle of the U.S. government’s appropriations process. Aircraft management customers with significant international flight operations are attractive to us, given their requirements for long-range and expensive aircraft.
Address Key Aviation Regulatory Mandates with Design and Engineering Capabilities
 
Regulatory mandates for FANS 1/A began in 2013 in the U.S and abroad, and will require FANS / ADS-B compliance on certain preferred air routes on a rolling basis over the next five years. NATS will require FANS 1/A technology at optimum altitudes, expanding to most of the North Atlantic airspace by 2017. Non-compliant aircraft will be prohibited from this airspace, increasing total trip distance, time, fuel emissions and operating costs. We have proactively expanded our design and engineering capabilities relating to FANS 1/A, providing legacy Gulfstream aircraft owners a fully integrated approach to becoming compliant.
Opportunistically Invest in Aircraft
 
We will draw on years of experience to identify transactions that offer the opportunity to realize superior returns over the life of an aircraft and benefit from the arbitrage gained from transitioning and modifying idle or undervalued aircraft into configurations that provide valuable services to the owner or end user. We seek aircraft investments that have the following characteristics:

● | Aircraft under contract to the U.S. or foreign government agencies; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Business aircraft expected to retain attractive residual value; 
● | Business aircraft supported by an efficient worldwide commercial infrastructure ; and 
● | Highly modified business aircraft.
