 Item 1. Business.
 Our Company
 Overview
 We are a multinational provider of Water‑as‑a‑Service, or WAAS, solutions that provide our customers with a reliable and cost‑effective source of clean drinking and process water primarily under long‑term contracts that minimize capital investment by the customer. We believe our WAAS business model offers a differentiated value proposition that generates long‑term customer relationships, recurring revenue, predictable cash flow and attractive rates of return. We generate revenue from our operations in the United States, the Caribbean and South America, and are pursuing expansion opportunities in North America, the Caribbean, South America and other select markets.
 We deliver our WAAS solutions through two operating platforms: Seven Seas Water and Quench. Seven Seas Water is a multinational provider of desalination and wastewater treatment solutions, providing approximately 8 billion gallons of potable, high purity industrial grade and ultra‑pure water (which is water that is treated to meet higher purity standards required for industrial, semiconductor, utility or pharmaceutical applications) per year to governmental, municipal, industrial and hospitality customers. Quench, which we acquired in June 2014, is a U.S.‑based provider of Point‑of‑Use, or POU, filtered water systems and related services to approximately 40,000 institutional and commercial customers, including more than half of the Fortune 500. In our Quench business, our current typical initial contract term is three years with an automatic renewal provision, and our annual unit attrition rate, at December 31, 2016, was approximately 8%, implying an average rental period of more than 11 years. We define “annual unit attrition rate” as a ratio, the numerator of which is the total number of removals of company‑owned and billed rental units during the trailing 12‑month period, and the denominator of which is the average number of company‑owned and billed rental units during the same 12‑month period.
 We leverage our operating and engineering expertise to develop and deliver highly reliable WAAS solutions by applying various water purification technologies, including reverse osmosis, carbon filtration, deionization, membrane bioreactors and ultraviolet sanitization. We operate our water systems, enabling our customers to outsource a non‑core activity without investing significant capital or managerial resources.

 We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on global growth opportunities driven by population growth, increasing urbanization and water scarcity, increasing focus on health and wellness, and the environmental impact of bottled water consumption. We believe our focus on delivering best‑in‑class service and efficiency to our customers will continue to lead to substantial new business, contract extensions and customer expansion opportunities. We also have a demonstrated track record of identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions, with Seven Seas Water and Quench having completed more than a dozen transactions since 2007. We plan to continue to pursue acquisitions that will expand our geographic presence, broaden our service offerings and allow us to move into additional markets.
 We are led by a talented management team with extensive industry experience, engineering knowledge, operational expertise and financial capabilities. Our team has a demonstrated record of execution, having built AquaVenture into a leader in the major markets we serve. Our Seven Seas Water team currently operates ten water treatment facilities and previously designed and operated more than 50 desalination plants with Ionics, Incorporated (a former NYSE‑traded water treatment technology company purchased by General Electric Co. in 2005). Our Quench team has grown Quench’s company‑owned and billed POU filtered water system installed base from approximately 11,300 units in 2009 to more than 90,000 units as of December 31, 2016 through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. As of December 31, 2016, we had 580 employees.
 Corporate Reorganization & Initial Public Offering
 On October 5, 2016, our initial public offering, or IPO, was declared effective and on October 12, 2016, we completed the sale of 7,475,000 ordinary shares at a public offering price of $18.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $118.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
 Prior to our IPO, we completed a series of reorganization transactions, which we refer to as the Corporate Reorganization. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information about the above-mentioned transactions.
 Seven Seas Water
 Our Seven Seas Water business offers WAAS solutions by providing outsourced desalination and wastewater treatment services for governmental, municipal, industrial and hospitality customers. Our solutions utilize seawater reverse osmosis, or SWRO, and other purification technologies to produce potable and high purity industrial process water in high volumes for customers operating in regions with limited access to potable water. We assume responsibility for designing, financing, constructing, operating and maintaining the water treatment facilities. In exchange, we typically enter into long‑term agreements to sell to our customers agreed‑upon quantities of water that meet specified quality standards for a contracted period, for which we are paid based on actual or minimum required unit consumption. We typically enter into contracts with a term of 10 to 20 years, except in situations in which emergency water is needed or we assume an existing contract from an existing operator. With this approach, our customers benefit from a highly reliable, long‑term clean water supply with predictable pricing, low customer capital investment and outsourced management of operations and maintenance.
 We offer customized solutions, often implemented using containerized or modular equipment, which allows us to quickly commission, expand, curtail or move production capacity. We design, procure and engineer systems to meet the customer’s specific requirements with regard to source water conditions and specific water quality and quantity needs. Once a plant commences operations, customer water demand typically increases over time, often leading to plant expansion and contract extension opportunities. We also offer quick deployment solutions to address emergency water shortages, such as those caused by natural disasters or failure and/or overburdening of existing water production infrastructure, and water reuse solutions for industrial users seeking to reuse and/or minimize wastewater.
 We are a leading provider of water to the Caribbean market, where we are currently the primary supplier to the United States Virgin Islands, or USVI, St. Maarten and the British Virgin Islands, or the BVI. We also maintain significant plant operations in Trinidad, Curaçao and Peru. We currently operate ten water treatment facilities in the Caribbean region and South America producing approximately 8 billion gallons of purified water per year under long‑term contracts.
 We expect to grow our Seven Seas Water business by expanding existing operations as customer demand increases and by selectively entering underserved markets through both new project development and acquisitions. We

believe that there are a large number of medium‑scale desalination plants (which we define as plants with approximately 2 million gallons per day, or GPD, to 13 million GPD of output capacity) in operation globally that could benefit from our ownership and operating expertise. Leveraging our strength in the Caribbean market and our reputation for reliability, quality and operating efficiency, we are pursuing new opportunities in North America, the Caribbean, South America and other select markets.
 Build, Own and Operate
 Providing WAAS solutions to our customers is central to our operating model. We typically own, operate and maintain the desalination plants and sell water to our customers pursuant to long‑term contracts. We either design, build and operate our desalination plants or acquire, refurbish and expand existing desalination plants. We assume responsibility for operating and maintaining the plants, including procuring all required equipment and arranging for related civil works. We typically design our desalination plants to exceed contractually required production capacity to ensure reliability, enable expansion to meet increased demand and to have more predictable lifecycle costs. In building our plants, we often use containerized units and modular skids with preconstructed components of the plant, which enables us to commission a plant and commence production more quickly. We also use standardized designs and equipment which help us operate and maintain our plants more efficiently and cost‑effectively and simplify spare parts management.
 Under our WAAS business model, we manage the entire lifecycle of a desalination plant on an outsourced basis for our customers. Typically, a customer commits to purchase water at a fixed price per gallon, subject to adjustment based on a specified index, which meets agreed upon quality standards. Certain of our contracts require customers to purchase a minimum volume of water on a take‑or‑pay basis, while some do not have minimum purchase requirements. In some cases, we satisfy a customer’s water requirements by utilizing our plants as its exclusive water producer. Our water purchase agreements typically provide for initial terms of up to 20 years. Customers may ask us to increase the capacity of plants or to build additional plants to satisfy increased demand for the reliable, high quality water we produce. In connection with expanding capacity, we typically extend the term of the initial contract and reduce the unit cost that the customer pays. We monitor the plants we operate, both remotely and on site. Our facilities are maintained as needed by Seven Seas Water employees.
 Generally, we have the right to decommission and remove our desalination plants upon the expiration or termination of the term of the water supply agreement. Our plants are generally built on property leased from the customer or its related parties pursuant to leases with terms that typically extend longer than the water purchase agreement, so that we may decommission and remove the plant. Certain of our water purchase agreements, however, provide for the transfer of the plant to our customer either at the end of the term of the agreement, upon the termination of the agreement or upon exercise of contractual buyout rights. The purchase prices payable upon exercise of the buyout rights are specified in the agreement and may be either fixed or variable based on factors set forth in the agreement.
 Our Desalination Plants
 We currently operate ten water treatment facilities in the Caribbean and South America. Six exclusively provide water to the local government or government‑owned utility companies and four serve private customers.

 Trinidad
 We built and own and operate a desalination plant currently with a design capacity of 6.7 million GPD located at Point Fortin, Trinidad. Under the terms of the water sale agreement with the Water & Sewerage Authority of Trinidad and Tobago, which we refer to as the Trinidad Water Sale Agreement, we are required to provide a minimum supply of water each month equal to a certain percentage of the design capacity of the plant, and Water & Sewerage Authority of Trinidad and Tobago, or WASA, is required to purchase all of the water we produce each month up to a certain percentage of the design capacity of the plant. If production levels fall below agreed upon contractual minimums, then the water payment owed by WASA to us is reduced. On September 3, 2015, we entered into a fourth amendment to expand the existing desalination plant capacity by approximately 21% and extend the initial term of agreement, which was set to expire in 2026, by 50 months. This expansion was completed in July 2016 and added 1.2 million GPD of capacity to the plant.
 The Trinidad Water Sale Agreement may be terminated upon default. If WASA terminates the Agreement early or is in default, a penalty will be imposed that is based on estimated future production of the plant. Upon termination, we have 120 days to remove our equipment from the site.
 Under the Trinidad Water Sale Agreement, WASA is obligated to provide the electricity needed to operate our plant at no charge to us. We are not responsible for loss of production arising from a disruption to our electrical supply or a change in the quality or quantity of feedwater.
 We sublease the site where the Point Fortin plant is located from WASA, who leases the site from Petrotrin, a state‑owned oil company. The initial term of the lease expires in October 2022, and we have an option to renew for an additional five years.
 United States Virgin Islands
 We built and currently own and operate three principal desalination plants in the United States Virgin Islands with an aggregate design capacity of 7.7 million GPD.
 We sell the water produced at our Richmond Generation Plant on St. Croix and our Randolph Harley Generation Plant on St. Thomas on an as‑demanded basis to the Water & Power Authority of United States Virgin Islands, or VIWAPA, pursuant to the USVI Water Purchase Agreements, the current terms of which expire in 2033. Although the USVI Water Purchase Agreements do not specify a minimum consumption level, they stipulate that Seven Seas Water will be VIWAPA’s exclusive supplier. The current design capacity of our Richmond Generation Plant and the Randolph Harley Generation Plant are 3.7 million GPD and 3.3 million GPD, respectively. Under the USVI Water Purchase Agreements, VIWAPA is obligated to provide the electricity needed to operate our plants at no charge to us, provided that our electrical consumption per thousand gallons of water produced does not exceed certain thresholds. If our electrical consumption does exceed such thresholds, we are required to reimburse VIWAPA at VIWAPA’s then current electricity production cost, subject to adjustment for feedwater quality. We lease the sites where these plants are located from VIWAPA. The leases terminate 180 days after the contract expiration dates to enable us to remove our equipment.
 In addition, we built and currently own and operate a desalination plant with the design capacity of 700,000 GPD on St. Croix. We sell the water produced by this plant under a water sales agreement to support a storage terminal, refinery and marine facility that were owned by Hovensa L.L.C. until January 2016, when these assets were acquired by Limetree Bay Terminals, LLC. We sell the water produced at this plant on a take‑or‑pay basis. Pursuant to an amendment in July 2016, the term of the agreement with Limetree Bay Terminals, LLC was extended to December 2021. 
 Curaçao
 We own and operate a desalination facility in Curaçao with an aggregate design capacity of 4.9 million GPD. We sell the industrial quality water produced at this facility on a take‑or‑pay basis to Curaçao Refinery Utilities Company B.V., a government owned utility that provides utility services to a refinery it has leased to Petróleos de Venezuela S.A., or PdVSA, a state‑owned oil company of Venezuela. The current term of this water sales agreement expires in 2019, but will extend to 2022 if our customer extends the lease of the refinery to PdVSA. Under this water

sales agreement, our customer is obligated to provide the electricity needed to operate our plant at no charge to us. We lease the site where this facility is located.
 St. Maarten
 We own and operate three desalination plants with an aggregate design capacity of 5.8 million GPD in St. Maarten. We built two of these plants and acquired and refurbished the third. We sell the water produced at these plants on a take‑or‑pay basis to the Government of St. Maarten pursuant to the St. Maarten Water Purchase Agreements, the current terms of which expire in 2021. Under the St. Maarten Water Purchase Agreements, we are obligated to pay for the electricity needed to operate our plant at a fixed rate. We lease the sites where these plants are located. The St. Maarten Water Purchase Agreements require us to transfer ownership of the plants to the government upon the expiration of the water purchase agreements and under other certain circumstances. British Virgin Islands
 In June 2015, we purchased the capital stock of Biwater Holdings, a subsidiary of which owns and operates a desalination plant with the design capacity of 2.8 million GPD located on Tortola, BVI. We sell the water produced at this plant on a take‑or‑pay basis to the Government of the BVI pursuant to a water purchase agreement, the current term of which expires in 2030. Under this water purchase agreement, our customer is obligated to provide the electricity needed to operate our plant at no charge to us. We lease the site where this plant is located. We are required to transfer ownership of the plant to the government of the BVI upon the expiration of the water purchase agreement and upon the termination of the agreement under certain other circumstances. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The government of the BVI has sent us notice that it believes that our acquisition of the capital stock of Biwater (BVI) Holdings Limited required its written consent and that the failure to obtain such consent constitutes a breach of the water purchase agreement between the government of the BVI and Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd.” Peru
 In October 2016, we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Aguas de Bayovar S.A.C., or ADB, and all the rights and obligations under a design and construction contract for a desalination plant and related infrastructure located in Peru (the “Peru Acquisition”).  We sell both seawater and desalinated process water on a take-or-pay basis to Compañia Minera Miski Mayo S.R.L under an operating and maintenance agreement. Compañia Minera Miski Mayo S.R.L uses the water to operate its Bayovar phosphate mine, which is located in North Western Peru. The desalination plant and related infrastructure have the capacity to deliver more than 7.9 million GPD of seawater to the mine via a 24 mile pipeline and 2.7 million GPD of desalinated process water from a SWRO facility located at the mine site. The current term of the operating and maintenance agreement expires in 2037. The plant is constructed on property controlled by Compañia Minera Miski Mayo S.R.L, which owns the plant and related infrastructure. The rights to the design and construction contract include monthly installment payments for the construction of the desalination plant and related infrastructure, which are guaranteed by a major shareholder of our customer and continue until 2024. These payments are accounted for as a note receivable.  Other Plants
 We own and operate a desalination plant with the design capacity of 1.0 million GPD on the Island of Great Exuma, The Bahamas. We acquired the facility in 2009 and refurbished it in 2013. We sell the water produced at this plant on a take‑or‑pay basis to Clearview Enterprises Limited, which is part of the Sandals Group. We also operate and maintain a wastewater treatment plant owned by Sandals Group at the same location. The current term of these agreements expire in 2019. We lease the site where the desalination plant is located from our customer.
 We own and operate two desalination plants with the design capacity of an aggregate of 500,000 GPD on Providenciales, Turks and Caicos Islands. We built one of these plants and acquired and refurbished the other. We sell the water produced at these plants to local customers and own the sites where these plants are located.
 We own and operate a desalination plant with the design capacity of 50,000 GPD in Chile, which began operating in September 2015. We sell the water produced by this plant to one customer.

 Customers
 The customers of our Seven Seas Water platform generally fall into three categories: (i) municipal customers or government‑owned utility companies, (ii) industrial, power, refining, mining and/or other manufacturing companies which require a reliable source of industrial quality water for their operations, or (iii) resorts and/or private entities. These customers may (i) contract with us through our Seven Seas Water platform to either build and operate plants, (ii) become our customers after their initial plant operator seeks to sell its interest in a plant or (iii) after such customer replaces an operator with Seven Seas Water.
 Our important target market opportunities include municipal customers or government‑owned utility companies that wish to contract to have a plant constructed to increase water production for residential or industrial purposes or seek our experience in operating an existing plant. Under these arrangements, the municipal customers or government‑owned utility company is typically responsible for distributing water, providing power and a minimum purchase guarantee.
 Another target market is industrial customers that require clean water for an industrial purpose. Historically, prospective industrial customers generated their own water but increasingly more industrial users have outsourced the production of water to focus on their core competencies.
 For the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues earned from our customers in Trinidad and the BVI represented approximately 12% and 12%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenues. 
 Business Development
 Our Seven Seas Water platform focuses on opportunities to own and operate desalination plants designed to produce 2 million GPD to 13 million GPD of water for governmental, municipal, industrial and hospitality customers, a relatively underserved sub‑segment of the desalination market with limited comparable solutions and competitors. We pursue these opportunities by participating in request for proposal processes, developing plans for plants in underserved areas, acquiring existing plants and providing emergency water services. Geographically, we continue to pursue opportunities to expand in the Caribbean region, while seeking opportunities in North America, South America and other select markets.
 Our business development function is organized into teams dedicated to pursuing opportunities in specific target markets. Company personnel dedicated to North American, the Caribbean and the Middle Eastern markets operate primarily from our Tampa, Florida offices. Our South American team operates from Santiago, Chile, where we have maintained personnel and an office since 2011 which has been focused on developing business opportunities for the Seven Seas Water business in South America. 
 As part of our expansion strategy, we may acquire additional desalination plants. Potential acquisition candidates include individual plants and businesses that operate multiple plants. We frequently evaluate potential acquisition candidates and engage in discussions and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions. There can be no assurance that any of our discussions or negotiations will result in an acquisition. Further, if we make any acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate any acquired plants or businesses profitably or otherwise successfully implement our expansion strategy.
 We also pursue opportunities to increase the amount of water we supply to existing customers. Historically, as we have provided customers with a reliable, cost‑effective clean water supply, our customers experience an increase in demand from the ultimate end users, leading to opportunities for us to expand existing plants and develop new plants. These opportunities also often enable us to extend the terms of our existing water supply agreements and to reduce the unit cost to the customer.
 We also actively identify new markets that need, or could benefit from, a reliable and cost‑effective supply of clean water. Once we have identified a region that would benefit from our WAAS offerings, we work with local partners to identify possible customers with whom we can enter into long‑term supply agreements. In certain situations, this involves responding to requests for proposals from municipal or private sector customers. In other situations, we directly solicit potential customers to pursue a negotiated arrangement.

 We also pursue opportunities to deploy our mobile containerized and modular plants to help parties address water emergencies or crises. To address this business opportunity, we maintain a fleet of mobile containerized plants. Our ability to quickly deploy, commission and commence operation of these plants provides us a competitive advantage in these situations. We provide these rapid deploy services pursuant to contracts that typically have terms of three to five years. By assisting customers to address their emergencies and crises, we are often well positioned to expand our relationship with the customer into a long‑term water supply arrangement.
 Our strategy is to provide water services in areas where the supply of potable water is scarce. We have focused on the Caribbean and adjacent areas as our principal market because these areas have little or no naturally occurring fresh water. We also continue to pursue other regions with similar characteristics.
 Competition
 Seven Seas Water targets projects for medium‑scale plants that it can own and operate that are accompanied by long‑term contracts to sell water to customers. We compete primarily on the basis of the unit price at which water is sold to our customers, as well as our ability to build, commission, operate and maintain our plants to provide customers with a reliable long‑term water supply. Our pricing depends on many factors, including the length of the water supply agreement term, the volume of water to be supplied, factors relating to the feedwater quality and location of the plant, infrastructure availability, electric power availability and costs (including who is responsible for paying those costs), and our cost of capital, among other factors.
 The competitors in our market generally fall into three categories: engineering, procurement and construction, or EPC, companies; large project developers; and other outsourced service model companies. EPC companies, which contract to build plants that satisfy specific requirements, often do not operate such plants after completion. EPC company contracts also generally satisfy the minimum customer water production requirements at the lowest reasonable capital cost which may not prioritize operating cost or reliability. Large project developers focus on large‑scale municipal desalination projects, prefer to take the role as lead developer for a customer sponsor and often do not operate plants after completion. For both of these types of competitors, the customer either assumes the risk and responsibility of operating the plant or engages a third party to do so. We believe that generally none of these competitors focus on building a plant with low operating costs, maximum reliability or excess capacity in anticipation of future water needs.
 Seven Seas Water’s focus on building and operating plants that can adapt to customers’ changing needs has provided it with experience and a long‑term approach that is well aligned with our customers’ interests. Larger global competitors typically focus on larger plants with a capacity of 25 million GPD or greater, selling equipment or building plants instead of making outsourced service model investments. These companies, among others, currently operate in areas in which we would like to expand our operations. These companies already maintain world‑wide operations and have greater financial, managerial and other resources than us. We believe that our low overhead costs, knowledge of local markets and our efficient manner of operating desalination water production equipment will provide us a competitive advantage in many medium‑scale applications and projects.
 Quench
 Our Quench business offers WAAS solutions by providing bottleless filtered water coolers and other products that use filtered water as an input, such as ice machines, sparkling water dispensers and coffee brewers, to customers across the United States. Our POU systems purify a customer’s existing water supply, offering a cost‑effective, convenient, and environmentally‑friendly alternative to traditional bottled water coolers, or BWC. We offer our solutions to a broad mix of industries, including government, education, medical, manufacturing, retail and hospitality, among others, including more than half of the Fortune 500. We install and maintain our filtered water systems in exchange for a monthly rental fee, typically under multi‑year contracts that renew automatically. With an installed base of more than 90,000 company‑owned systems, we believe that we are one of the largest POU‑focused water services companies operating in the United States. We service customers across the United States, with Quench employee service technicians covering more than 250 metropolitan statistical areas, as defined in the 2010 U.S. Census. We generate sales by leveraging our team of field and inside sales representatives, supported by a marketing team with expertise in digital and traditional media. We believe our scale, product breadth and service expertise provide us a competitive advantage. These capabilities also help to create customer loyalty and preserve our market share.

 Products
 Our filtered water systems offer customers a cost‑effective, convenient and environmentally‑friendly alternative to traditional bottled water coolers. Our systems are connected to a customer’s existing water supply, which is filtered at the point of use to reduce impurities and other contaminants. Once a Quench system is installed, ongoing service requirements, including routine maintenance, repair and filter changes, are typically covered under a monthly rental agreement.
 We offer our customers filtered water systems with varying capacities to serve low, medium and high usage environments, which are available in floor‑standing, countertop, under‑counter and under‑sink model forms. Our systems offer a variety of water dispensing options, including hot, cold, ambient and sparkling water. These systems are also available with various features, such as hands‑free dispensing, anti‑microbial surfaces and leak detection. Depending on the customer’s purification requirements, Quench systems can employ various technologies such as carbon filtration, reverse osmosis filtration, deionization and ultraviolet sanitization.
 In addition, we offer a line of ice machines and commercial coffee brewers, both of which utilize our water filtration systems. To our coffee brewer customers, we also offer a selection of coffees, teas and other break room supplies. We also provide systems that deliver high‑purity water for industrial processes.
 We purchase our filtered water systems from a variety of manufacturers, both in the United States and overseas. We also refurbish equipment that is returned from customer locations for future redeployment. We purchase nearly all of our equipment from three vendors; however, we believe that this equipment could be sourced from alternate vendors if necessary or advantageous.
 We provide our services generally under automatically‑renewing rental contracts with initial terms ranging from month‑to‑month to five years. Our annual unit attrition rate, at December 31, 2016, was approximately 8%, implying an average rental period of more than 11 years. We bear the up‑front cost of purchasing and installing systems as well as the ongoing cost of maintaining them in exchange for a recurring fee. In certain circumstances, we sell water filtration systems to customers, which may be accompanied by a maintenance contract. We also service equipment on a time‑and‑materials basis for certain customers.
 Sales and Marketing
 We market our products through a variety of digital and traditional methods. Digital marketing activities include search engine marketing, email marketing, affiliate marketing and display advertising. Traditional marketing activities include telemarketing and trade shows. Marketing messages emphasize the benefits of water filtration versus those of delivered water, which include convenience, reliability of supply, cost savings, wellness and environmental sustainability. In 2015, POU system penetration was 11.1% of the U.S. commercial water cooler market, by revenue, which we believe provides a significant opportunity for additional organic growth.
 We have a team of Quench sales and marketing professionals dedicated to new customer acquisition activities across the United States. Our field sales representatives are focused on increasing penetration in the largest metropolitan markets nationwide. We also have specialized sales teams focused on large enterprises and specific industries to expand our market penetration. We maintain a presence in online advertising and lead generation, supported by an in‑house team of digital marketing personnel.
 Our Quench platform is also well‑positioned to increase sales to existing customers. In addition to our sales team, our customer care representatives generate revenue by selling additional products to existing customers. Additionally, as we service our equipment, we routinely identify opportunities to reassess our customer’s needs and offer additional services and system upgrades. Frequently, Quench customers will add systems during the course of their relationship with Quench.
 We intend to continue to differentiate our offering to customers by adding innovative new water filtration products and related water‑enabled products. We also intend to grow the geographic footprint of our high‑purity industrial applications business and are considering future international and residential market expansion in our POU business.

 Customers
 We target businesses across the United States with an emphasis on companies with 20 or more employees, as well as those operating in several key industries, such as government, education, medical, retail and hospitality. We maintain a highly diversified customer base of approximately 40,000 customers. Customer Service
 Our service technicians are trained to service our POU systems to ensure a convenient, reliable water supply. In larger metropolitan areas across the United States, we service equipment via local employee service technicians, who perform installations, preventive maintenance and repairs. In areas without local employees, Quench technicians travel to handle installations and preventive maintenance. When necessary, Quench engages third‑party contractors for certain types of service calls. Competition
 We compete directly with other POU filtration, BWC, and office coffee service, or OCS, companies, as well as with retail stores and internet sites where similar products and services may be purchased. Municipal tap water is also a substitute for our POU filtration services. The POU filtration market is highly fragmented, with many small, local service providers. There are also a number of larger national competitors, including DS Services (a subsidiary of Cott Corporation), which offers BWC, OCS and POU services; Nestle, which offers BWC and POU services; Aramark, Compass Water Solutions, Waterlogic International and Pure Health Solutions, Inc. which offer OCS and POU services; and OneSource Water, which was acquired by Waterlogic International in October 2016 and is a primary competitor in POU services. Our competitive position is based on our pricing, national service coverage and product quality.
 The POU segment we serve accounts for 11.1% by revenue of the $4.2 billion per year U.S. commercial water cooler market. Though relatively small, the number of POU units has been growing consistently and is projected to continue to grow at the expense of BWCs. We believe POU systems offer an attractive alternative to BWCs primarily due to cost, convenience, health benefits and environmental considerations. In 2015, approximately 29% of all new POU accounts (commercial and residential) in the United States were attributed to BWC conversions. We believe that the quality and reliability of our service, both in the field and in the back office, are differentiators within our markets.
 Market Opportunity
 We primarily operate in two water sectors—desalination and commercial water filtration. We believe both sectors offer us opportunities for significant organic and inorganic growth due to their size, positive long‑term growth trends and fragmentation.
 A number of key macroeconomic factors shape the global water sector, including population growth, an increasing water supply‑demand imbalance, urbanization, industrialization, and consumers’ heightened health and environmental awareness. Global water demand has outpaced population growth, leading to chronic water scarcity in many regions around the world. According to data from the United Nations, global water demand (excluding irrigation) will grow three times faster than the global population. Further, the 2030 Water Resources Group, a consortium of non‑governmental development organizations and the private sector, estimates that global water demand will exceed supply by 40% by 2030. The United Nations Environment Programme, an agency of the United Nations that coordinates environmental programs, estimates that roughly half of the world’s population currently lives within 40 miles of the sea. Because of the proximity of population centers to saltwater bodies, we believe desalination is a viable solution to address future water shortages.
 As clean water demand continues to grow, we believe the need for water treatment technologies, such as desalination and POU filtration, will increase, and we believe both of our operating platforms are well positioned to benefit from these trends.
 Global Desalination Market
 In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the installation of new seawater desalination capacity. According to a 2016 report by Global Water Intelligence (GWI), global online capacity reached approximately 20 billion

GPD in 2015 and total contracted desalination capacity is expected to grow at a 6% compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) over the next ten years. The GWI report further indicates that approximately 29% of the desalination capacity globally is currently produced by medium‑scale plants, which is our target market. Many of the existing medium‑scale plants are owned and operated by local governments and companies, and operating desalination facilities is generally not their core competency. As a result, we believe a large number of these plants could benefit from our ownership and operating expertise to generate more reliable and lower‑cost clean water.
 According to the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct rankings, the Caribbean is one of the most water‑scarce regions of the world in terms of fresh water availability, comparable to the Western Sahara and parts of the Middle East. We believe our Seven Seas Water platform is a leading desalination solution provider in the Caribbean, where we operate nine water treatment facilities. Our installed capacity in the Caribbean has grown from 9.2 million GPD in 2010 to 29.4 million GPD as of December 31, 2016. Based on information published by GWI, we estimate that during the period from our inception in 2007 through 2015, our plants represented approximately 28% of all plant capacity coming online in the Caribbean and one‑third of the region’s existing medium‑scale desalination plant capacity. Many of the Caribbean region’s current desalination facilities utilize older thermal technologies that are more costly to operate than membrane‑based SWRO systems. We believe replacing these thermal plants with new SWRO plants is a significant additional opportunity for us. Given our compelling value proposition, extensive presence, and operational expertise in SWRO plants, we believe we are well positioned to further grow our Caribbean business.
 We currently have a presence or targeted business development activities primarily in the Caribbean, South America, the Middle East and North America. The total installed capacity of medium‑scale desalination plants in these locations is more than 2 billion GPD. We target specific attractive end markets, such as the municipal drinking water, mining, oil and gas, and ultra‑pure industrial process water markets, in both large and mature markets in North America and the Middle East, as well as in fast‑growing developing markets in South America and the Caribbean. We believe we are well positioned to pursue opportunities in these markets through new project development, partnerships with local firms and strategic acquisitions.
 U.S. Water Cooler Market
 A 2016 study by Zenith International, or Zenith, estimates that the U.S. water cooler market will generate $4.2 billion of revenues in 2015, on an install base of more than 5.8 million BWC and POU units. POU units represent $467 million of these revenues and 1.4 million of the installed units, of which 94% are within the commercial market segment, which we target. We believe that POU units are taking market share from BWC units for a variety of reasons, including cost, convenience, health benefits and environmental concerns. Zenith reports that in the U.S., the average BWC customer will spend $50.85 per month for bottles (5.01 bottles per month at an average price of $10.15 each) plus $19.80 per month to rent the base unit, implying an average total monthly spend of $70.65 per BWC unit. This compares with Zenith’s estimated average monthly rental rate for a POU unit in the U.S. of $35.15. Zenith indicates that from 2010 to 2015, the market share of POU on an installed unit basis grew from 16.4% to 23.5%, which represents a unit CAGR of 10% for that period. Zenith expects the total number of POU units to grow at a CAGR of approximately 9% between 2015‑2020, while the number of total installed BWC units is projected to grow at a CAGR of only 1% during the same period.
 We estimate that our market share is approximately 6.5% of commercial POU systems on an installed unit basis. The U.S. POU water cooler market is highly fragmented with hundreds of small regional providers, representing an opportunity for consolidation. Given the size of our addressable market and the fragmentation of the industry, we believe we are well positioned to realize growth with our focus on the commercial POU market.

 Excellence in Execution Driven by Engineering and Operational Expertise
 Our experience in implementing, operating and servicing water filtration technologies is at the core of our water solutions. Our expertise drives our ability to offer customized solutions to satisfy our customers’ water needs.
 Our engineering experience and expertise is critical in developing Seven Seas Water desalination solutions that meet each customer’s specific water quality standards and quantity needs adapted to local conditions, including different feedwater sources. Another important aspect of engineering expertise is reliability, as evidenced by our ability to achieve an average plant uptime of approximately 97% since 2013, which provides our customers an uninterrupted water supply. Furthermore, our prefabricated containers and modular equipment are specially designed for quick deployment and maximum flexibility to adjust output capacities, allowing us to react quickly to customer emergencies or changes in demand.
 Our Quench POU filtered water systems utilize a variety of water purification technologies, including reverse osmosis, carbon filtration, deionization and ultraviolet sanitization. Our service technicians are trained to maintain and service our POU systems to provide a convenient, reliable and high quality water supply.
 Experienced Management Team with Demonstrated Track Record
 Our management team, led by Chief Executive Officer Douglas R. Brown, President Anthony Ibarguen and Chief Financial Officer Lee S. Muller, has extensive industry experience. This team has a demonstrated track record of managing costs, adapting to changing market conditions, developing a comprehensive safety culture and financing, acquiring, integrating and operating new businesses and water plants.
 Our Seven Seas Water team currently operates our ten water treatment facilities and previously designed and operated more than 50 desalination plants with Ionics, Incorporated. Their significant expertise has been instrumental in creating customized and highly reliable desalination solutions even in demanding water applications.
 Our Quench team also has a demonstrated track record of expanding the Quench platform by adding new customers, retaining existing customers, and acquiring and integrating numerous POU filtered water service providers into its platform.
 Strong Competitive Position Supported by Long‑Term Customer Relationships
 We have long‑standing customer relationships. In our experience, customers typically extend their contracts significantly beyond the original term, as the need for a clean, reliable water supply continues and the customer realizes the value proposition of our WAAS business model. Furthermore, we believe our operating and engineering expertise, experienced management team, and scale put us at the forefront of our industry, and that significant investment would be required for others to replicate our platforms.
 Our water supply agreements under our Seven Seas Water platform typically provide for initial terms of up to 20 years and typically contain contractual provisions for cost pass‑through and minimum volume requirements. In addition, we have a reputation for quality and customer service. We have a track record of expanding and extending our initial contracts into longer‑term agreements with increasing water purchase volumes, in part, because we provide our customers with a cost‑effective and reliable water solution.
 A study by Zenith International named our Quench platform as one of the top five companies in the POU industry based on the number of POU units rented or sold. Our current typical initial contract term is three years with an automatic renewal provision, and our annual unit attrition rate, at December 31, 2016, was approximately 8%, implying an average rental period of more than 11 years, in part, because we provide highly reliable and efficient services. We believe our scale, product breadth and reliability, and customer service are key differentiators in a highly fragmented industry primarily composed of smaller providers.
 Significant Experience Identifying and Integrating Acquisitions
 Identifying and executing value‑enhancing acquisitions are core to our growth strategy. Under our Seven Seas Water platform, we have acquired five operating desalination facilities, which had an aggregate capacity of 9.8 million 

 
  13

 
GPD at the time of acquisition. Quench has also completed eleven acquisitions since 2008, three of which occurred after our acquisition of Quench in June 2014, significantly expanding our installed base. We routinely evaluate opportunities for acquisitions and believe our experience and success in identifying, executing, integrating and operating acquisitions enable us to deploy capital effectively, create shareholder value and increase our market share.
 Strong Financial Performance
 We have demonstrated sustained revenue growth with attractive margins under long‑term customer relationships.
 Our revenues grew at a CAGR of 41.6% from 2011 to 2016. We believe we can continue our revenue growth by acquiring customers, expanding our relationships with our customers, expanding into new geographies and complementary services, and selectively acquiring related water services businesses.
 Our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $20.5 million, $41.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our Adjusted EBITDA was $36.0 million, $27.3 million and $18.8 million, respectively. See “—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Reconciliation of Non‑GAAP Financial Data” for a reconciliation of our GAAP net loss to Adjusted EBITDA. We credit the achievement of our Adjusted EBITDA margins (Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue) to our strong customer value proposition and our operating efficiency. In addition, cash collected (including principal and interest) on the design and construction contract (which is accounted for as a note receivable) we acquired in the Peru Acquisition totaled $1.4 million. We believe we have significant opportunities to continue to improve our margins as we further increase our scale and operating leverage.
 Our Strategy
 Continue to be an Industry Leader in Quality, Service and Efficiency
 We will continue to focus on servicing our customers and responding to changing customer needs and emergency situations in the water industry. Our WAAS business model helps us to control reliability and quality and ensure compliance with health standards and customer specifications. Our Seven Seas Water desalination plants operate safely and efficiently with an average uptime of approximately 97% since 2013, providing an uninterrupted supply of water for our customers. Our Quench platform benefits from significant economies of scale that are expected to continue as the business grows. Drive Sustainable and Profitable Growth
 We are focused on long‑term, sustainable equity returns and intend to continue to deploy capital in attractive return opportunities. Across both our Seven Seas Water and our Quench platforms, we have recurring revenue that is derived from predictable and contractually‑obligated payments. In addition, our Seven Seas Water margins often benefit from contractual inflation‑protection and cost pass‑through provisions.
 We believe our differentiated WAAS business model results in attractive unit economics. As a result, we expect our growth will further enhance operating leverage and drive margin expansion for both the Seven Seas Water and Quench platforms. 
 Develop New Business Opportunities and Add New Customers for Growth
 We intend to continue to develop new business opportunities and add new customers supported by our experienced sales and marketing teams. Our Seven Seas Water platform has a dedicated business development team focusing on new project development opportunities globally. We strategically focus on providing municipal drinking water, wastewater recovery and industrial process water systems in the Middle East, South America and new territories in the Caribbean. We also intend to expand our Seven Seas Water platform to U.S. areas, such as Texas, that are characterized by both a high concentration of process industry and water scarcity.
 Quench has an experienced and growing team of sales and marketing professionals responsible for new customer acquisition and expansion of existing customer relationships. Our sales representatives leverage our innovative, 

 
  14

 
internet‑focused marketing and lead generation platform to add new customers. We also have dedicated sales teams targeting certain industries, such as government, education and medical, as well as large enterprise opportunities.
 Drive Growth through Increased Sales to Current Customers
 Both our Seven Seas Water and Quench platforms are well positioned to realize growth through incremental sales to current customers due to our longstanding relationships developed as a result of our reliable operating performance, competitive pricing and highly‑rated customer service.
 Our Seven Seas Water platform has a track record of increasing sales to current customers.
 Seven Seas Water maintains a fleet of containerized and modular plants for rapid deployment and commissioning. This gives us a competitive advantage when responding to short‑term water emergencies. Once these emergency systems are operating, we have the opportunity to demonstrate the high reliability our water plants have achieved elsewhere. We have had significant success converting these short‑term customer relationships into much longer (10 to 20 years) contractual agreements. 
 Within our Quench platform, our existing customers continue to provide significant opportunities for us to offer additional products and services. Many of our customers add water coolers or upgrade them during their relationship with us, and many also opt to rent equipment from our newer product lines enabled by POU water filtration, such as ice machines, sparkling water coolers and coffee brewers.
 Continued Development of New Product Offerings to Open New Market Opportunities
 We intend to pursue new market opportunities and customers with our Seven Seas Water platform by leveraging our emergency response capabilities and specialized water supply systems for large‑scale industrial operations such as mining, power generation and high water consumption manufacturing activities. We invest in containerized and modular water plants to enable us to provide rapid water supply solutions for customers who require water desalination solutions quickly, including in emergency situations. We are also actively examining and pursuing governmental, municipal, industrial and hospitality wastewater recovery opportunities as well as opportunities to treat produced water, which is generated through oil and gas exploration.
 In our Quench business, we intend to continue working with our suppliers and leveraging our market knowledge, to refine our water cooler product offerings and our other related water‑enabled products, such as ice machines, sparkling water systems and coffee brewers.
 Selectively Pursue Acquisitions
 Acquisitions have historically been a major growth driver for us, and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions in the future.
 We intend to continue to selectively purchase, upgrade, expand and operate existing water treatment and desalination facilities in new and current markets under our Seven Seas Water platform. Our strategy includes proactive deal sourcing where we identify and pursue the acquisition of assets or businesses from companies which own and operate a single desalination facility. We can often operate these facilities more efficiently and reliably than current operators by leveraging our engineering and operating expertise.
 We believe the highly fragmented nature of the POU filtered water market will allow Quench to continue to identify and acquire POU companies to increase penetration of our current markets, broaden our product offerings and expand geographically.
 In September 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of ADB and all of the rights and obligations under a design and construction contract for a desalination plant and related infrastructure located in Peru. On October 31, 2016, we completed this transaction for an aggregate purchase price of $46.5 million in cash, which was funded using a portion of the proceeds from our IPO.
 While we routinely identify and evaluate potential acquisition candidates and engage in discussions and 

 
  15

 
negotiations regarding potential acquisitions, there can be no assurance that any of our discussions or negotiations will result in an acquisition. Further, if we make any acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate or integrate any acquired businesses profitably or otherwise successfully implement our expansion strategy.
