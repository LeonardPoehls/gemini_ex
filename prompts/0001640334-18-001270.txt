General Overview
 
Our company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 24, 2012. Founded in Calgary, Canada, we were formed and organized to capitalize on new opportunities found in the North American market for light-emitting diode (“LED”) lighting. With China as the manufacturing backbone of future LED products, we have set up an office in Guangzhou, China in search of high quality products offered by reputable manufacturers to be introduced to Canada, the United States, and abroad. In November 2016, we expanded our operations to include reselling various energy products and green technology products. We achieved this by acquiring Energy Alliance Labs Inc. (“Energy Alliance”), which is the 80% owner of Human Energy Alliance Laboratories Corp., an Idaho corporation (“HEAL”). HEAL is a “green technology” and retail company with the mission of developing and distributing technologies that relieve its customers of certain burdens, while simultaneously decreasing the energy they use. HEAL’s primary products are mid-sized wind turbines, small solar panels and related controllers and inverters.
 
On October 28, 2016, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Liao Zu Guo, a director of our company, whereby on the same date we issued 80,000 shares of our common stock in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Energy Alliance.
 
On November 1, 2016, Energy Alliance closed the transactions contemplated under an agreement with certain shareholders of HEAL, in which the shareholders holding 80% of the outstanding equity interests of HEAL sold all of their shares of HEAL to Energy Alliance.
 
As a result of such transactions we became the owner of 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Energy Alliance and Energy Alliance became the owner of 80% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of HEAL.
 
Effective October 4, 2016, we filed a Certificate of Dissolution of MJP Holdings Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary.

Effective November 28, 2016, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with MJP Lighting Solutions Ltd., a British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) corporation and Tong Tang and Zhao Hui Ma (the “Shareholders”) whereby the parties exchanged 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of BVI, belonging to our company for the tender of 5,500,000 restricted common shares of our company, belonging to the Shareholders, to our treasury for cancellation.
 
On January 1, 2017, MJP entered into transfer agreement with Liao Zu Guo, whereby we transferred 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Energy Alliance for consideration of $20,000 for past services provided to our company by Mr. Guo.
 
On December 1, 2017, a majority of our stockholders and our board of directors approved a change of name of our company to “Bionovate Technologies Corp.” and a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a fifty (50) old for one (1) new basis.
 
A Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on December 11, 2017 with an effective date of December 21, 2017.
 
The name change and reverse split will become effective with the OTC Markets at the opening of trading on December 21, 2017 under the symbol “MJPID”. The "D" will be placed on our ticker symbol for 20 business days. Our new CUSIP number is 09074V103.
 
We do not have any subsidiaries.
 
We have not been subject to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.
 
Our Current Business
 
We are currently seeking new business opportunities with established business entities for merger with or acquisition of a target business. In certain instances, a target business may wish to become our subsidiary or may wish to contribute assets to us rather than merge. We have not yet begun negotiations or entered into any definitive agreements for potential new business opportunities, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any definitive agreements.
 
Any new acquisition or business opportunities that we may acquire will require additional financing. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to acquire the financing necessary to enable us to pursue our plan of operation. If our company requires additional financing and we are unable to acquire such funds, our business may fail.
 
Management of our company believes that there are benefits to being a reporting company with a class of securities quoted on the OTCQB, such as: (i) the ability to use registered securities to acquire assets or businesses; (ii) increased visibility in the financial community; (iii) the facilitation of borrowing from financial institutions; (iv) potentially improved trading efficiency; (v) potential stockholder liquidity; (vi) potentially greater ease in raising capital subsequent to an acquisition; (vii) potential compensation of key employees through stock awards or options; (viii) potentially enhanced corporate image; and (ix) a presence in the United States’ capital market.
 
We may seek a business opportunity with entities that have recently commenced operations, or entities who wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand business development activities, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. We may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries.
 
In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition or opportunity, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon the consummation of a transaction, it is likely that our present management will no longer retain a majority control of our company. In addition, it is likely that as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, one or more new officers and directors, would join our company.

As of the date hereof, we have not entered into any formal written agreements for a business combination or opportunity. When any such agreement is reached, we intend to disclose such an agreement by filing a current report on Form 8-K. 
 
We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and without certainty of success. Business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of our company may be scarce, or we may be unable to obtain the ones that we want. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities.
 
Currently, we do not have a source of revenue. We are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations. We have been reliant on loans by affiliated and non-affiliated parties to provide financial contributions and services to keep our company operating. Further, we believe that our company may have difficulties raising capital from other sources until we locate a prospective merger candidate through which we can pursue our plan of operation. If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our acquisition efforts, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail. We currently have no written or oral agreement from our majority shareholder to continue to provide financial contributions.
 
Employees
 
We have no employees. Our officers and directors furnish their time to the development of our company at no cost.
