Item 1. | Business

Overview
William Lyon Homes, a Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries, is one of the largest Western U.S. regional homebuilders. Headquartered in Newport Beach, California, the Company is primarily engaged in the design, construction, marketing and sale of single-family detached and attached homes in California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Washington and Oregon. The Company's core markets currently include Orange County, Los Angeles, the Inland Empire, the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Denver, Seattle and Portland. The Company has a distinguished legacy of more than 60 years of homebuilding operations, over which time it has sold in excess of 99,000 homes. The Company believes that its markets are characterized by attractive long-term housing fundamentals and that it has a significant land supply, with 17,858 lots owned or controlled.
The Company has significant expertise in understanding the needs of its homebuyers and designing its product offerings to meet those needs. This allows the Company to maximize the return on its land investments by tailoring its home offerings to meet the buyer demands in each of its markets. The Company builds and sells across a diverse range of product lines at a variety of price points with sales to entry-level, first-time move-up and second-time move-up homebuyers, as well as a signature luxury brand. The Company is committed to achieving the highest standards in design, quality and customer satisfaction and has received numerous industry awards and commendations throughout its operating history in recognition of its achievements. 
In 2016, the Company delivered 2,781 homes, with an average selling price of approximately $504,200, and recognized home sales revenues of $1.4 billion. As of December 31, 2016, the Company was selling homes in 81 communities and had a consolidated backlog of 733 sold but unclosed homes, with an associated sales value of $410.7 million, representing a 5% increase in value as compared to its backlog as of December 31, 2015. The average selling price of homes in backlog as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $560,300, which was approximately 11% higher than the average selling price of homes closed for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
Through the strategic acquisition of the residential homebuilding business of Polygon Northwest, or the Polygon Acquisition, in August 2014, the Company expanded its geographic footprint and increased the scale of its existing operations within the Western U.S. region, acquiring a company that not only has demonstrated impressive operating results but that also is complementary in terms of product offering and cultural fit, with a similar strong reputation for high customer satisfaction and new home quality. The Company believes that Polygon Northwest was the largest private homebuilder in the Pacific Northwest region at the time of the acquisition, with #2 market positions in each of its core markets of Seattle and Portland. At the time of the acquisition, Polygon Northwest had operated in the Pacific Northwest region for over 20 years, delivering approximately 16,000 homes during such time period. 
Initial Public Offering and Common Stock Recapitalization
On May 21, 2013, the Company completed its initial public offering of 10,005,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, which consisted of 7,177,500 shares sold by the Company and 2,827,500 shares sold by the selling stockholder. The Company raised total net proceeds of approximately $163.7 million in the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholder.
The Company’s authorized capital stock now consists of 190,000,000 shares, 150,000,000 of which are designated as Class A Common Stock with a par value of $0.01 per share, or the Class A Common Stock, 30,000,000 of which are designated as Class B Common Stock with a par value of $0.01 per share, or the Class B Common Stock, and 10,000,000 of which are designated as preferred stock with a par value of $0.01 per share.
In connection with the initial public offering, the Company completed a common stock recapitalization, or the Common Stock Recapitalization, which included a 1-for-8.25 reverse stock split of its Class A Common Stock, or the Class A Reverse Split, the conversion of all the outstanding shares of Parent’s previously outstanding Class C Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, or the Class C Common Stock, previously outstanding Class D Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, or the Class D Common Stock, and previously outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, or the Convertible Preferred Stock, into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis and as automatically adjusted for the Class A Reverse Split, and a 1-for-8.25 reverse stock split of its Class B Common Stock. The effect of the reverse stock split was retroactively applied to the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012, the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period from February 25, 2012 through December 31, 2012, and the Consolidated Statements of Equity, presented herein. Unless otherwise specified, all other information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K gives effect to the Common Stock

Recapitalization. Upon completion of the initial public offering, Parent had 27,146,036 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding, excluding shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and restricted shares that had been granted but were unvested, and 3,813,884 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding, excluding shares underlying a warrant to purchase 1,907,550 additional shares of Class B Common Stock. The warrant was amended in May 2013 to extend the term from five years to ten years, and the warrant will now expire on February 24, 2022. The change to the warrant had no corresponding impact on the financial statements.
Chapter 11 Reorganization
On December 19, 2011, Parent and certain of its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions, or the Chapter 11 Petitions, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, or the Bankruptcy Court, to seek approval of the Prepackaged Joint Plan of Reorganization, or the Plan, of Parent and certain of its subsidiaries. The sole purpose of the Chapter 11 cases was to restructure the debt obligations and strengthen the balance sheet of Parent and certain of its subsidiaries.
On February 10, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan, and on February 25, 2012, Parent and its subsidiaries consummated the principal transactions contemplated by the Plan, including:

• | the issuance of 5,429,485 shares of Parent’s new Class A Common Stock, and $75 million aggregate principal amount of 12% Senior Subordinated Secured Notes due 2017, or the 12% Notes, issued by Parent’s wholly-owned subsidiary, William Lyon Homes, Inc., or California Lyon, in exchange for the claims held by the holders of an aggregate outstanding amount of $299.1 million of the formerly outstanding notes of California Lyon (neither Parent nor California Lyon received any net proceeds from the issuance of the 12% Notes), which 12% Notes were subsequently paid off in full during 2012;


• | the amendment of California Lyon’s term loan agreement with certain lenders, or the Amended Term Loan, which resulted, among other things, in the increase in the principal amount outstanding under the loan agreement from $206 million to $235 million, the reduction in the interest rate payable under the loan agreement, and the elimination of any prepayment penalty under the loan agreement, and which Term Loan Agreement was subsequently paid off in full during 2012;


• | the issuance, in exchange for cash and land deposits of $25 million, of 3,813,884 shares of Parent’s new Class B Common Stock, and a warrant to purchase 1,907,551 shares of Class B Common Stock; and


• | the issuance of 7,858,404 shares of Parent’s new Convertible Preferred Stock, and 1,952,772 shares of Parent’s new Class C Common Stock in exchange for aggregate cash consideration of $60 million as well as payment for certain transaction fees.

As referenced above, the Class C Common Stock and the Convertible Preferred Stock were subsequently converted into Class A Common Stock in connection with the Common Stock Recapitalization. 
The Company’s Markets
The Company is currently operating in six reportable operating segments: California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Washington and Oregon. Each of the segments has responsibility for the management of the Company’s homebuilding and development operations within its geographic boundaries. See Note 5 to the financial statements for further information.
The following table sets forth homebuilding revenue from each of the Company’s homebuilding segments for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 (in thousands):

Strategy and Lot Position
The Company owned approximately 13,626 lots and had options to purchase an additional 4,232 lots as of December 31, 2016. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “entitled” land typically has a development agreement and/or vesting tentative map, or a final recorded plat or map from the appropriate county or city government. Development agreements and vesting tentative maps generally provide for the right to develop the land in accordance with the provisions of the development agreement or vesting tentative map unless an issue arises concerning health, safety or general welfare. The Company’s sources of developed lots for its homebuilding operations are (1) purchase of smaller projects with shorter life cycles (merchant homebuilding) and (2) development of larger scale projects and/or master-planned communities.
The Company intends to continue to utilize its current inventory of lots and future land acquisitions to conduct its operating strategy, which consists of:

1. | converting our lot supply into active projects;


2. | maximizing revenue in markets with strong demand;


3. | maintaining a low cost structure;


4. | acquiring land positions through disciplined acquisition strategies near employment centers or transportation corridors;


5. | leveraging an experienced management team;


6. | deleveraging the balance sheet; and


7. | generating returns for shareholders and generating positive cash flows.

Land Acquisition and Development
To manage the risks associated with land ownership and development, the Company has a Corporate Land Committee, which is comprised of certain members of its senior executive management team and key operational and financial executives. As potential land acquisitions are being analyzed, the Corporate Land Committee must approve all purchases. Further, the Company's board of directors must also approve land purchases over certain dollar thresholds. The Company’s long-term strategy consists of the following elements:

• | completing due diligence prior to committing to acquire land;


• | reviewing the status of entitlements and other governmental processing to mitigate zoning and other entitlement or development risk;


• | focusing on land as a component of a home’s cost structure, rather than on the land’s speculative value;


• | limiting land acquisition size to reduce investment levels in any one project where possible;


• | utilizing option, joint venture and other non-capital intensive structures to control land and reduce risk where feasible;


• | funding land acquisitions whenever possible with non-recourse seller financing;


• | employing centralized control of approval over all land transactions;


• | diversifying with respect to market segments and product types; and


• | maximizing the number of units/lots per acre to maximize revenue.

Prior to committing to the acquisition of land, the Company conducts feasibility studies covering pertinent aspects of the proposed commitment. These studies may include a variety of elements from technical aspects such as title, zoning, soil and seismic characteristics, to marketing studies that review population and employment trends, schools, transportation access, buyer profiles, sales forecasts, projected profitability, cash requirements, and assessment of political risk and other factors. Prior to acquiring land, the Company considers assumptions concerning the needs of the targeted customer and determines whether the underlying land price enables the Company to meet those needs at an affordable price. Before purchasing land, the Company attempts to project the commencement of construction and sales over a reasonable time period. The Company utilizes architects and outside consultants, under close supervision, to help review acquisitions and design products.
Homebuilding and Market Strategy
The Company currently has a wide variety of product lines which enables it to meet the specific needs of each of its markets. The Company creates product for the entry-level, first time move-up, second time move-up, and luxury home markets, and believes that a diversified product strategy enables it to best serve a wide range of buyers and adapt quickly to a variety of market conditions. The Company’s developments are geographically dispersed in order to diversify market risk.
Because the decision as to which product to develop is based on the Company’s assessment of market conditions and the restrictions imposed by government regulations, home styles and sizes vary from project to project. The Company generally standardizes and limits the number of home designs within any given product line. This standardization permits on-site mass production techniques and bulk purchasing of materials and components, thus enabling the Company to better control and sometimes reduce construction costs and home construction cycles.
The Company contracts with a number of architects and other consultants who are involved in the design process of the Company’s homes. Designs are constrained by zoning requirements, building codes, energy efficiency laws and local architectural guidelines, among other factors. Engineering, landscaping, master-planning and environmental impact analysis work are subcontracted to independent firms which are familiar with local requirements.
Substantially all construction work is done by subcontractors with the Company acting as the general contractor. The Company manages subcontractor activities with on-site supervisory employees and management control systems. The Company does not have long-term contractual commitments with its subcontractors or suppliers, and instead it contracts development work by project and where possible by phase size of 10 to 25 home sites or by buildings for attached product. The Company generally has been able to obtain sufficient materials and subcontractors during times of material shortages, though it has experienced skilled labor shortages in certain markets during times of peak demand. The Company believes its relationships with its suppliers and subcontractors are in good standing.

(1) | The estimated number of homes to be built at completion is approximate and includes home sites in our backlog. Such estimated amounts are subject to change based on, among other things, future site planning, as well as zoning and permit changes, and there can be no assurance that the Company will build these homes. Further, certain projects may include lots that the Company controls, and that are also reflected in "Future Owned and Controlled." 


(2) | “Cumulative Homes Closed” represents homes closed since the project opened, and may include prior years, in addition to the homes closed during the current year presented.


(3) | Backlog consists of homes sold under sales contracts that have not yet closed, and there can be no assurance that closings of sold homes will occur.


(4) | Of the total homes subject to pending sales contracts as of December 31, 2016, 658 represent homes that are completed or under construction.


(5) | Lots owned as of December 31, 2016 include lots in backlog at December 31, 2016.


(6) | Estimated sales price range reflects the most recent pricing updates of the base price only and excludes any lot premium, buyer incentive and buyer selected options, which vary from project to project. Sales prices reflect current pricing estimates and might not be indicative of past or future pricing. Further, any potential benefit to be gained from an increase in sales price ranges as compared to previously estimated amounts may be offset by increases in costs, profit participation, and other factors. 


(7) | Project is a joint venture and is consolidated as a VIE in accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation.


(8) | Project is completely sold out, therefore the sales price range is not applicable as of December 31, 2016.


(9) | Includes projects with lots owned as of December 31, 2016 that are expected to open for sale and have an estimated year of first delivery of 2017 or later, as well as lots controlled as of December 31, 2016, and parcels of undeveloped land held for future sale. Certain lots controlled are under land banking arrangements which may become owned and produce deliveries during 2017. Actual homes at completion may change prior to the marketing and sales of homes in these projects and the sales price ranges for these projects are to be determined and will be based on current market conditions and other factors upon the commencement of active selling. There can be no assurance that the Company will acquire any of the controlled lots reflected in these amounts. 


(10) | Includes parcels of undeveloped land held for future sale. It is unknown when the Company plans to develop homes on this land.


(11) | Project on hold as of December 31, 2016, therefore the sales price range is not applicable.

Sales and Marketing
Each division's management team develops a sales and marketing strategy for each project, which includes:
•recurring market studies of existing home sales as well as competition to establish pricing;
•developing the advertising program based on the product segmentation; and
•understanding the buyer profile to target marketing efforts.
The Company makes use of advertising and other promotional activities, including on-line and social media, brochures, and the placement of strategically located sign boards in the immediate areas of its developments. In addition, the Company markets all of its products through the internet via email lists and interest lists, as well as its website at www.lyonhomes.com. In general, the Company’s advertising emphasizes each project’s strengths, the quality and value of its products and its reputation in the marketplace.
The Company normally builds, decorates, furnishes and landscapes three to five model homes for each product line and maintains on-site sales offices, which typically are open seven days a week, however, in some cases the Company will operate out of an on-site sales trailer prior to model home construction. Management believes that model homes and sales trailers play a particularly important role in the Company’s marketing efforts. Consequently, the Company expends a significant amount of effort in creating an attractive atmosphere at its model homes. Interior decorations vary among the Company’s models and are carefully selected based upon the lifestyles of targeted buyers. Structural changes in design from the model homes are not generally permitted, but home buyers may select various other optional construction and design amenities.
13

The Company employs in-house commissioned sales personnel to sell its homes, and outside brokers are also involved in the selling of the Company’s homes. The Company typically engages its sales personnel on a long-term, rather than a project-by-project basis, which it believes results in a more motivated sales force with an extensive knowledge of the Company’s operating policies and products. Sales personnel are trained by the Company and attend regular meetings to be updated on the availability of financing, construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans.
The Company strives to provide a high level of customer service during the sales process and after a home is sold. The participation of the sales representatives, on-site construction supervisors and the post-closing customer service personnel, working in a team effort, is intended to foster the Company’s reputation for quality and service, and ultimately lead to enhanced customer retention and referrals.
The Company’s homes are typically sold before or during construction through sales contracts which are usually accompanied by a small cash deposit. Such sales contracts are usually subject to certain contingencies such as the buyer’s ability to qualify for financing. The cancellation rate of buyers who contracted to buy a home but did not close escrow at the Company and its joint ventures’ projects was approximately 16% during 2016 and 20% during 2015. Cancellations are caused by a variety of factors beyond the Company’s control such as buyer discretion, individual customer circumstances and current economic conditions.
Warranty
The Company provides its homebuyers with a one to three year limited warranty, depending upon the timing of close of escrow and location of the project, covering workmanship and materials. The Company also provides its homebuyers with a limited warranty that covers “construction defects,” as defined in the limited warranty agreement provided to each home buyer, for the length of its legal liability for such defects (which may be up to ten years in some circumstances), as determined by the law of the state in which the Company builds. The limited warranty covering construction defects is transferable to subsequent buyers not under direct contract with the Company and requires that homebuyers agree to the definitions and procedures set forth in the warranty, including the submission of unresolved construction-related disputes to binding arbitration. In connection with the limited warranty covering construction defects, the Company maintains general liability insurance coverage. The Company believes that its insurance policy will respond to construction defect claims on homes that close during each policy period for the duration of the Company’s legal liability, upon satisfaction of the applicable self-insured retention. The insurance policy provides a single policy of insurance to the Company and its subcontractors. As a result, the Company is no longer required to obtain proof of insurance from its subcontractors nor be named as an additional insured under their individual insurance policies regarding the subcontractors' general liability policies for work on the Company's projects. The subcontractors still must provide proof of insurance regarding general liability coverage for off-site work, worker's compensation and auto coverage. Furthermore, the Company generally requires that each subcontractor and design professional agreement provide the Company with an indemnity, subject to various limitations. 
There can be no assurance, however, that the terms and limitations of the limited warranty will be enforceable against the homebuyers, that the Company will be able to renew its insurance coverage or renew it at reasonable rates, that the Company will not be liable for damages, the cost of repairs, and/or the expense of litigation surrounding possible construction defects, soil subsidence or building-related claims or that claims will not arise out of uninsurable events not covered by insurance and not subject to effective indemnification agreements with the Company’s subcontractors and design professionals or that such subcontractors and design professionals will be viable entities at the time of the claim.
Raw Materials
Typically, all of the raw materials and most of the components used in our business are readily available in the United States. Most are standard items carried by major suppliers. However, a rapid increase in the number of homes started or other market conditions could cause delays in the delivery of, shortages in, or higher prices for necessary materials. Delivery delays or the inability to obtain necessary materials could result in delays in the delivery of homes under construction. We have established national purchase programs for certain materials and we continue to monitor the supply markets to achieve the best prices available.
Sale of Lots and Land
In the ordinary course of business, the Company continually evaluates land sales and has sold, and expects that it will continue to sell, land as market and business conditions warrant. The Company may also sell both multiple lots to other builders (bulk sales) and improved individual lots for the construction of custom homes where the presence of such homes adds to the quality of the community. In addition, the Company may acquire sites with commercial, industrial and multi-family parcels which will generally be sold to third-party developers.
14

Customer Financing
The Company seeks to assist its home buyers in obtaining mortgage financing for qualified buyers. Substantially all home buyers utilize long-term mortgage financing to purchase a home and mortgage lenders will usually make loans only to qualified borrowers. In connection with the Polygon Acquisition in 2014, the Company acquired a membership interest in an unconsolidated joint venture which provides certain mortgage brokerage services, in part, to its customers in Washington and Oregon. In addition, in 2015 the Company announced the formation of a separate unconsolidated joint venture, of which it holds a membership interest, which provides a variety of mortgage banking services, in part, to its customers in California, Nevada, Arizona and Colorado. While the Company's mortgage joint ventures may offer or provide certain mortgage services to the Company's homebuyers, the Company's homebuyers may obtain mortgage financing to purchase its homes from any lender or other provider of their choice.
Information Systems and Controls
The Company assigns a high priority to the development and maintenance of its budget and cost control systems and procedures. The Company’s segment offices are connected to corporate headquarters through a fully integrated accounting, financial and operational management information system. Through this system, management regularly evaluates the status of its projects in relation to budgets to determine the cause of any variances and, where appropriate, adjusts the Company’s operations to capitalize on favorable variances or to limit adverse financial impacts.
Regulation
The Company and its competitors are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction and similar matters, including local regulation which imposes restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can ultimately be built within the boundaries of a particular project. The Company and its competitors may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future in the states in which it operates. Because the Company usually purchases land with entitlements, the Company believes that the moratoriums would adversely affect the Company only if they arose from unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues such as insufficient water or sewage facilities. Local and state governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects in their jurisdiction. However, these are normally locked-in when the Company receives entitlements.
The Company and its competitors are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment. The particular environmental laws which apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site, the site’s environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site. These environmental laws may result in delays, may cause the Company and its competitors to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. The Company’s projects in California are especially susceptible to restrictive government regulations and environmental laws. However, environmental laws have not, to date, had a material adverse impact on the Company’s operations. The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, California Lyon, is licensed as a general building contractor in California, Arizona and Nevada, in various municipalities within Colorado as required, and in Oregon. In addition, California Lyon's wholly-owned subsidiary, Polygon WLH LLC, is licensed as a general building contractor in Washington and Oregon, and the additional special purpose entities acquired through the Polygon Acquisition hold such a license in Washington or Oregon, as applicable to their location of business operations. California Lyon holds a corporate real estate license under the California Real Estate Law.
Competition
The homebuilding industry is highly competitive and fragmented, particularly in the low and medium-price range where the Company currently concentrates a significant amount of its activities. Homebuilders compete for, among other things, homebuyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. The Company competes for homebuyers primarily on the basis of a number of interrelated factors including home design and location, construction quality, customer service and satisfaction, and reputation. The Company believes that it competes effectively in its existing markets as a result of its product and geographic diversity, substantial development expertise and its reputation as a low-cost producer of quality homes. Further, the Company believes that it sometimes gains a competitive advantage in locations where changing regulations make it difficult for competitors to obtain entitlements and/or government approvals which the Company has already obtained. Nevertheless, existing and increased competition could hurt the Company's business, as it could prevent the Company from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder its growth efforts, and lead to pricing pressures on the Company's homes that may adversely impact its margins and revenues. Furthermore, a number of the Company’s competitors have larger staffs, larger marketing organizations and substantially greater financial 
15

resources than those of the Company, and accordingly, they may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which the Company operates. Many of these competitors also have longstanding relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which the Company operates. The Company also competes for sales with individual resales of existing homes and with available rental housing.
Seasonality
The Company’s operations are historically seasonal, with the highest new order activity typically occurring in the spring and summer, which is impacted by the timing of project openings and competition in surrounding projects, among other factors. In addition, a majority of the Company’s home deliveries typically occur in the third and fourth quarter of each fiscal year, based on the construction cycle times of our homes between four and eight months. As a result, the Company’s revenues, cash flow and profitability are higher in that same period.
Financing
The Company provides for its ongoing cash requirements principally from internally generated funds from the sales of real estate, outside borrowings and by forming new joint ventures with venture partners that provide a substantial portion of the capital required for certain projects. In addition, the Company makes use of the funds received from certain recent corporate transactions including the Company's initial public offering of equity securities, senior notes offerings and other capital markets transactions.
As of December 31, 2016, California Lyon has outstanding its 5.75% Senior Notes due 2019, 8.5% Senior Notes due 2020, 7% Senior Notes due 2022, Subordinated Amortizing Notes due 2017, certain construction and land seller notes payable, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and a letter of credit from its revolving credit facility. Parent, California Lyon and their subsidiaries and joint ventures have financed, and may in the future finance, certain project and land acquisitions with construction loans secured by real estate inventories, seller-provided financing, lot option agreements and land banking transactions. In January 2017, the Company engaged in a refinancing transaction pursuant to which it completed the sale of $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2025 in a private placement with registration rights, the net proceeds from which were used, together with cash on hand, to pay off in full the outstanding aggregate principal amount of $425 million of the Company’s previously outstanding 8.5% senior notes due 2020. See Note 17 for additional details regarding this refinancing transaction.
Corporate Organization and Personnel
The Company combines decentralized management in those aspects of its business where detailed knowledge of local market conditions is important (such as governmental processing, construction, land development and sales and marketing), with centralized management in those functions where the Company believes central control is required (such as approval of land acquisitions, finance, treasury, human resources and legal matters).
As of December 31, 2016, the Company employed 591 full-time employees, including corporate staff, supervisory personnel of construction projects, warranty service personnel for completed projects, as well as persons engaged in administrative, finance and accounting, engineering, sales and marketing activities.
The Company believes that its relations with its employees have been good. Some employees of the subcontractors the Company utilizes are unionized, but none of the Company’s employees are union members. Although there have been temporary work stoppages in the building trades in the Company’s areas of operation, none has had any material impact upon the Company’s overall operations.
