To achieve this, Pareteum has developed patent pending software platforms which are connected to 45 Mobile networks in 65 counties using multiple different communications channels including mobile telephony, data, SMS, VOIP, OTT services – all over the world. Pareteum integrates all these disparate communications methods and services and brings them to life for customers and application developers, allowing communications to become value-added.

At Pareteum, our mission is to create an easily accessible open mobility system for the world. We believe that open software and interfaces for mobility and applications will create more innovation, economic freedom, and opportunity equality worldwide, just like the internet did for information.
 

The Pareteum Ecosystem
----------------------

 
Our value proposition intersects with numerous applications and industries. It is our strong belief that no other company in the Communications-as-a-Service market offers similarly broad value in such a comprehensive way. An easily accessible open mobility system for the world is difficult to get started because it requires a “network effect”. The network effect is an observable condition that yields increased value to the “new easily accessible open mobility system for the world”, and all users of the system as more users come on board. The essence of this point is that every communication – a transaction – requires both a sender and recipient who are willing to access and use the new system. We aim to provide the marketplace exchange on which these transactions take place, and will attract new users.
 
To overcome the difficulty of achieving the “network effect”, our strategy is to begin attracting new users into the mobility and digital applications space, via our initial use case (managed services platforms). Our customer deployed managed services platform does not require a network effect for success. This has been partially accomplished by deploying Managed Services for our anchor customers. This has begun the creation a critical mass of subscribers required for the network effect to develop. This network effect will be perfected by further deployments into new segments and geographies with our Global Mobility Cloud Services and our Applications Exchange and Development Platform.
 
The Pareteum Ecosystem consists of three complementary platform suites: (1) the Managed Services Platform, (2) the Global Cloud Services Platform and (3) the Application Exchange & Developer Platform:

Business Model
--------------

 
At Pareteum, our mission is to create an easily accessible open mobility system for the world. We believe that open software and interfaces for communications services will create more innovation, economic freedom, and opportunity equality worldwide, just like the internet did for information.
 
However, an easily accessible open mobility system for the world is challenging to scale because it requires a “network effect”. The network effect is the principle that a service yields increased value as it grows. The essence of this point is that our business and our services will grow in value as we grow and scale. We aim to achieve that growth by providing the marketplace exchange on which these communications and transactions take place, and in doing so we attract new users and more customers.
 
To achieve our desired and rapid growth, we are using our managed services solutions as a launching pad from which to grow our Global Cloud Services Platform and Application Exchange & Developer Platform. This process is already well underway, including with our anchor customers, Vodafone and Zain.
 

Go-to-Market and Growth Strategy
--------------------------------

 
Pareteum is in fast-growth mode, which will be achieved through a combination of organic growth as well as targeted and accretive Mergers & Acquisitions.
 
Pareteum continues to win new long-term contractual business at an unprecedented pace. We expect this pace to increase throughout the coming year and beyond. We see many new opportunities, including those that leverage our support of emerging technologies, which is at the heart of our identity management and payment systems integration plans.
 
Our focus is on selling and implementing new communications services and IoT opportunities as fast as possible, as the world of connected devices and people continues to rise on a daily basis.
 
We will measure our growth in the numbers of ‘Connections’ that we on-board to our platforms, be they SIM cards, handsets, devices, vehicles etc.
 
Our go-to-market strategy uses a four-phase approach:
 

Phase 1: | We continue to attract new subscribers across all verticals to all our platforms through direct sales, existing channel partnerships and new initiatives such as referral programs. 
---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Phase 2: | We will continue to on-board new communication services providers, force multiplying our own growth, largely through business development and direct sales in each of our four defined sales regions (North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pac). 
---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Phase 3: | We will drive adoption through a twin approach. First, we will be on-boarding more Connections which are already active on our Managed Services and Global Cloud Platforms, as our initial user base. Second, we will be drawing in new customers and end-users to the Application Exchange & Developer Platform. These will be people with the greatest pain point, who are underserved by the current mobility networks and applications (including in developing markets).
---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Phase 4: | At this stage, our strategic Application Exchange & Developer Platform customers will have their own go-to-market strategy, creating shared value, ranging from traditional consumer strategies to sophisticated B2B and B2B2C strategies, driving and expanding our ecosystem to new heights. We also anticipate maturity in Blockchain deployments and smart-contracts creating new use-cases and revenue channels. 
---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The phases described above are already being implemented, in parallel as far as possible, for the fastest most sustainable growth and this highlights our strategy for accelerating the world’s shift to an open mobility and application network. When we’re successful, it will accelerate the pace of innovation in the world, create more economic freedom, and provide better mobility services to billions of underserved people.

Competitive Differentiation
---------------------------

 
The Communications-as-a-Service (CaaS) market is moving quickly. The Company believes that the key competitive differentiators in the near-term will be:
 

§ | Scale and international reach of connectivity
--+----------------------------------------------


§ | Comprehensiveness of Platform offerings
--+----------------------------------------


§ | Ease of deployment and implementation
--+--------------------------------------


§ | Scalability and reliability of service
--+---------------------------------------

Pareteum considers itself well placed to be judged on those criteria. The Company is confident that its network of global and international connectivity partners will enable it to access markets that currently under-served and compete equally with larger competitors in mature markets. In addition, Pareteum is confident that few other players have the breadth of value-added services to complement the core connectivity platforms.
 
Our competitors fall into three broad categories:
 

§ | Traditional telecom/infrastructure vendors.
--+--------------------------------------------


§ | Large software solution and SaaS vendors - offering a suite of specialized software components, solutions and APIs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Niche solution providers, providing narrowly focused BSS/OSS and prepaid solutions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and sales and marketing resources, as well as greater brand and market awareness, and consequently may be able to react more quickly to competitive pressures. As we execute on our growth strategies, and enter new markets, or disrupt markets and replace incumbents, we expect competition to become more intense.
 
One key tenet in our competitive strategy, however, is to actually lower the competitive barriers to market for new players (customers) to create new mobility and communications applications and businesses. We intend to disrupt existing markets and have the advantage of quick time-to-market for those newly enabled business models and opportunities. These include, for example:
 

§ | Uniquely tailored data services such as unlimited social media, messaging apps or streaming music services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Global roaming connectivity without local infrastructure: e.g. business executives using a multi-SIM worldwide phone.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Creation of personal, branded, mobile services.
--+------------------------------------------------


§ | One-stop shop for bundles of IoT and M2M services: through plug-ins to multiple vertical applications and specialized platforms.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
