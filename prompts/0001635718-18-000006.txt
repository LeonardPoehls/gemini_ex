ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Gannett Co., Inc. (Gannett, we, us, our, or the company) is an innovative, digitally focused media and marketing solutions company committed to strengthening communities across our network. Gannett owns ReachLocal, Inc. (ReachLocal), a digital marketing solutions company, the USA TODAY NETWORK (made up of USA TODAY (USAT) and 109 local media organizations in 34 states in the U.S. and Guam, including digital sites and affiliates), and Newsquest (a wholly owned subsidiary operating in the United Kingdom (U.K.) with more than 170 local media brands). Through the USA TODAY NETWORK and Newsquest, Gannett delivers high-quality, trusted content where and when consumers want to engage with it on virtually any device or platform. Additionally, the company has strong relationships with thousands of marketers in both our U.S. and U.K. markets due to our large local and national sales forces and robust advertising and marketing solutions product suite. The company reports in two operating segments, publishing and ReachLocal, plus a corporate and other category. A full description of our segments is included in Note 14 — Segment reporting of the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements.
The company has made both internal and external digital investments to address consumers' changing habits toward the consumption of news and information on digital devices as well as marketers' changing spending habits towards digital products. In 2017, total digital revenues were $994.9 million, or 32% of total company revenues. The USA TODAY NETWORK, with more than 3,000 journalists, averaged approximately 117 million(a) (see "References" section below) monthly unique visitors who access content through desktops, smartphones, and tablets. In September 2017, the company achieved a record 125 million(a) unique digital visitors in the U.S. In the U.K., Newsquest is a publishing and digital leader with more than 900 journalists and a network of web sites that attracts over 26 million(b) unique visitors monthly.
Publishing Segment
Our publishing segment comprises the USA TODAY NETWORK (as described above) and Newsquest. Since its introduction in 1982, USA TODAY has been a cornerstone of the national news landscape and is a recognizable and respected brand. Through the execution of our business strategy over the last two years, we have taken a series of steps that have culminated in the creation of the USA TODAY NETWORK.
•In 2015, we began to include the USA TODAY local edition as an insert each day in 35 of our local daily publications, which includes News, Money, and Life content, and throughout the network USA TODAY sports coverage was integrated into local sports sections. 
•In 2016, we leveraged the strong USA TODAY brand and created the largest local to national media network in the country, the USA TODAY NETWORK. 
•In 2017, we started a branding refresh of our print and digital products across our U.S. markets that will continue into 2018. This refresh is designed to unify our digital network, modernize our visual storytelling, create a more contemporary look for our advertisers and partnerships, and attract new audiences. 
The USA TODAY NETWORK brand and audience reach will be further leveraged as we build out new digital businesses, similar to our successful launch of “For the Win” (ftw.usatoday.com), a unique digital property that provides sports fans with social news and curated analysis, and our recent investment in Grateful Ventures, a startup digital content network that operates in the lifestyle vertical. 
The scale of our consumer audience across our publishing business makes us an attractive marketing partner to various national and local businesses trying to reach consumers. We are the leading newspaper publisher in the U.S. in terms of circulation and have the third largest digital audience in the News and Information category based on December 2017 comScore Media Metrics; per those metrics, our content reaches more people digitally than Fox News, CBSnews.com, New York Times Digital, BuzzFeed.com, NBC News, or WashingtonPost.com.(a)
•At our U.S. local publishing operations, the average daily print readership is more than 11 million on Sundays and 5 million daily Monday through Saturday, while the digital audience averages 43 million(a) unique visitors per month. At our flagship brand, USA TODAY, print readership averages over 2.6 million daily Monday to Friday, while the digital audience averages over 93 million(a) unique visitors per month. While our print audience tends to skew to an older demographic, our digital audience skews younger as evidenced by 54%(a) of the total U.S. digital millennial audience (ages 18 - 34) accessing USA TODAY NETWORK content.

•In the U.K., our wholly-owned subsidiary Newsquest has a total average print readership of over 5.7 million every week. Newsquest’s digital audience continued to grow in 2017, with average monthly unique users of its network rising to 26.3 million(b).
As digital media consumption shifts to mobile devices and social media, our audiences on these platforms continue to grow. The USA TODAY NETWORK consistently ranks in the top 3 in mobile web unique visitors in the News and Information category, finishing December 2017 at #2(a). Total mobile web page views for the USA TODAY NETWORK grew 5%(b) in 2017, evidence our content successfully resonates on mobile devices. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we began to roll out a new mobile web experience with preliminary results showing greater user engagement. At Newsquest, mobile monthly unique users increased 7%(b) and mobile article page views grew 15%(b) in 2017 on a year-over-year basis. On social platforms, we focused on creating franchises to drive user engagement and had great success with our Animalkind and Humankind franchises. In 2017, Animalkind produced 266.3 million(c) video views and Humankind produced 95.9 million(c) video views on Facebook with 119 million(c) post engagements (liked, shared, commented) and 62 million(c) post engagements, respectively. These results show that regardless of platform our content drives engagement.
Gannett continues to build an innovative video network, with best-in-class video content to attract new audiences and drive revenue growth through enhancing existing revenue streams and creating new innovative products. In 2017, our U.S. local properties generated 292 million(b) cross-platform video plays, an increase of 33%(b) year-over-year. Building on the success of our first season of VRtually There, a series that tells the nation’s stories and delivers immersive and original content in virtual reality, we launched season two in 2017. Also during the year, we launched a drone storytelling initiative in 10 markets to support local and national storytelling; this program was critical in providing the comprehensive video coverage of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, giving readers a bird’s eye view of the damage caused by the hurricanes. 
The publishing segment generates revenue primarily through advertising and subscriptions to our print and digital publications and to a lesser extent commercial printing and distribution, marketing, and data services. USA TODAY and our local publications have developed an efficient operating model utilizing integrated shared support for back-office operations such as financial services and accounting, content design and layout services, print and digital creative development and certain sales and service platforms. This model also serves as a point of leverage and synergy opportunity with respect to businesses acquired by the company. 
Advertising: In 2017, publishing segment advertising revenues of $1.5 billion comprised 53% of total publishing segment revenues, down from 55% in 2016. We sell and track our advertising sales in three primary categories: retail, national, and classified. Below are descriptions of the three categories:
•Retail advertising is associated with local merchants or locally owned businesses. Retail includes regional and national chains (such as department and grocery stores) that sell in the local market. Ads run in our print products and across our digital network. 
•National advertising is principally associated with advertisers who are promoting national products or brands. Examples are pharmaceuticals, travel, airlines, or packaged goods. Both retail and national ads also include preprints, typically stand-alone multiple page fliers inserted into daily and Sunday print products.
•Classified advertising includes the major categories of automotive, employment, legal, and real estate/rentals. Advertising for classified segments is published in the classified sections or other sections within the publication, on our digital platforms, on affiliated digital platforms, and in certain magazines.
We have an experienced local advertising staff that sells retail, all classified excluding employment, and national advertising across multiple platforms, including print, desktop, mobile and tablet, as well as niche publications. Additionally, our staff sells the ReachLocal suite of digital marketing solutions, including search engine marketing, social media marketing, and website development. We have a separate national advertising sales force focused on the largest national advertisers and a separate sales organization to support classified employment sales.
Our advertising staff employs a multi-platform approach to advertising sales, which can be specifically tailored to the individual needs of advertisers from small, locally-owned merchants to large, complex businesses. We believe local and national advertisers find it challenging to manage the complexity of their media budgets, particularly on the digital side. They are seeking to reach a shifting audience and are struggling to influence attitudes and behavior at each stage of the purchase path. Our diverse sales force, unique industry scale, and broad portfolio of print and digital products position us to solve these challenges. Through our media planning process, we present advertisers with targeted, integrated solutions that help advertisers reach this shifting audience. The planning process leverages our considerable strength in data analysis and secondary research, with the result being a tailored media and marketing plan in which the individual elements work in concert to amplify and reinforce advertisers' messages and solve their business needs.

Our advertising revenues are subject to moderate seasonality due primarily to fluctuations in advertising volumes. Our advertising revenues for publishing are typically highest in the company's fourth quarter due to holiday and seasonal advertising and lowest in the first quarter following the holiday season. The volume of advertising sales in any period is also impacted by other external factors such as competitors' pricing, advertisers' decisions to increase or decrease their advertising expenditures in response to anticipated consumer demand, and general economic conditions.
Circulation: In 2017, publishing segment circulation revenues of $1.1 billion comprised 40% of total publishing segment revenues, consistent with 39% in 2016. In a trend generally consistent within the domestic publishing industry, print circulation volumes declined in 2017. Circulation revenues in the U.S. are derived from our All Access Content Subscription Model, single-copy sales, hotel sales, and digital-only sales. Circulation revenues at Newsquest are more centered on single-copy sales with a larger portion of weekly paid-for titles and free titles as compared to our U.S. publications. Additionally, Newsquest employs a regional model, generally involving clustering of the publication of a free print product alongside a paid-for print product, which allows for the cross-selling of advertising serving the same or contiguous markets.
Our All Access Content Subscription Model in our local markets includes access to our content via multiple platforms including websites, smartphone and tablet applications, and e-newspapers, with subscription prices that vary according to the frequency of delivery of the print edition. Also available to subscribers are digital only or digital plus Sunday subscriptions. We currently have more than 1.8 million digital activated subscribers via our All Access Content Subscription Model. We offer our customers EZ Pay, a payment system which automatically deducts subscription payments from customers' credit cards or bank accounts; we see better subscriber retention with our EZ Pay customers. At the end of 2017, EZ Pay was used by 58% of all subscribers at local U.S. Gannett sites (not including USA TODAY). 
Growing our digital only subscribers is a strategic priority and, in 2017, our digital only subscribers increased by 50% to 340,808. Our primary digital subscriber acquisition tactics include onsite promotion, email marketing, social marketing and event marketing. A variety of pricing strategies are used throughout the year, including discounted introductory periods and sales, to encourage trial and habituation before transitioning to the full rate. In the U.S. local markets, approximately 81% of circulation revenue is derived from our All Access Content Subscription Model and digital-only subscriptions.
In addition to the subscription model in our U.S. local markets, single-copy print editions continue to be sold at retail outlets and account for approximately 11% of daily and 20% of Sunday net paid circulation volume. Approximately 81% of net paid circulation volumes of USA TODAY are generated by single-copy sales at retail outlets, vending machines, or hotels that provide copies to their guests. The remainder is generated by home and office delivery, mail, educational, and other sales. 
Production and Distribution: Gannett Publishing Services (GPS) was formed to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost associated with the production and distribution of the Gannett printed products across all divisions in the U.S. GPS manages the production and circulation operations for all our local daily and non-daily newspapers as well as USA TODAY and runs a commercial printing and delivery business that generates revenues from third party publishers. 
GPS leverages our existing assets, including employee talent and experience, physical plants and equipment, and our vast national and local distribution networks. GPS is particularly focused on maximizing our geographic footprint to most efficiently produce and transport our printed product. GPS is responsible for internal and external printing, packaging, and distribution. Over the last several years, GPS has actively outsourced printing activities to competitive local market or regional printing businesses in situations where the cost to outsource would benefit Gannett. Alternatively, in certain cases, GPS will utilize excess printing capacity to print competitor and other publications.
Newsquest operates its publishing activities in a similar manner to GPS, through regional centers to maximize the use of management, finance, printing, and personnel resources. This regional approach allows the business to leverage a variety of back-office and administrative activities to optimize financial results and enables the group to offer readers and advertisers a range of attractive products across the market.
Competition: Our U.S. and U.K. publishing operations and affiliated digital platforms compete with other media and digital companies for advertising and marketing spend. Our publishing operations also compete for circulation and readership against other news and information outlets and amateur content creators. While very few of our publishing operations have similar daily print competitors that are published in the same city, our print products compete with the following types of businesses:
•National, regional and smaller suburban area newspapers and free or paid publications
5

•Other media including magazines, television, direct mail, cable television, radio, outdoor/billboard advertising, directories, e-mail marketing, web sites, mobile-device platforms and social platforms. 
Development of opportunities in, and competition from, digital media, including web sites, tablet, mobile and social products continues to increase. As such, there is very little barrier to entry and limited capital requirements for new companies to enter the market with competitive digital products. The company will continue to expand its audience reach in the digital media industry through internal audience development efforts, content distribution programs, acquisitions and partnerships to protect its audience market share. Additionally, the company will continue to improve its suite of advertising and marketing services products through both internal development and acquisitions and partnerships to protect its advertising market share. 
Environmental Regulation: The company is committed to protecting the environment. Our goal is to ensure our production and distribution facilities comply with federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and to incorporate appropriate environmental practices and standards in its operations. We are one of the industry leaders in the use of recycled newsprint. During 2017, 11% of our domestic newsprint purchases contained recycled content, with an average recycled content of 20%. 
Our operations use inks, solvents, and fuels. The use, management and disposal of these substances are sometimes regulated by environmental agencies. We retain a corporate environmental consultant who, along with internal and outside counsel, oversees regulatory compliance and preventive measures. Some of our subsidiaries have been included among the potentially responsible parties in connection with sites that have been identified as possibly requiring environmental remediation, although we do not currently anticipate these designations will have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.
Raw Materials: Newsprint, which is the basic raw material used in our print publications, has been and may continue to be subject to significant price changes from time to time. We purchase newsprint primarily from 12 domestic and global suppliers. During 2017, our total newsprint consumption was approximately 270,000 metric tons, including consumption by our owned and operated print sites, third-party printing sites, and Newsquest. Newsprint consumption in 2017 was 9% less than in 2016. On a pro-forma basis without tonnage from businesses acquired during 2016, newsprint consumption was 20% lower compared to 2016. We continue to moderate newsprint consumption and expense through the use of lighter basis weight paper. Our ability to supply the needs of our publishing operations depends upon the continuing availability of newsprint at an acceptable price, and the results of operations of our publishing segment may be impacted significantly by changes in newsprint prices. The availability and price of newsprint is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which are described more fully under “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Joint Operating Agencies: Our publishing subsidiaries in Detroit and York each participate in a joint operating agency (JOA). In each instance, the JOA performs the production, sales, distribution, and back office functions for our subsidiaries and the publisher of another publication pursuant to a joint operating agreement. Operating results for the Detroit and York JOAs are fully consolidated along with a charge for the minority partner's share of profits. 
ReachLocal Segment
The mission of our ReachLocal segment is to deliver customers to local businesses. ReachLocal, Inc., which began in 2004 and was acquired by Gannett in 2016, helps local businesses advertise online to find those customers. We believe local businesses want a single, unified solution to solve their digital marketing needs. Our total digital marketing solution consists of products and solutions in three categories: digital advertising (including ReachSearch™, ReachDisplay™, ReachSocial Ads™, and ReachRetargeting™), web presence (including ReachSite+ReachEdge™, ReachSEO™, ReachCast™, ReachListings™, and TotalLiveChat™), and software-as-a-service (ReachEdge™ and Kickserv™). In April 2017, Gannett acquired SweetIQ, a provider of location and reputation management Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) solutions that enable businesses to manage their location data and measure consumer engagement. SweetIQ was integrated into our ReachLocal product suite as ReachListings™ and continues to be sold to multi-location businesses under the SweetIQ brand.
Products: Our search engine marketing (SEM) solution, ReachSearch™, combines search engine marketing optimized across multiple publishers, call tracking and call recording services, and industry leading campaign performance transparency. ReachSearch™ is a leading SEM offering for local businesses and has won numerous awards since its rollout, including most recently winning Google's Quality Score Champion Award in North America. ReachSearch™ is optimized for local markets in each of the territories in which our ReachLocal segment operates. ReachSearch™ accounted for 77% of our ReachLocal segment’s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017.

We also offer online advertising products focused on maximizing local businesses’ exposure by displaying their ads on websites that, in the aggregate, reach an estimated 90% of the U.S. online audience. Our display products include a retargeting solution to target consumers who have previously visited a specific client's website through a ReachSearch™ campaign or a ReachDisplay™ campaign or who have previously searched for a client's keywords (ReachRetargeting™) and a Facebook advertising solution (ReachSocial Ads™), among other products. These products are generally available in North America and selectively available in ReachLocal's international markets.
In addition, we offer a number of web presence solutions. These solutions include websites (ReachSite™), search engine optimization (ReachSEO™), social (ReachCast™), chat (TotalLiveChat™), listings (ReachListings™), and other products and solutions, all focused on expanding and leveraging clients' web presence. Often, these products are designed to work in concert with our digital advertising products with a goal of enhancing clients’ marketing return on investment. These products are generally available in North America and selectively available in our international markets.
We also offer software products designed to enable our clients to both easily assess the efficacy of their marketing efforts and to facilitate their interactions with their customers. Our ReachEdge™ solution is a marketing automation platform that includes tools for capturing web traffic information and converting leads into new customers for clients. ReachEdge™ provides clients with tools designed to significantly improve their conversion of leads to customers and helps clients stay top-of-mind during the prospect's decision-making process by using integrated marketing automation to send new prospects targeted e-mails and alerts to the client's staff reminding them to follow up on each lead. ReachEdge™ also provides reports to show clients how many leads they are getting from each marketing source and other important business insights. ReachEdge™ is available in most of our markets. Our Kickserv™ solution is a cloud-based business management software for service businesses. Kickserv™ allows us to provide an end-to-end solution to clients that starts with lead generation (e.g., ReachSearch™, ReachDisplay™, and ReachSEO™), includes lead conversion (ReachEdge™), and then closes and manages the business relationship (Kickserv™). Kickserv™ is available in North America.
Distribution: We deliver our suite of products and solutions to local businesses through a combination of our proprietary technology platform, our sales force, and select third-party agencies and resellers. Our ReachLocal segment has sales operations in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Germany, Austria, Brazil, and Mexico. Approximately 77% of revenues are derived in North America and the remaining 23% from other international markets. All ReachLocal segment revenues are digital revenues.
Competition: The market for local online advertising solutions is intensely competitive and rapidly changing. The market is highly fragmented as there are a number of smaller companies which provide internet marketing services at highly competitive prices and, increasingly, we compete with vertical-specific small and medium-sized business (SMB) marketing providers who offer solutions tailored for specific verticals. In addition, the online publishers that we utilize for clients, such as Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft, generally offer their products and services through self-service platforms. Many traditional, offline media companies also offer online advertising solutions and have large, direct sales forces and digital publishing properties. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, ReachLocal expects competition to intensify in the future.
Strategy
Gannett’s vision is to become the daily destination for consumers and marketers seeking meaningful connections with their communities across print, digital, and other channels. We are committed to a business strategy that drives audience growth and engagement by delivering deeper content experiences to our audience while offering the products and marketing expertise our advertisers desire. The execution of this strategy should allow the company to continue its evolution from a more traditional print media business to a digitally focused media and marketing services business. As part of the execution of this strategy, in late 2017, the company announced a management reorganization to align its operations under two main areas: Marketing Solutions and Consumer. 
Key elements of our strategy are as follows:
Leverage nationwide scale and local presence to expand and deepen our relationships with consumers and marketers. The broad reach of both the USA TODAY NETWORK, with 109 local properties plus USA TODAY, and Newsquest, with more than 170 local media brands, gives us the ability to deepen our relationships with both consumers and advertisers at a national and local level. Through the USA TODAY NETWORK, we bring consumers the local news and information that impacts their day-to-day lives while keeping them informed of the national events that impact their country. To further drive audience growth and engagement across our domestic and international media brands, we will leverage the network to expand our content offerings to extend beyond news into new verticals, including lifestyle content such as food, health and fitness. We 
7

will deepen our relationships with our subscribers by offering a membership model, providing access to local events and experiences. For advertisers, we will leverage our broad sales footprint and strong customer relationships to aggressively expand our digital marketing services business into our local markets, both domestically and internationally. Given our extensive client base and volume of digital campaigns, we will also use data and insights to offer new and dynamic advertising products that can deliver superior results. 
Accelerate expansion of our digital businesses through innovative consumer experiences and new marketing solutions. In 2017, we continued development of new consumer experiences through innovative storytelling mediums like virtual reality and drones, as well as improvements to our digital products. We will continue to deepen overall engagement and drive audience growth in 2018 and beyond by extending our content offerings to new platforms such as podcasts, voice and longer form video franchises. During 2017, we successfully integrated ReachLocal into our local markets as our digital marketing services provider. In 2018, we will continue to expand our digital marketing footprint in these markets as currently only a small percentage of our client base takes advantage of our digital marketing capabilities. We will introduce new customer solutions that will enable marketers to more easily track their return on investment across all their marketing channels. We also plan on extending our branded content offerings to the local level and continuing to evolve our innovative ad products offered to both national and local advertisers. 
Pursue opportunistic acquisitions. We are well-positioned to pursue value-enhancing investments and acquisitions while being both disciplined and opportunistic in our acquisition strategy. Our balance sheet remains strong and our cash flow generation capabilities provide us with the financial flexibility to pursue opportunities of various sizes. Our focus has shifted from acquiring traditional print businesses to digital acquisitions that either expand our digital marketing services portfolio or broaden our content offerings. For example, in 2017 we acquired SweetIQ, a location and customer engagement software provider, which helped expand the product portfolio of ReachLocal. In 2017, we made a majority investment in a startup digital content network (“Grateful Ventures”) that operates in the lifestyle vertical to quickly and efficiently expand our content offerings beyond the traditional news category. We will still explore traditional print acquisitions that fit our geographic profile and offer strong synergy opportunities but likely on a smaller scale than previous acquisitions.
Maximize the value of our legacy print business and rationalize our cost base. We will continue to drive the profitability of our traditional print operations by rationalizing our cost infrastructure and maximizing our revenue base. To drive greater cost savings, we will continue to centralize operations to increase efficiencies with focus on our printing and distribution centers, content creation network and advertising sales structure. Our economies of scale will enable us to continue to reduce supply chain costs while streamlining the process of producing newspapers. We will also explore outsourcing certain business functions to reduce costs. On the revenue side, we have implemented a new print advertising pricing program that encourages more frequent advertising in our printed product, which should deliver the advertiser improved return on investment and reduce the advertiser churn we are experiencing. Our circulation pricing strategy will center on strategic price increases while delivering greater value to our most loyal subscribers through membership opportunities. 
 Maintain a flexible balance sheet with emphasis on capital allocation. Through aggressive cost management and disciplined financial policies, we have been able to maintain a strong balance sheet with relatively low debt levels compared to our peers. Our strong balance sheet has enabled us to keep a flexible capital allocation policy with an emphasis on returning cash to shareholders. Since the beginning of 2016, we have paid a quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share to shareholders. In July 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a three-year, $150 million share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2017, 5.75 million shares have been repurchased under the program at an average cost of $8.70 per share.

History
Our newspaper business was founded by Frank E. Gannett and associates in 1906 and incorporated in 1923. We were separated from our former parent on June 29, 2015 when our former parent distributed 98.5% of the outstanding shares of Gannett common stock (also referred to herein as the spin-off or separation) to its stockholders on a pro rata basis. We are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol GCI and are headquartered in McLean, VA near Washington, DC.
Employees
We employed approximately 15,300 persons at our subsidiaries in the U.S. as of December 31, 2017. Approximately 14% of those employed by us in the U.S. are represented by labor unions, most of which are affiliated with one of seven international unions. These represented employees are covered by approximately 60 collective bargaining agreements. These agreements conform generally with the pattern of labor agreements in the publishing industry. We do not engage in industry-wide or company-wide bargaining. Our U.K. subsidiaries bargain with two unions over working practices, wages, and health and safety issues only. There were approximately 3,700 employees outside of the U.S., including approximately 3,000 employed by Newsquest in the U.K.
