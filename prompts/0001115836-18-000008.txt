Introduction

Belmond is a leading luxury hotel company and sophisticated adventure travel operator with exposure to both mature and emerging national economies. The Company’s predecessor began acquiring hotels in 1976 and organized the Company in 1994. Belmond currently owns, partially-owns and/or operates 46 properties (excluding one additional business scheduled for a future opening, the Belmond Cadogan Hotel in London, England), consisting of 36 highly individual deluxe hotels, one stand-alone restaurant, seven tourist trains and two river/canal cruise businesses. This portfolio includes one long-term leased hotel in Bali, Indonesia where the owner dispossessed Belmond from operation of the hotel in November 2013 (see Item 3—Legal Proceedings). The locations of Belmond's 46 properties operating in 24 countries are shown in the map on the preceding page. Belmond acquires, leases or manages only distinctive properties in areas of outstanding cultural, historic or recreational interest in order to provide luxury lifestyle experiences for the discerning traveler. 
Revenue, earnings and identifiable assets of Belmond in 2017, 2016 and 2015 for Belmond's business segments and geographic areas are presented in Note 24 to the Financial Statements (Item 8). Belmond's operating segments are aggregated into six reportable segments, namely owned hotels in each of Europe, North America and Rest of World, owned trains and cruises, part-owned/managed hotels, and part-owned/managed trains. 
Belmond revised the order of the presentation of these segments in the year ended December 31, 2016 and included a new sub-total to show management fees earned by the Company. In addition, Belmond reclassified certain expenses associated with the Company’s development team from the Part-owned/managed hotels segment to central costs. Prior periods have been re-presented to reflect the current period presentation. There has not been a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Hotels represent the largest part of Belmond’s business, contributing 86% of revenue in 2017, 87% of revenue in 2016 and 87% in 2015. Trains and cruises accounted for 13% of revenue in 2017, 13% of revenue in 2016 and 13% in 2015. Approximately 80% of Belmond’s customer revenue in 2017 was from leisure travelers, with approximately 44% originating from North America, 41% from Europe and the remaining 15% from elsewhere in the world.

Belmond’s worldwide portfolio of hotels currently in operation consists of 3,203 individual guest rooms and multiple-room suites, each known as a “key”. Hotels owned by Belmond in 2017 achieved an average daily room rate (“ADR”) of $510 (2016 - $490; 2015 - $481) and a revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) of $309 (2016 - $298; 2015 - $295).
In recent years, Belmond has sold to third parties a number of properties not considered key to Belmond’s portfolio of unique, high-valued properties. In March 2014, Belmond sold Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond on the eastern shore of Maryland, with Belmond continuing to manage the hotel under a ten-year management agreement (that permits termination on the fifth anniversary 
4

of the agreement) with the new owner. In May 2015, Belmond, together with its joint venture partner, each sold its 50% ownership interest in the entity which owned the Hotel Ritz by Belmond in Madrid, Spain and Belmond ended its agreement to manage the hotel. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements. On November 6, 2017, the entity that leased Belmond Orcaella provided notice of termination to the owner in respect of its charter agreement and on November 2, 2017, Belmond sold its interest in the entity which wholly owned Belmond Northern Belle. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements. 
On February 23, 2014, the Company (formerly known as Orient-Express Hotels Ltd.) announced that its board of directors had approved a proposal to operate the Company's portfolio of luxury hotels and travel experiences under a new brand name—"Belmond"—from March 10, 2014, and to change its principal Internet website address to belmond.com. Belmond has retained its long-term license agreement with SNCF, the French transportation company that owns the "Orient-Express" trademark, for the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train. With the decision to introduce the "Belmond" brand, Belmond also entered into an agreement with SNCF to terminate (with effect from December 31, 2014) the "Orient-Express" license for hotel use, without any cost or penalty. At the 2014 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, shareholders approved a change in Belmond's corporate name from Orient-Express Hotels Ltd. to Belmond Ltd. in order to align Belmond's corporate identity with that of its primary luxury brand. On July 28, 2014, Belmond changed the ticker symbol of its class A common shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange from OEH to BEL.
On March 21, 2014, Belmond entered into a $657,000,000 senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $552,000,000 seven-year term loan and a $105,000,000 five-year, dual-currency revolving credit facility. The term loan comprised a $345,000,000 U.S. dollar-denominated tranche and a €150,000,000 euro-denominated tranche ($207,000,000 as of the completion date). Belmond used the proceeds from the term loan to refinance substantially all of the funded debt of Belmond (other than the debt of Belmond Charleston Place, a consolidated variable interest entity with separate non-recourse financing). On June 2, 2015, Belmond entered into an amendment to its senior secured credit facility to reduce the interest rate on the euro-denominated tranche to EURIBOR plus a 3.00% margin from EURIBOR plus a 3.00% margin. The Company amended and restated its senior secured credit facility on July 3, 2017 to increase the term loan, extend the maturity dates on the revolving credit facility and the term loan to July 3, 2022 and July 3, 2024, respectively, and decrease the interest rates imposed on borrowings. The amended and restated credit agreement consists of a $603,434,000 seven-year term loan and a $100,000,000 five-year, multi-currency revolving credit facility. The term loan consists of a $400,000,000 U.S. dollar-denominated tranche and a €179,000,000 million euro-denominated tranche ($203,434,000 as of the completion date). See Note 11 to the Financial Statements.
In August 2014, Charleston Center LLC entered into an $86,000,000 loan secured on its real and personal property. This loan had no amortization and is non-recourse to Belmond. This loan had an August 2019 maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.12% per annum. In June 2016, Charleston Center LLC refinanced this loan with a $112,000,000 new loan with the same August 2019 maturity. The interest rate on the new loan is LIBOR plus 2.35% per annum, has no amortization and is non-recourse to Belmond. The additional proceeds were used to repay a 1984 development loan from a municipal agency in the principal amount of $10,000,000 and accrued interest of $16,819,000. In connection with the early repayment of the loan, Belmond negotiated a discount that resulted in a net gain, reported in the statements of consolidated operations during the year ended December 31, 2016, of $1,200,000 upon the extinguishment of the debt, including the payment of a tax indemnity to our partners in respect of their allocation of income from the discount arising on the cancellation of indebtedness. See Note 11 to the Financial Statements.
On July 8, 2014, Belmond announced the execution of a management agreement with Cadogan Hotel Partners Limited to operate Belmond Cadogan Hotel, a 64-key hotel in the Knightsbridge area of London, England. The 127-year old hotel closed at the end of July 2014 to undergo a $48,000,000 investment project. The fully renovated and re-conceptualized Belmond Cadogan Hotel is expected to open at the end of 2018 with refurbished public areas and the reconfiguration reduced to 54 keys in order to accommodate demand from luxury travelers for larger junior suites and suites.
On August 30, 2016, the Company commenced operations of Belmond Grand Hibernian, the first overnight luxury rail experience of its kind in Ireland. The luxury sleeper train accommodates up to 40 guests in 20 en-suite cabins. Belmond Grand Hibernian builds on the Company's expertise in operating a stable of the world's most famous trains, including Belmond Royal Scotsman, currently the U.K.'s only luxury touring sleeper train, and the legendary Venice Simplon-Orient-Express and Hiram Bingham in Peru.
On April 7, 2017, the Company and its joint venture partner acquired Las Casitas, a 20-key resort located in Colca Canyon in southern Peru. It is located on a 24 hectare site with 20 luxury individual bungalows. A soft goods renovation was completed in 2017, during which time the property remained open. 
On May 4, 2017, PeruRail commenced operations of Belmond Andean Explorer, a luxury sleeper train running through the Peruvian Highlands from Cusco to Lake Titicaca and Arequipa, accommodating up to 68 passengers. It consists of 21 carriages, which

Belmond owned and operated in Australia through 2003 and sold to PeruRail in 2016. The train was shipped from Australia to Peru and underwent renovations to its interiors to a luxury standard. 
On May 26, 2017, the Company acquired Cap Juluca, a 96-key luxury resort on the Caribbean Island of Anguilla, British West Indies. At the same time, the Company also entered into a 125-year ground lease with the Government of Anguilla for property that comprises approximately 167 acres, including approximately 250,000 square feet of additional developable beachfront land.

Belmond Khwai River Lodge, Belmond Eagle Island Lodge and Belmond Savute Elephant Lodge—39 keys in total—comprise Belmond’s African safari experience in Botswana consisting of three separate game-viewing lodges. Established in 1971, Belmond holds leases to the lodge sites in the Okavango River delta and nearby game reserves, where African wildlife can be observed from open safari vehicles or boats. The leases expire between 2021 and 2041. Botswana's Okavango Delta was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in June 2014. Each camp has 12 or 15 luxury one bedroom tents under thatched roofs, and guests travel between the camps by light aircraft. Boating, fishing, hiking and swimming are offered at the various sites.

Conde Nast Traveller included Belmond Eagle Island Lodge on its 2016 Hotlist and the property received an award from International Property & Travel in 2016. Belmond Savute Elephant Lodge closed in November 2017 for a full renovation and is expected to open in May 2018. The renovation includes upgrades to the infrastructure, enhancements to finishes, new food and beverage outlets including outdoor dining, a swimming pool, and the addition of a spa tent.
Asia

Belmond Napasai—68 keys including 14 private villas—is located on its own beach on the north side of Koh Samui island of Thailand in the Gulf of Siam. It originally opened in 2004 and features two restaurants, tennis courts, a swimming pool, a spa and water sports such as sailing, diving and snorkeling in the nearby coral reef. The guest rooms and garden cottages are arranged in sea view on a total site of about 40 owned acres, which includes vacant land for future expansion.

This long-term leased hotel opened in 2005 and offers two restaurants, a swimming pool and spa, and a free shuttle bus to the nearby town of Ubud, a cultural and arts center. Each key has its own private plunge pool.
As previously reported, following an unannounced dispossession of Belmond from Ubud Hanging Gardens by the third-party owner in November 2013, Belmond was unable to continue operating the hotel. Belmond believed this action by the owner was unlawful and in breach of its long-term lease arrangement and constituted a wrongful dispossession. Accordingly, Belmond has taken appropriate legal steps to protect its interests and is currently seeking to enforce its Singapore arbitral award for $8.5 million against the owner in Indonesia. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings.

Belmond La Résidence d’Angkor—59 keys—opened in 2002 and is situated in walled gardens in Siem Reap, Cambodia. The hotel occupies a site of about two acres under long-term lease until 2066.

Part-Owned/Managed Hotels
United States
Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond—78 keys—was built in 1812 as a country inn located in St. Michaels, Maryland on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay. Set on 25 waterfront acres, it is an attractive conference and vacation destination, particularly for guests from the Washington, D.C., Baltimore and Philadelphia areas.

As part of the management agreement, Belmond funded $3,000,000 of key money to be used for agreed capital enhancements.
Peru
Belmond has a 50%/50% joint venture with local investors in Peru which operates the following four hotels under Belmond’s exclusive management.

Belmond Hotel Monasterio—122 keys—is located in the ancient Inca capital of Cusco, an important tourist destination in Peru and a UNESCO World Heritage site. The hotel was originally built as a Spanish monastery in the 16th century, converted to hotel use in 1965, and has been upgraded since then. The guest rooms and two restaurants are arranged around open-air cloisters. Many of the guest rooms are specially oxygenated due to Cusco's high altitude. In 2015, Belmond completed a three-year phased renovation of guest rooms and bathrooms. The site measures approximately three acres under long-term lease until 2037, with options to renew until 2067. In 2017, we commenced the first phase of planning for the soft goods renovation of the lobby bar and two restaurants, which is expected to be completed in 2018.
Belmond Palacio Nazarenas—55 keys—is located adjacent to Belmond Hotel Monasterio in Cusco and is a former palace and convent which the joint venture has rebuilt as a separate hotel and opened in June 2012. This is an all-suite hotel arranged around courtyards and features oxygenated guest rooms, an outdoor heated swimming pool, spa, and poolside restaurant and bar. During construction, archeologists discovered Incan artifacts and foundations which have been preserved and displayed in the hotel. The property is subject to a lease until 2042, with an option to renew until 2067. In 2017, the joint venture commenced the first phase of planning to upgrade the main restaurant, which is expected to be completed in 2018.
Belmond Sanctuary Lodge—31 keys—is the only hotel at the famous mountaintop Inca ruins at Machu Picchu, a UNESCO World Heritage site. All of the rooms have been refurbished to a high standard. In 2016, the joint venture completed a three-year phased renovation of all guest rooms and suites, as well as the hotel's reception and public areas. In 2017, the Tinkuy buffet restaurant was refurbished. The joint venture leases the hotel as well as seven acres for possible future expansion at the foot of the ruins, close to the town on the Urubamba River where tourists arrive by train. The lease has been extended to 2025. See Item 3 — Legal Proceedings.
Belmond Hotel Rio Sagrado—23 keys including two villas—is owned by Belmond's Peru hotel joint venture and is located in the Sacred Valley of the Incas between Cusco and Machu Picchu. Opened in 2009, this rustic hotel has a spa with indoor plunge pool and extensive gardens beside the Urubamba River on a site of about six acres set against an imposing mountain backdrop.  The Sacred Valley is a popular part of holiday itineraries in Peru, and a station on Belmond’s PeruRail train service is a short distance from the hotel. During 2013, the joint venture refurbished the guest rooms, enlarged the spa and installed an outdoor heated swimming pool. In 2014, the property enhanced the main entry arrival with a new entry drive and landscape improvements and added a train platform/lounge to accommodate Hiram Bingham train guests stopping at the hotel. In 2015, the joint venture 
11

acquired an adjacent parcel of land of approximately two and a half acres on which the joint venture is contemplating further development. 
Belmond Las Casitas—20 keys—is located in Colca Canyon, a river canyon in southern Peru famed for being one of the world's deepest and a habitat for the giant Andean condor and having pre-Inca roots. It is located on a 24 hectare estate with 20 luxury individual bungalows, each with a private terrace, plunge pool, fireplace, indoor and outdoor shower, and hot tub. The resort includes a library, outdoor pool, spa, and restaurant and bar, with an on-property farm that provides organic produce for the restaurant. The Company acquired the property through its 50%/50% joint venture in Peruvian hotels in May 2017 and a soft goods renovation was completed in 2017.

Part-Owned/Managed Trains
PeruRail: Belmond and local Peruvian investors formed two 50%/50% joint venture companies (PeruRail S.A. ("PeruRail") and Ferrocarril Transandino S.A. ("FTSA")). FTSA was awarded in 1999 a 30-year concession to operate the track and other infrastructure of the state-owned railways in southern and southeastern Peru. The concession had an initial term of 30 years from 1999 with the option to apply for six 5-year extensions. In December 2017, FTSA received a denial of its third extension request. As a result, FTSA can no longer conclude that the remaining three extensions are probable and has therefore reduced its expectation of the total expected life of the concession to the contracted term of 35 years of which 17 years are remaining as of December 31, 2017. This triggered an impairment test of the assets within the joint venture and the shorter time period over which to recover the carrying value of the assets has led to an impairment charge being recorded in the year ended December 31, 2017. The life of the concession is now expected to expire in 2034. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements. 
PeruRail operates passenger and freight services in southern and southeastern Peru. The 70-mile Cusco-Machu Picchu line, carrying mainly tourists as well as local passenger traffic, is the principal means of access to the famous Inca ruins at Machu Picchu because there is no convenient road. Another carrier operates on this line in competition with PeruRail. A second rail line runs from Cusco to Matarani on the Pacific Ocean (via Arequipa) and to Puno on Lake Titicaca, and principally serves freight traffic under contract, an activity PeruRail has expanded by hauling the output of local copper mines in southern Peru to the Pacific port for export. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015—Part-Owned/Managed trains, 2016 compared to 2015". PeruRail can continue to run trains on the track after the conclusion of FTSA's concession. PeruRail, along with other third-party operators, pays a track access fee to FTSA and FTSA pays the Peruvian government fees related to traffic levels and the use of rail infrastructure, locomotives and rolling stock. 
The Cusco-Machu Picchu line connects four of Belmond’s Peruvian hotels, allowing inclusive tours served by the Belmond Hiram Bingham luxury daytime tourist train comprising two dining cars and a bar/observation car with capacity up to 84 passengers. PeruRail also operates a daytime tourist train that runs on the Cusco-Puno route through the High Andes mountains. In 2017, a new luxury sleeper train was launched under the name Belmond Andean Explorer, which runs through the Peruvian Highlands from Cusco to Lake Titicaca and Arequipa. This train consists of 21 carriages, which Belmond owned and operated in Australia until 2003 and sold to PeruRail in 2016. The train was shipped from Australia to Peru where it underwent a full renovation. It carries 68 passengers in 34 en-suite cabins, with two dining cars, a lounge car, and an observation car.

Eastern & Oriental Express: During its operating season from September to April, the Eastern & Oriental Express offers a round trip each week between Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. The journey includes two or three nights on board and side trips to Kuala Kangsar in Malaysia and the River Kwai in Thailand. Some overnight trips are also made from Bangkok to Chiang Mai and elsewhere in Thailand and to Vientiane, Laos. Longer itineraries, up to six nights on board, are offered to places of historic, scenic and cultural interest in the region. Originally built in 1970, the 24 cars were substantially refurbished in an elegant Asian décor and fitted with modern facilities such as air conditioning and private bathrooms. The train is made up of sleeping cars, three restaurant cars, a bar car and an open-air observation car and carries up to 82 passengers. The Eastern & Oriental Express is available for charter by private groups. Belmond manages the train and has a 25% shareholding in the owning company.
Management Strategies

As the foregoing indicates, Belmond has a global mix of luxury hotel and travel products that are geographically diverse and appeal to both high-end individual travelers as well as prominent meeting, incentive, and social groups. Individual travelers in 2017 made up approximately 72% of total hotel room nights, with meeting, social, and incentive groups accounting for the remaining 28%. Belmond’s properties are distinctive as well as luxurious and tend to attract guests prepared to pay higher rates for the travel experiences and high-quality service Belmond offers compared to its competitors.

Belmond benefits from long-term trends and developments favorably impacting the global hotel, travel and leisure markets, including growth trends in the luxury hotel market in many parts of the world, increased travel and leisure spending by consumers, favorable demographic trends in relevant age and income brackets of U.S., European and other populations, and increased online travel bookings. 

Belmond’s aim is to continue to be the consummate luxury experiential travel company, providing guests with a window into authentic, 'one-of-a-kind' experiences in some of the most inspiring destinations in the world. In 2016, Belmond announced a strategic growth plan intended to grow its business by focusing on three key areas:

13


• | Driving top-line growth and bottom-line results at the Company's existing businesses -- Belmond plans to continue owning or part-owning and operating most of its existing properties, which allows Belmond to develop each product's distinctive local character and to benefit from current cash flow and potential future gains on sale. Belmond considers its combined owner/operator role as efficient and consistent with the long-term nature of its assets. Self-management or management with equity interest has enabled Belmond to capture the economic benefits otherwise shared with a third-party manager, to control the operations, quality and expansion of the hotels, and to use its experience with market adjustments, price changes, expansions and renovations to improve cash flow and enhance asset values. The Company continues to emphasize increasing revenue and earnings at its established and recently opened properties, with a particular focus on:


◦ | maximizing RevPAR while controlling costs associated with incremental revenue;


◦ | upgrading core systems to drive greater demand, improve customer relationships and increase website conversion ratios;


◦ | investing in capital improvements at existing hotels and expanding where land or space is available, in both cases when potential investment returns are relatively high and operating costs are low;


◦ | putting a greater emphasis on margin improvements; and


◦ | increasing the utilization of its trains and cruises by adding departures and, for PeruRail, expanding its contracted freight business.


• | Continuing the Company's efforts to build brand awareness -- Many of Belmond’s individual properties, such as Belmond Hotel Cipriani, Belmond Grand Hotel Europe, Belmond Copacabana Palace and Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel, have distinctive local character and strong brand identities. Prior to introducing the Belmond brand in 2014, the Company promoted its individual hotel properties and the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train through the “Orient-Express" sub-brand. In 2014, the Company elected to migrate to more of a "hard-brand" strategy and now markets its collection under the Belmond brand. At the same time, the Company retained its long-term license agreement with SNCF, the French transportation company that owns the "Orient-Express" trademark for the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train. With the decision to introduce the Belmond brand, the Company also entered into an agreement with SNCF to terminate (with effect from December 14, 2014) the "Orient-Express" license for hotel use, without any cost or penalty.

The revised brand and marketing strategy is intended to increase consumer recognition of the broad scope of the Company's unique collection of luxury hotels and travel experiences, thereby increasing repeat and multi-property visits and enhancing revenue growth, and to heighten awareness of the entire portfolio of individual properties among existing and potential new guests. Management also expects this approach will make Belmond more attractive to third-party owners thereby facilitating the strategy of expanding into third-party management of properties that complement Belmond's existing portfolio. 
The Company has made important progress on increasing consumer and industry awareness of the Belmond brand in the approximately four years since its launch. Management believes that there is additional scope for expanding awareness and is focused on building the brand and gaining more market share within the luxury leisure brand landscape. In particular, the Company is focused on making Belmond "the brand of choice" for its specific niche by expanding brand training for employees in order to bring the brand to life for guests while on property, identifying and introducing signature programming that differentiates the Company from its competitors, and utilizing public relations and media opportunities to introduce new experiences while at the same time reinforcing the Belmond brand. In 2017, the Company launched a new global brand campaign and fully re-designed consumer website to support and help centralize these collective brand objectives.

• | Expanding the Company's global footprint -- As part of the strategic plan that the Company unveiled in 2016, Belmond identified global footprint expansion as a meaningful driver of the Company's long-term growth and value. Footprint expansion includes growing the Company's international portfolio through any or all of the following: acquisitions, long-term leases, management agreements -- with or without a related investment, franchise agreements, and construction or acquisition of new train or cruise businesses. Factors in Belmond's evaluation of a potential acquisition, lease, management or franchise opportunity include the property's fit within the Belmond brand and the Company's target geographic markets, as well as an assessment against certain Company's defined financial criteria, with a focus on maintaining conservative debt and leverage levels. In keeping with this conservative approach, the Company intends to partially finance larger acquisitions through the sale of selected assets while generally seeking to retain long-term management of any disposed asset.


As a sizeable part of its footprint expansion strategy, the Company plans to pursue long-term contracts to manage distinctive luxury hotels owned by others principally on a fee basis. These contractual arrangements may include cash, loan or other investment, including key money, by Belmond in connection with renovating or converting a property to meet Belmond's 
14

standards and to align Belmond's interest as an operator with the owner. Management agreements are desirable to the Company in that they would typically be a less-capital-intensive manner of facilitating entry into new markets for Belmond. As owner of many unique and luxury properties that Belmond operates itself, Belmond believes it is well positioned to manage comparable hotels for others.


• | Other strategic considerations -- In recent years, management executed on a strategy to reduce Belmond’s long-term debt position. A number of assets not considered key to Belmond’s portfolio of unique, high-valued properties were identified and sold with proceeds being used to reduce debt, re-invest in other properties, and more recently to repurchase the Company's class A common shares. In the last four years, Belmond sold its 50% ownership in the entity which owned Hotel Ritz by Belmond, Madrid, Spain, the Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond in Maryland, and Belmond Northern Belle in England for combined total proceeds of $87,489,000, and removed any debt or guarantees related to these properties from its consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements. Management continues to review Belmond's portfolio to identify additional non-core assets and expects that any future asset sales would be encumbered by long-term management agreements for Belmond. See Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Marketing, Sales and Public Relations

Belmond invested $3,000,000 in enhanced promotional and marketing initiatives in 2017.

Belmond’s sales and marketing function is primarily based upon direct sales to consumers of travel (prioritizing strategic third-party travel agents, sales representatives and tour operators, and electronic channels such as the Internet and digital marketing), cross-selling to existing customers, and public relations. Belmond has its own global sales force located in 18 cities in the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, various European countries, Australia and Japan, and has appointed third-party sales representatives in ten additional cities in Asia and the Middle East. Belmond also has local sales staff responsible for the properties where they are based.

Belmond’s sales staff identify and train preferred travel industry and distribution partners, engage with group and corporate account representatives, and conduct marketing initiatives such as direct mailings, e-commerce, trade show participation and event sponsorship. Revenue is managed using sophisticated room rate and inventory tools. Belmond participates in a number of luxury travel partner programs, such as the “Fine Hotels & Resorts" and "Centurion Hotel Program", both operated by American Express, and the “Virtuoso” travel agent consortium. Belmond offers its top travel agents and other industry partners "by invitation only" participation in Belmond’s “Bellini Club” providing training courses, special commissions and sales support for all Belmond products worldwide.

Consumer advertising, websites and digital marketing are important direct sales and marketing tools for Belmond. Through its principal website (belmond.com), Belmond provides extensive descriptions and images of the products and guest activities in English and five other languages, in addition to bookings and brand wide promotions. The belmond.com website was fully rebuilt and re-branded in 2017, in anticipation of the launch of a global brand campaign and to support the business objective to increase bookings and revenues through online commerce. Belmond operates other Internet special interest travel portals that direct customers to Belmond’s properties, and works with other selected electronic distribution channels.  Social media such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Pinterest are increasingly significant marketing tools, particularly as the brand looks to reach new markets and to target new customer demographics, including millennials.

Because repeat customers appreciate the consistent quality of Belmond’s hotels, trains and cruises, an important part of Belmond’s strategy is to promote Belmond properties through various cross-selling efforts to engage with Belmond's loyal customer base. These include gifts cards, customer relationship management systems and other customer recognition programs, worldwide preferred travel agent programs, and direct communications with customers. In 2018, the Company will continue to invest in business intelligence systems to further enhance the effectiveness of its marketing and communication strategy to ensure content is tailored, targeted and personalized in accordance with individual customer preferences.

Belmond’s marketing strategy also focuses on public relations, which management believes is a highly cost-effective marketing tool for luxury properties. Because of the unique nature of Belmond’s portfolio, guests often hear about Belmond’s hotels and other travel products through word-of-mouth or published articles. Belmond has an in-house public relations office in London and representatives in 11 countries worldwide, including third-party public relations firms under contract, to promote its properties through targeted newspapers, general interest and travel magazines, and broadcast, online and other media.

Corporate Social Responsibility

Belmond is committed to the implementation of responsible business practices furthering the sustainability of tourism and seeks to ensure that its properties and corporate offices engage with their local communities and environments in a positive manner through their ongoing activities. Examples of these are as follows:

• | Belmond has continued its association with the Sustainable Restaurant Association. The food and beverage operations of all of Belmond's properties will be assessed in 2018 to measure and benchmark their sustainability credentials. Belmond is the first global luxury hospitality brand to have undertaken this third party testing. This testing will continue to inform Belmond's minimum food sustainability, environmental responsibility and ethical sourcing standards during the coming year.


• | In London, Belmond received a Certificate of Recognition from Mayor Sadiq Khan for its "exemplary contribution to volunteering" in the city's Team London awards. Activities in 2017 included volunteering with a local learning disabilities team, introducing a reading and math mentoring program for disadvantaged children, and taking part in several local community initiatives that contributed to the London corporate office's neighborhood being awarded a Britain in Bloom award.


• | In the U.K., Belmond Manoir aux Quat'Saisons supports local community organizations, schools and an animal sanctuary. It is an active member of the Sustainable Restaurant Association and is committed to sourcing local food wherever possible, nuturing and expanding its organic gardens, composting waste, and caring for the environment by, among other things, collecting waste kitchen oils and fats and delivering them to a recyling plant to be converted into biofuel.


• | In Myanmar, the ship doctor of Belmond Road to Mandalay has run community activities along the Ayeyarwady River in a program dating back to 1995. These include a free clinic that treats an average of 2,000 people per month, with plans to open a new operating theater to be staffed by a volunteer surgeon. Among other community activities are the construction and long-term support of 25 schools, and irrigation and solar power projects in remote villages.


• | Our many diverse activities in southeast Asia include supporting a turtle conservation foundation, beach cleaning, and water purification and recycling programs in Bali, supporting an orphanage in Laos, and supporting a water conservation project involving dam construction in Koh Samui, Thailand.


• | In Russia, Belmond Grand Hotel Europe works with local orphanages and youth organizations to support those in need. The hotel supports a house in the SOS children's village outside of St. Petersburg for young people without families, where five children aged between 12 and 15 years old are currently being cared for. The hotel has also introduced a greenhouse program to educate children in growing, and the importance of. fresh organic vegetables.


• | In the U.S., Belmond Charleston Place created and coordinates the Charleston Chefs’ “Feed the Need” Program in which local hotels, restaurants and caterers provide weekly meals in food shelters for up to 500 persons. The hotel also introduced a "Teach the Need" program, teaching hospitality skills to at-risk high school students and helping them find employment. A new program, "Ben's Friends," helps those in the hospitality industry overcome drug- and alcohol-related problems. In addition, every Christmas, the hotel organizes a luncheon for 2,000 disadvantage local people, along with providing gifts such as winter coats.

Industry Awards

Belmond has gained a worldwide reputation for quality and service in the luxury segment of the leisure and business travel markets.  Over the years, Belmond’s properties have won numerous national and international awards given by consumer or trade publications such as Condé Nast Traveller, Travel + Leisure, The Sunday Times (UK) and Forbes.com and by private subscription newsletters such as Andrew Harper’s Hideaway Report, or industry bodies such as TripAdvisor. Among the Company's awards in 2017, Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons was awarded "Hotel of the Year" and "Rural Hotel of the Year" by Food & Travel magazine, Belmond Eagle Island Lodge won a design award for best creativity, innovation and excellence in the "Lodge & Tented Camps" category at the AHEAD MEA Design Conference, and Belmond Andean Explorer received the award for excellence in hospitality design at the New York City Gold Key Excellence in the Hospitality Design award ceremony. The awards are based on opinion polls of the publications’ readers or the professional opinions of journalists or panels of experts. The awards are believed to influence consumer choice and are therefore highly prized.
Competition

Some of Belmond’s properties are located in areas with numerous competitors. Competition for guests in the hospitality industry is based generally on reputation and name recognition, the convenience of location, the quality of the property and services offered, room rates and menu prices, the range and quality of food services and amenities offered, and types of cuisine.

Belmond’s strategy is to acquire, invest or manage only hotels which have special locations and distinctive character, offering unique travel experiences. Many are in areas with interesting local history or high entry barriers because of zoning restrictions.  Belmond builds its competitive advantage by offering high quality service and cuisine, usually with a local flavor. Typically, therefore, Belmond competes by providing a special combination of location, character, cuisine, service and experiential activities rather than relying on price competition.

Belmond’s luxury tourist trains have no direct competitors at present. Other passenger trains operate on the same or similar routes, including the Cusco-Machu Picchu line of PeruRail, but management believes Belmond’s trains and onboard service are unique and of such superior quality that guests consider a Belmond train journey more of a luxury experience and an end in itself than merely a means of transport.
