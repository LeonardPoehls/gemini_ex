OUR BUSINESS
 
Overview of Our Business
 
Technovative through its subsidiaries and viable interest entity is a technology software development company focused in the financial technology industry by providing blockchain solutions and big data analytics technologies to financial service institutions (“FSI”) in the Greater China Region (“GCR”) and the Southeast Asia Region. We are currently developing a suite of smart tools which include Chatbot, Smart Contracts, Data Analytics, Blockchain and Trading Platform targeted to FSI in GCR.
 
Technovative principally operates in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou.
 
Our Products
 
Hedu SmartSuite
 
Hedu SmartSuite is based on four key modules developed by our Company: 1) Artificial Intelligence; 2) Big Data; 3) Cloud Computing and 4) Distributed Ledger Transaction. These modular technologies are developed as a series of software as a service to serve its GCR and Southeast Asia Region clients.

1) | Artificial Intelligence
---+------------------------

 
We are developing an artificial intelligence platform for the consumer market; Hedu SmartBot.
 
Hedu Smartbot is the easiest way for young professionals to manage their entire financial life, from monitoring spending, to saving, and sending money, all from the familiar interface of WeChat platform. Hedu Smartbot uses state of the art machine learning technology to interpret complex data to answer questions in real time.
 
Legacy banking software is unable to cater to the needs of a generation that is used to instant responses and real time interaction. Hedu Smartbot is designed to make it easy for anyone to understand where their money is going, to easily save, or to send money to friends instantly through a familiar interface. The app allows people to securely connect all their bank and credit card accounts and share financial insights via WeChat using natural language to:
 

● | View their spending according to transactions, categories and merchants
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Automatically save money 
● | Send money to friends without sort codes or logging into a bank 
● | Find better deals on bills, subscriptions and financial products 
● | Compare spending habits with those of peers 

 
Typical users are young professionals and graduates who are keen to easily understand where their money is going and to start saving. They are used to using world-class products from Taobao, Baidu and Didi and expect more from their bank.
 

2) | Big Data
---+---------

 
We developed our own proprietary platform, SmartAlytics, which are part of the modular for the SmartSuite and will be integrated on our SmartBot platform.
 
Big data and analytics affect every industry because there is always room for improvement, especially banking and financial services. Big data analytics like Hedu’s SmartAlytics, Banks no longer simply stores data but actively use it in order to generate business insights and add value. Hedu is working with data providers such as Unionpay Advisors and other 3rd parties including government bureaus and e-commerce players, to enable its bank clients to perform for example, in real time to drive immediate decision-making or to score a lead to generate new credit cards. Common use cases where banks and financial services firms are finding value in big data analytics include:
 

● | Fraud detection 
--+---------------------------------------------------
● | Credit Analysis 
● | New Business including secured and unsecured loans

Our platform delivers better experience to FSI clients by engineering data base and analyzing massive amounts of data to get insight of customers for them. We offer intelligent actions which are consulting, constructing and data analysis that improve customer engagement, increase revenue, and lower costs. We help to define a big data strategy and select appropriate technologies and vendors based on client’s requirements and budget. The consultation has a comprehensive view of the many options available and help client evaluates both commercial product vendors and Open Source options. We design prototypes utilizing big data technologies for clients after consultation. On successful validation of the prototype, we construct the big data solution to a production-grade implementation. We also deliver cost-effective maintenance, support, and data analytic service of the solutions.
 

3) | Cloud Computing
---+----------------

 
All of our technologies are delivered through Cloud Computing. We will manage and host clients technologies on cloud servers based on the region the Clients are based on.
 

4) | Distributed Ledger Transaction
---+-------------------------------

 
We have developed our own Distributed Ledger Transaction Technology, also commonly known as Blockchain Technology. We provide a series of turnkey solutions to build up, operating and maintain blockchain related technologies. Existing financial systems require the management of a central account. The balance of each individual is recorded and controlled from a central ledger, and the user is not in control of his own funds. These systems require costly and time consuming compliance and settlement procedures which place an increasing burden on the global economy.
 
SmartCon²
 
Hedu’s SmartCon² can be used to help exchange money, shares, or anything of value in a transparent, conflict-free way while avoiding the services of an intermediary. Industries such as merchant acquirers, credit companies, and data bureaus are beginning to employ smart contracts for tasks, such as real-time project assessments and rewarding and/or penalizing parties for non-adherence to contract.
 
SmartTrader & SmartWallet
 
The SmartTrader is a tool meant to address present exploding needs in wrapping ICO (initial coin offerings) a process in which projects of major interests are wrapped in a digital asset and offered to coin purchasers. The idea around an ICO is that Hedu assists its clients to create a digital coin or token and then offer this coin or token for sale in an initial offering. An ICO is in some ways similar to an initial public offering. Both are done to raise funds, but instead of stock, the ICO purchase gets the buyer a new type of coin or token, an asset rather than a security.
 
The typical use case of a token issued in an ICO is the creation of an asset that gives Hedu’s clients access to the features of a particular project. Instead of having cash as the way to pay for goods and services from the offeror, they use their tokens.
 
The most common place where once the coin is created is to buy and sell on the trading platform exchanges. Exchanges are places where to trade the crypto, using fiat. There are multiple measures to judge the reliability and quality of an exchange, such as liquidity, spread, fees, purchase and withdrawal limits, trading volume, security, insurance, user-friendliness. Hedu provides in this:
 

● | A trading platform to list the digital asset 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A distributed ledger transaction (“DLT”) wallet to buy/sell/transfer
● | A Smart Contract to monitor the projects that the ICO is raised for 
● | A suite of professional services centered around the above

Revenue Model
 
Subscription. The subscription business model is currently the most common way that bots for work drive their revenue. In this model, the bot provides an ongoing service that the user subscribes to and pays for. Most of the features provided by Hedu Smartbot are free — the Company does not charge the user to install the bot for using its core features. The Hedu Smartbot team deliberately do not want to charge for aspects of the bot that promotes usage, engagement, and virality. They do, however, carve out a set of features that are important to wealth management, savings and investment, which payment for a premium service is required.
 
Referral fees. This is another major business model on mobile and web that is moving to bots — Hedu Smartbot can help the users decide what to buy or which service to consume and then refer the users to the right service, rather than actually completing the transaction itself. FSIs provide wealth management, insurance and micro investment are likely to be the partners of our Company.
 
Ad serving. Ad serving has been the bread and butter of many web and mobile businesses. Bots are in a unique position when it comes to ads as they can build a personal relationship with the user, as well as collecting a lot of personal information that can contribute to more personal and fine-tuned ads that lead to better click through rate.
 
Data - analytics and market research. Bots can collect a great deal of data from users. Through engaging in a conversation, bots can learn about user preferences and interests. Those data will be very valuable to our FSI clients.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
Guangdong province and 1st tier cities as the priority 
 
Regionalism is a strong force in China. Cities and provinces sniff disdainfully at one another and implement policies to guard their resources from their neighbors. Every coastal city has to have its own deep water port and every province its own airlines. China is multicultural, multi-religious, and a multiethnic society, having as many as 55 ethnic groups as diverse and interesting as the geography and the history of the country they inhabit. However, the 1st tier cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, due to their long history of connection to the world and enjoying privileged commercial policy from the central government, they have become the metropolitan cities like New York and London, which have developed an internationally accepted norm in conducting businesses.
 
Well established business relationship with FSIs located in Guangdong province
 
Top executives of Hedu has established strong relationship with a number of FSIs in the Guangdong province, as they were the IT solutions provider for those clients in the last 8 years before they founded Hedu.
 
Putonghua and Cantonese are the first 2 dialects for chatbot development
 
China is home to a multitude of languages and dialects, many of which are mutually unintelligible. Spoken Chinese languages are among the most commonly used in the world. The best known are undoubtedly Putonghua and Cantonese. Putonghua is considered a native language by about two-thirds of China’s inhabitants, making it the most dominant spoken Chinese dialect, while Cantonese lays claim to approximately 55 million speakers in China alone.
 
Strong needs from the existing FSI clients
 
The Chinese FSIs face enormous challenges of not only sustaining growth of the economy, but also maintaining their own viability when facing severe competition from the internet giants backed, unconventional financial service providers and the rapidly changing consumers’ behavior. They opt for generating new financial services and products faster, and more importantly to match the right services and products to the right clients.

Service focused migrated to product focused in phases
 
It is estimated that Hedu Smartbot will take 18 months to design and develop, in the meantime, Hedu will continue providing big data analytics and blockchain technologies related services to both of its FSI and non-financial service clients. On one hand, it ensures the Company will have a healthy cash flow and continuously strengthened relationship with the FSI clients, on the other hand, the current businesses provide perfect ground for further development of the existing proprietary technologies as follows:
 
Market Opportunities
    China has leapfrogged ahead to become the undoubted center of global FinTech innovation and adoption thanks to developments across multiple hubs, such as Shanghai, Hangzhou, Beijing, and Shenzhen. The speed, sophistication, and scale of development of China’s FinTech ecosystem have been at a level unmatched in more established markets. In recent years, China’s technology leaders are revolutionizing many aspects of financial services. The scale of unmet needs being addressed by dominant technology leaders, combined with regulatory facilitation and easy access to capital. Underserved by China’s incumbent banking system, consumers and small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are increasingly turning to alternative providers for access to payments, credit, investments, insurance, and even other non-financial service offerings.
 
The willingness of Chinese consumers to adopt FinTech services is just as striking. Forty percent of consumers in China are using new payment methods compared to 4% in Singapore. Thirty-five percent are using FinTech to access insurance products compared to 1-2% in many Southeast Asian markets. There are also significantly higher rates of FinTech participation in wealth management and lending. With high levels of internet and mobile penetration, China is already the world’s largest and most developed retail e-commerce market, accounting for 47% of global digital retail sales.
 
These opportunities came initially from the under-banked or unbanked populations of small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”) and consumers with unmet needs. FinTech firms are also targeting the maturing demands of the burgeoning middle class for wealth management, insurance and private banking. The relationship with Chinese corporates and start-ups is also often very collaborative, helping to fuel the rapid innovation and expansion. FinTech firms are leveraging big data from e-commerce, messaging, search, social media and other internet-based services to personalize the customer experience, provide new services, and leverage operational efficiencies.
 
Global venture investment in FinTech grew by 11% to $17.4 billion in 2016 according to data provided by PitchBook. It is the first time China with $7.7 billion of investment outpaced the US with $6.2 billion. Three out of four financial institutions surveyed view chatbots as a lucrative investment opportunity which should be pursued within the next 1-2 years. As a result, the share of transactions handled by AI agents is expected to grow substantially in the coming years. In the sphere of personal finance, robo advisors are expected to manage about $8 trillion by 2020.
 
Chinese consumers are more than ready to embrace FinTech offerings, creating opportunities for both incumbent and new financial services providers. Key markets are the under-banked or unbanked populations, and the maturing demands of the burgeoning middle class for wealth management, private banking and custodian businesses.
 
Amidst the growing Chinese middle class is a disproportionately large presence of a new segment of digital savvy consumers – the Gen-Y and millennials– who account for 45% of consumption. These ‘digital natives’ are more open to new technologies. They not only exhibit a higher tolerance towards financial risks and greater propensity to spend than the older generations, but also demonstrate more individualized preferences, and demand real-time, hyper-connected, client-centric offerings. Moreover, digital natives are not easily impressed or influenced by the brand, heritage or longevity of traditional banks. Chinese consumers now have higher expectations of the customer experience. They will not hesitate to migrate away from banks to engage with digital disruptors that can better deliver to their financial needs with higher interest rates and fast, convenient services.
 
Chinese consumers are open to sharing personal information online, store payment information in their smart devices and experiment with other forms of non-cash payments. This will be the social foundation for conversational digital banking success

Competition
 
The market for companies that provide FinTech is competitive. Our competitors include i) Ant Financial (Alibaba); ii) Li Cai Tong (Tencent) and iii) Baifa (Baidu) among others. However, we believe that our strengths could put us in an advantageous position against our competitors. Unlike our competitors, we do not simply provide clients with an opportunity to invest through a wealth management platform; instead we also offer our clients a suite of tools which provide the clients with intelligent finance assistance through the Hedu SmartSuite and an interactive communication interface with their customers through the Hedu Smartbot. Our Hedu SmartSuite entirely stands out from other online investment platform because it provides clients with the integration of AI, Big Data, Cloud Computing and Distributed Ledger Transaction to manage ‘Low Cost Centers’ using AI to increase Straight Through Processing (STP) to 100% thus removing cost, increasing customer satisfaction and reducing liabilities when collecting payments internally for the customer. It is one of the examples that Hedu SmartSuite can do with its tools and apps.
 
Additionally, we believe we have an advantage in terms of our location and the market we are targeting. When the industry is growing quickly, the competition between the players are less severe. The AI-powered financial assistant market is still a vacuum in China at the moment. Our direct competitors such as Cleo, Abe.ai or Mindlayer have no market share in China. Therefore, we believe there is an opportunity for us to expand and penetrating the market. More importantly, China is multicultural, multi-religious, and a multiethnic society, having as many as 55 ethnic groups as diverse and interesting as the geography and the history of the country they inhabit. China is home to a multitude of languages and dialects, many of which are mutually unintelligible. Our system is specialized in Cantonese and Mandarin, which makes it easier for us to expand the business.
 
We are also well acquainted with the Chinese culture and are familiar with doing business in China. Top executives of Hedu has established strong relationship with several FSIs in the Guangdong province, as they were the IT solutions provider for those clients in the last 8 years before they founded Hedu. In conclusion, it is not entirely open for new entrants. To compete within this industry, firms need to compete on quality. To achieve this quality, firms need to establish relationships with FSI clients and establish processes to create customization for users. Therefore, it would take a long time for our competitors to gain recognition and a long time to build a strong user base in the China market.
