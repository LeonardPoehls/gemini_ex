ITEM 1 | — BUSINESS.

Overview
We produce and sell thermal coal primarily to investment grade utility customers under long-term, cost-protected contracts. Our focus is primarily on mine locations which allow us to employ dragline surface mining methods and take advantage of close customer proximity through mine-mouth power plants and strategically located rail transportation. At December 31, 2017, our U.S. coal operations were located in Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, Texas, New Mexico and Ohio, and our Canadian coal operations were located in Alberta and Saskatchewan. We sold 49.7 million tons of coal in 2017.
Westmoreland Coal Company began mining in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania in 1854 as a Pennsylvania corporation. In 1910, we incorporated in Delaware and continued our focus on coal operations in Pennsylvania and the Appalachian Basin. We moved our headquarters from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Colorado Springs, Colorado in 1995 and relocated the headquarters to Englewood, Colorado in November 2011.
Today, Westmoreland Coal Company is an energy company employing approximately 2,950 employees. We conduct our operations through our subsidiaries and our principal sources of cash are distributions from our operating subsidiaries. See Exhibit 21.1 - Subsidiaries of the Registrant for a list of our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017, our operations included 12 wholly-owned actively producing coal mines in the U.S. and Canada, a char production facility, and a 50% stake in an activated carbon plant. We also own the general partner of and, at December 31, 2017, own 93.94% of the total equity interest in, Westmoreland Resource Partners, LP (“WMLP”), which is a publicly traded limited partnership that owns and actively operates four mining complexes in Ohio and one mine in Wyoming. The following map shows our operations as of the date of this filing:

Restructuring Activities
On March 7, 2018, we announced that we have retained Centerview Partners as financial advisors and Alvarez & Marsal North America, LLC as restructuring advisors, to explore strategic alternatives to strengthen the Company’s balance sheet and maximize the value of the Company, which may include, but not limited to, seeking reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. We have engaged in discussions with certain stakeholders regarding strategic alternatives to restructure our balance sheet. We continue to retain Kirkland & Ellis LLP as our legal advisor to assist the Board and management team with the strategic review process.
Segment Information
We classify our business into six segments: Coal - U.S., Coal - Canada, Coal - WMLP, Power, Heritage and Corporate. Our principal operating segments for the year ended December 31, 2017 were our Coal - U.S., Coal - Canada, Coal - WMLP and Power segments, however, during the fourth quarter of 2017 we sold all of the assets that comprised our Power operating segment and terminated all related power agreements. Our two non-operating segments are Heritage and Corporate. Our Heritage segment primarily includes the costs of benefits we provide to former mining operation employees, and our Corporate segment consists primarily of corporate administrative expenses and business development expenses. In addition, the Corporate segment contains our captive insurance company, Westmoreland Risk Management Inc. ("WRMI"), through which we have elected to retain some of our operating risks.
Due to the Kemmerer Drop (see Note 2 - Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for details), segment results for all periods presented in the financial statements contained in this Annual Report reflect Kemmerer as part of the Coal - WMLP segment and not part of the Coal - U.S. segment.
See Note 19 - Business Segment Information to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding revenue, operating income (loss) and total assets for each of our segments.
Coal Segments
General
Each of our mining segments focuses on coal markets where we take advantage of customer proximity and strategically located rail transportation. We sell substantially all of the coal that we produce to power generation facilities. The close proximity of our mines and coal reserves to our customers reduces transportation costs and, we believe, provides us with a significant competitive advantage with respect to retention of those customers. Most of our mines are in very close proximity to the customer’s property, with economical delivery methods that include, in several cases, conveyor belt delivery systems linked to the customer’s facilities. We typically enter into long-term, cost-protected supply contracts with our customers that range from one year up to fifteen years. Our current coal sales contracts have a weighted average remaining term of approximately six years. See our segment financial statements at Note 19 - Business Segment Information to the consolidated financial statements. 
Properties
Our proven and probable coal reserves are those we believe can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In determining whether our proven and probable coal reserves meet this economic and legal standard, we take into account, among other things, our potential ability or inability to obtain mining permits, the possible necessity of revising mining plans, changes in future cash flows caused by changes in estimated future costs, changes in mining permits, variations in quantity and quality of coal, and varying levels of demand and their effects on selling prices. The following table provides coal reserve quantities by segment from mines we own or control as of December 31, 2017:
 | Coal - U.S. | Coal - Canada | Coal - WMLP2 | Total 
 | (In thousands of tons)
Coal reserves1: | | | | 
Proven | 316,330 | 274,159 | 108,786 | 699,275
Probable | 1,562 | 19,575 | 11,730 | 32,867 
Total proven and probable reserves3 | 317,892 | 293,734 | 120,516 | 732,142
Permitted reserves | 161,846 | 241,966 | 62,597 | 466,409
Current year production | 18,843 | 22,462 | 6,642 | 47,947 

____________________

1 | The SEC Industry Guide 7 defines reserves as that part of a mineral deposit, which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Proven and probable coal reserves are defined by SEC Industry Guide 7 as follows:

7

Proven (Measured) Reserves — Reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geographic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well-established.
Probable (Indicated) Reserves — Reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.

2 | Represents total reserves for WMLP, of which we are the general partner and owner of 93.94% of the total outstanding equity interests (as of December 31, 2017).


3 | Reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of coal that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by our reserve engineers. In addition, the results of mining, testing and production activities may justify revision of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development of reserves. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ from the quantities of coal that are ultimately recovered.

Substantially all of our properties and assets in the Coal - U.S. and Coal - Canada segments are encumbered by liens securing our and our subsidiaries’ outstanding indebtedness. See Note 8 - Debt And Lines Of Credit to the consolidated financial statements for explanation of defined debt terms below and additional encumbrance details. The holders of the 8.75% Notes and the lenders under the Term Loan hold first priority liens, on a pari passu basis, on substantially all of our and our wholly owned subsidiaries’ tangible and intangible assets (excluding certain equity interests, mineral rights, sales contracts, certain assets subject to existing liens and the San Juan Entities’ assets). The San Juan Entities’ assets are encumbered only by the San Juan Loan (see Note 2 - Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for details). Borrowings under the Revolver are secured by first priority liens on our and our wholly owned subsidiaries' accounts receivable, inventory and certain other specified assets, other than the San Juan Entities’ assets. WMLP assets are encumbered by the WMLP Term Loan (see Note 2 - Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for details). The WMLP assets secure the indebtedness of WMLP and its subsidiaries and are not part of the collateral with respect to the 8.75% Notes, the Term Loan, the San Juan Loan or the Revolver (See Note 8 - Debt And Lines Of Credit to the consolidated financial statements for details).

Coal - U.S. Segment Properties
Our Coal - U.S. segment is comprised of our wholly owned mines located in the United States, excluding our mines held in the Coal - WMLP segment. Mines in our Coal - U.S. segment control coal reserves and deposits through long-term leases. Montana, North Dakota, Texas and New Mexico each use a permitting process approved by the Office of Surface Mining. Mines in our Coal - U.S. segment permit coal reserves on an incremental basis and given the current rates of mining and demand, have sufficient permitted coal to meet production for the periods shown in the table above. We secure all of our final reclamation obligations by reclamation bonds as required by the respective state agencies. We perform contemporaneous reclamation activities at each mine in the normal course of operations and coal production. We deliver coal via conveyor belt to our mine mouth customers and sell coal and lignite on a freight-on-board basis to our other customers. The purchaser of coal normally bears the cost of transportation and risk of loss from load-out to its final destination.
Each of the federal and state government leases continue indefinitely provided there is diligent development of the property and continued operation of the related mines. Federal statute generally sets production royalties on federal leases at 12.5% and 8.0%, for surface and underground mines, respectively, of the gross proceeds of coal mined and sold. Our private leases are generally long-term and have options for renewal. We believe that we have satisfied all lease conditions to retain the properties and keep the leases in place.
Coal - U.S. Segment Customers
In 2017, our Coal - U.S. segment derived approximately 83% of its revenues from coal sales to four customers: Public Service Company of New Mexico (36%), Colstrip Units 3&4 (24%), Colstrip Units 1&2 (12%) and American Electric Power Company, Inc. (11%). We sell the majority of our U.S. tons under contracts with a weighted average remaining supply obligation term of approximately three years.
San Juan. The San Juan mine was acquired on January 31, 2016 from BHP Billiton and supplies the requirements of the San Juan Generating Station operated by Public Service Company of New Mexico. The customer is located within close proximity to the mine and coal deliveries are provided via off-road mine trucks and conveyor belt. The mine’s coal supply agreement expires on June 30, 2022. As anticipated, at the end of 2017 the San Juan Generating Station shut down two of their four units which represents a 50% decrease in sales volume from the mine moving forward. 
Prices under the coal supply agreement includes a fixed-base price per ton delivered for set quantities each contract year, a lower fixed-base price per ton delivered for additional tons delivered in excess of high-priced quantities, and a nominal fixed-base price per ton delivered for coal considered to be delivered from the stockpile existing at acquisition, for which the customer had previously paid for the related production costs. These fixed-base prices are adjusted quarterly based on changes in various cost and commodity indices. In addition to these per ton fees, we receive direct reimbursements for utility costs, leasing costs, and bond premiums. 
We also have separate agreements with the customer for payments related to reclamation activities and ash hauling and disposal. Under these agreements, we receive fixed monthly fees and set payments per unit of activity for reclamation and ash hauling and disposal. These agreements extend beyond the term of the coal supply agreement and we will continue to receive payments for these activities until they are completed. We estimate the completion of ash hauling and disposal activities by the end of 2022, the end of most reclamation activities by the end of 2027, and the end of monitoring costs for reclamation by 2040.
Colstrip. The Colstrip mine has two long-term, cost-plus requirements contracts with the adjacent Colstrip Station power generating facility. These contracts provide for the reimbursement of defined fixed costs, variable costs, royalties and taxes, and any previously unfunded final reclamation costs. We additionally receive a profit component in the form of a per-ton management and incentive fee which are adjusted quarterly based on changes in specific indices. The Colstrip Units 3 & 4 agreement contains provisions for specific returns on capital investments. We currently sell approximately 2.3 million tons to Colstrip Units 1 & 2 annually. In December 2016, we were notified by the owners of Colstrip Units 1 & 2 that our coal supply agreement will terminate three years early at the end of 2019. We do not expect the termination of supply to Units 1 & 2 to impact our contract related to Colstrip Units 3 & 4, which provides for approximately 6.2 million tons per year and currently is set to expire at the end of 2019. As of the date of this filing, we are currently in negotiation to extend the contracts for both Colstrip Units 1 & 2 and Units 3 & 4 beyond 2019.
Buckingham. The Buckingham mine conducts underground room and pillar mining operations in Ohio and has a preparation plant in Corning, Ohio. The mine is strategically located near WMLP’s New Lexington complex, which has access to the Norfolk Southern rail system and a preparation plant strategically located for efficient rail and river transportation of our coal. The Buckingham mine supplies coal to AEP under a long-term coal supply agreement expiring on December 31, 2019 which includes payments at a set fixed-base price per ton delivered for each contract year with adjustments based on quality 
12

measurements. Buckingham’s proximity to WMLP’s New Lexington complex allows us to use substitute tonnage supplied through a contract with WMLP.
Absaloka. The Absaloka mine markets coal primarily in the open market and has several contracts with remaining terms of up to two years with various parties. The prices for these contracts are set at a fixed-base price per ton delivered for each year with periodic adjustments based on changes in certain indices such as diesel fuel. Burlington Northern Santa Fe (“BNSF”) provides rail service to the mine, which also has the ability to load and ship coal via over-the-road trucks. 
Savage. The Savage mine supplies the Lewis & Clark Station and Sidney Sugars Incorporated. Both customers are located within close proximity to the mine and coal deliveries are provided via over-the-road truck. The mine entered into a new agreement with Sidney Sugars in 2017 that expires on July 31, 2021 and with Lewis & Clark Station in 2018 that expires on December 31, 2020. Prices under the Lewis & Clark Station agreement are set at a fixed-base price per ton delivered for each year with periodic adjustments based on changes in electricity costs, diesel indices, depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&A") and CPI indices. Prices under the Sidney Sugars Incorporated agreement are set at a fixed-base price per ton delivered for each year with no subsequent adjustments unless our per ton mining costs are altered by changes in a law, regulation, government order or court order.
Beulah. The Beulah mine supplied coal to the Coyote Electric Generating Plant via conveyor belt and the Heskett Power Station by rail. We continue to provide coal to the Heskett Power Station under an agreement with an expiration date of December 31, 2021 in which payments are based on a fixed-base price per ton delivered, adjusted quarterly based on changes in various cost and commodity indices and quality adjustments. However, we no longer provide coal to the Coyote Electric Generating Plant as their agreement expired on May 31, 2016. Previously, we supplied approximately 2.5 million tons annually to the adjacent Coyote Electric Generating Plant.
Jewett. At our Jewett mine, our customer, NRG Texas Power (“NRG”), terminated our coal supply agreement on December 31, 2016. The agreement was a cost-plus arrangement in which the customer reimbursed us for all costs incurred in mining plus a set percentage management fee. Beginning in 2017, we entered the reclamation phase of the mine life where NRG is required to reimburse us for agreed upon base reclamation costs during final reclamation plus a variable percentage management fee. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we supplied NRG with 3.7 million and 3.4 million tons of coal, respectively.
Haystack. WCC acquired Haystack Coal Company and associated coal reserves in January of 2017.  The reserve area is fully permitted and currently on care and maintenance. No production or development work occurred on the property in 2017.

In 2015 we conducted our Canadian coal operations through Coal Valley Resources Inc. and Prairie Mines & Royalty ULC. On January 1, 2016 these two entities were amalgamated with the resulting entity continuing under the name Prairie Mines & Royalty ULC.
All of our mines in Canada are surface mines, five of which are mine-mouth operations where our mine is adjacent to the customer’s plant. The majority of our Canadian coal production is sold to Canadian utilities for electricity production, with a small percentage being exported to Asia. Our Canadian mines are permitted in accordance with the legislation in effect in the Alberta and Saskatchewan provinces. We secure all of our final reclamation obligations by reclamation bonds as required by the respective provincial agencies. We perform contemporaneous reclamation activities at each mine in the normal course of operations and coal production. Coal reserves and leases in Canada are generally under the jurisdiction of provincial governments. We gain access to the Canadian coal reserves through provincial Crown coal leases, freehold ownership or third party leases or subleases. We believe that we have satisfied all lease conditions in order to retain these properties and keep the leases in place.
Alberta Crown coal leases are granted under the Mines and Minerals Act (Alberta) for terms of 15 years. The leases are renewable for further terms of 15 years each, subject to the Mines and Minerals Act (Alberta) and the regulations in force at the time of renewal, and, in the case of any particular renewal, to any terms and conditions prescribed by order of the Minister of Energy. Crown coal royalties are set by the Coal Royalty Regulation (Alberta). Under this regulation, there are two royalty regimes. The royalty rate for Crown-owned sub-bituminous coal is $0.55 per tonne in Canadian dollars, which is roughly equivalent to $0.44 per ton in U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2017. The royalty rate for Crown-owned bituminous coal, which is based on a revenue less cost regime, is 1% of mine mouth revenue prior to mine payout, plus an additional 13% of net revenue after mine payout. No provincial royalties or mineral taxes are payable on freehold coal.
13

Saskatchewan Crown coal leases are granted under The Crown Minerals Act and The Coal Disposition Regulations, 1988, for terms of 15 years. The leases are renewable for further terms of 15 years each, subject to The Crown Minerals Act and the regulations in force at the time of renewal. In Saskatchewan, Crown royalties in the amount of 15% of the mine-mouth value of coal are payable quarterly pursuant to The Crown Coal Royalty Schedule to The Coal Disposition Regulations, 1988. The Mineral Taxation Act, 1983, levies two taxes against freehold coal rights and production. One is an annual freehold mineral tax of $960 in Canadian dollars per nominal section. The other is a freehold coal production tax, payable quarterly, of 7% on the mine mouth value of coal.
Coal - Canada Segment Customers
In 2017 our Coal - Canada segment derived approximately 86% of its revenues from coal sales to three customers: SaskPower (44%), Trafigura Pte. Ltd. (26%) and ATCO Power (16%). We sell the majority of our Canadian tons under contracts with a weighted average remaining supply obligation term of approximately nine years. 
Genesee. The Genesee mine operates two active pits and supplies the three power generating units at the Genesee Generating Station which are owned and operated by Capital Power. We supply coal from the mine on a requirements basis, via conveyor belt, to the adjacent generating units. Payments are based on reimbursement of all mining costs plus an incentive fee, corporate overhead fee, and an operating management fee. Our mine operating agreement is currently projected to expire at the end of the current mine life through 2055, but the current Climate Leadership Plan from the Alberta government limits the contract to 2030. 
Estevan. The Estevan mine operates four active pits and supplies the Boundary Dam Generating Station (4 Units) (“Boundary Dam”), the Shand Generating Station (1 Unit) (“Shand”), the activated carbon plant and the char plant. The Estevan mine combines the Bienfait mine and the adjacent Boundary Dam mine. SaskPower has constructed and commissioned a carbon dioxide capture and sequestration facility at Boundary Dam and a carbon capture test facility at Shand. This combined project is funded by the government of Saskatchewan with backing from the Canadian government and should mitigate the impact of Canadian greenhouse gas regulations on Boundary Dam. 
We have separate agreements with the customer for each mine. Payments are based on a fixed-base price per ton delivered for each contract, adjusted annually for changes in actual costs and indices, plus reimbursements for certain taxes and insurance. We also receive a fixed monthly payment regardless of tons delivered during the period, monthly incentives if we meet defined stripped coal reserves and stockpile levels, and annual incentives for meeting defined reclamation targets. The contracts include a combined obligation to purchase a minimum of 4.1 million tons of coal each year through 2019 and a minimum of 1.7 million tons of coal each year thereafter through the expiration date of December 31, 2024.
Paintearth. The Paintearth mine operates two active pits and supplies the three power generating units at the Battle River Generating Station which are owned and operated by Alberta Power (2000) Ltd. ("ATCO Power"). We have separate agreements with the customer for each active pit. Payments are based on a fixed-base price per ton delivered for each contract adjusted annually for changes in actual costs and indices, plus reimbursements for certain taxes and insurance. We also receive set payments per unit of ash hauled from the customer’s plant. The contracts include a combined obligation to purchase a minimum of 1.2 million tons of coal each year through the expiration date of December 31, 2022. 
Poplar River. The Poplar River mine operates two active pits and supplies the two power generating units at the Poplar River Generating Station which is owned and operated by Saskatchewan Power Corporation. The Poplar River mine owns and operates the railway from the mine to the generating station. We have a single coal supply agreement with the customer in which payments are based on a fixed-base price per ton delivered adjusted annually for changes in actual costs and indices, plus reimbursements for royalties, taxes, insurance, and other miscellaneous costs. We also receive monthly incentives if we meet defined stripped coal reserves, ash quality or heating quality targets and an annual incentive for meeting defined reclamation targets. The contract includes an obligation to purchase a minimum of 2.3 million tons of coal through the expiration date of December 31, 2026.
Sheerness. The Sheerness mine operates two active pits and supplies the two power generating units at the Sheerness Generating Station which are owned by ATCO Power and TransAlta Corporation and operated by ATCO Power. We have separate agreements with the customer for each active pit. Payments are based on a fixed-base price per ton delivered for each contract adjusted annually for changes in actual costs and indices, plus reimbursements for royalties, lease payments, and other miscellaneous costs. We also receive a fixed monthly payment regardless of tons delivered during the period. The contracts include a combined obligation to purchase a minimum of 2.2 million tons of coal each year through the expiration date of December 31, 2026.
Coal Valley. The Coal Valley mine produces thermal coal which is exported primarily to the Asia-Pacific market via rail and ocean vessel under reserved port capacity. Our contracts are generally short-term, consisting of a single shipment or a series of shipments over the course of a year. Individual contracts are negotiated, generally based on prevailing Newcastle 
14

pricing, with forward pricing of tons locked at a discount and adjustments to the agreed upon fixed-base price based on differences in calorific content from expectations.
Activated Carbon Plant. A 50/50 joint venture with Cabot Corporation, the plant was initially commissioned in June 2010. The plant is located at the Estevan mine and the activated carbon produced is sold to coal-fired power producers for the purpose of mercury removal from flue gas emitted to the atmosphere. Regulations regarding mercury emissions have significantly increased demand for this product.
Char Plant. Our char plant produces approximately 75,000 tons of lignite char per year using coal from the Estevan mine. The char is sold to manufacturers of barbecue briquettes in the U.S.
Coal - WMLP Segment Properties
WMLP is a low-cost producer and marketer of high-value thermal coal to U.S. utilities and industrial users and is the largest producer of surface mined coal in Ohio. WMLP markets its coal primarily to large electric utilities with coal-fired, base load scrubbed power plants under long-term coal sales contracts. It focuses on acquiring thermal coal reserves that it can efficiently mine with its large-scale equipment. WMLP’s reserves and operations are well positioned to serve its primary markets in the Midwest, Northeast and Rocky Mountain regions of the U.S. as WMLP operates one surface mine in Wyoming and four active mining complexes in Ohio comprising thirteen surface mines. 
The Ohio operations include a river terminal on the Ohio River, two washing facilities, two rail loadout facilities and a tipple facility. The mines are a combination of area, contour, auger and highwall mining methods using truck/shovel and truck/loader equipment along with large production bulldozers. WMLP owns and operates six augers throughout its mining complexes. WMLP also utilizes highwall miner systems. WMLP owns or leases most of the equipment utilized in its mining operations and employs preventive maintenance and rebuild programs to ensure that its equipment is well maintained. As of December 31, 2017, WMLP had in place leases or subleases to others for approximately 16.6 million tons of the total reserves owned or controlled by WMLP. We believe that WMLP has satisfied all lease conditions in order to retain the properties and keep the leases in place.
Coal - WMLP Segment Customers
 In 2017, WMLP derived approximately 67% of its revenues from coal sales to three customers: Pacificorp Energy, Inc. (34%), AEP (23%) and East Kentucky Power Cooperative (10%). WMLP sells the majority of its tons under contracts with a weighted average remaining supply obligation term of approximately four years. 
Ohio Operations. The Ohio operations supply coal under long-term supply contracts to two significant customers, AEP and East Kentucky Power Cooperative. The AEP contract has an expiration date of December 31, 2018 and payments are based on a fixed-base price per ton of coal to be delivered with adjustments based on quality measurements. The customer has an obligation to purchase a minimum of 750 thousand tons in 2018. There are multiple contracts with EKPC that have expiration dates ranging from March 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Payments under these contracts are based on a fixed-base price per ton of coal to be delivered with adjustments based on quality measurements. The customer has an obligation to purchase a minimum of 840 thousand tons, 480 thousand tons, and 360 thousand tons in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. 
In addition to these agreements, the Ohio operations provide coal to various other customers under spot or short-term contracts generally based on prevailing market prices.
Kemmerer. The Kemmerer mine supplies the adjacent Naughton Power Station owned and operated by Pacificorp Energy, Inc. via conveyor belt under an agreement that expires on December 31, 2021. Prices under the coal supply agreement include a fixed-base price per ton delivered for set minimum quantities each contract year and a lower fixed-base price per ton delivered for optional tons in excess of stated minimums. These fixed-base prices are adjusted quarterly based on changes in various cost and commodity indices. Naughton Power Station’s Unit 3 is scheduled to be shutdown at the beginning of 2019. The customer has an obligation to purchase a minimum of 2.2 million tons in 2018, 1.7 million tons in 2019, and 1.4 million tons in 2020 and 2021, respectively. 
The Kemmerer mine also supplies various industrial customers including Genesis Alkali (formerly Tronox Alkali - Green River and Grainger) and Tata Chemicals North America Inc. through contracts with expiration dates ranging from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2026. These industrial customers are supplied via Union Pacific rail and truck. Prices under the supply agreements are fixed-base costs with periodic adjustments based on certain inflation/commodity indices.
Competition
15

The North American coal industry is intensely competitive. In addition to competition from other coal producers, we compete with producers of alternative fuels used for electrical power generation, such as nuclear energy, natural gas, hydropower, petroleum, solar and wind. Costs and other factors such as safety, environmental and regulatory considerations relating to alternative fuels affect the overall demand for coal as a fuel.
The majority of the mines in our Coal - U.S. and Coal - Canada segments, as well as our Kemmerer mine in the Coal - WMLP segment, focus on coal markets where we take advantage of long-term coal contracts with neighboring power plants. These mines give us a competitive advantage based on three factors:

• | we are among the most economic suppliers to our principal customers as a result of transportation advantages over our competitors;


• | nearly all of the power plants we supply were specifically designed to use our coal; and


• | the plants we supply are among the lowest cost producers of electric power in their respective regions and are among the cleaner producers of power from solid fossil fuels.

The Coal Valley mine produces coal for export customers, and has contracts with railway and port entities for delivery. The coal is railed to and sold at a port facility on the coast of British Columbia, Canada. The export customers are generally Asian power utilities. Our export customers may purchase coal from us or from other producers around the world with similar coal quality, access to ports, and economical shipping to the customer. Some competitors are located closer to the Asian customers’ facilities.
The Coal - WMLP segment’s Ohio operations do not compete with producers of metallurgical coal or lignite. However, we do have limited competition from producers of Powder River Basin coal (sub-bituminous coal) in our target market area for bituminous coal. WMLP competes on the basis of delivered price, coal quality and reliability of supply. WMLP's principal direct competitors are other coal producers, including but not limited to (listed alphabetically) Alliance Resource Partners, L.P., Alpha Natural Resources, CONSOL Energy, Foresight Energy, Hallador Energy Company, Murray Energy Corporation, Peabody Energy Corp., Rhino Resource Partners, L.P. and various other smaller, independent producers.
Washing Facilities
Depending on coal quality and customer requirements, some raw/crushed coal may be shipped directly from the mine to the customer. However, the quality of some raw coal does not allow direct shipment to the customer without putting the coal through a washing process that physically separates impurities from the coal. This processing upgrades the quality and heating value of the coal by generally removing ash, but it entails additional expense and results in some loss of coal. The Company owns and operates four washing facilities as follows:

• | Strasburg (Strasburg, Ohio): Throughput capacity of 250 tons of raw coal per hour and operated at a 44.5% utilization rate in 2017.


• | Conesville (Coshocton County, Ohio): The wash plant was idled throughout 2017 due to poor market conditions. This facility is adjacent to a customer’s power plant.


• | Buckingham (Corning, OH): Throughput capacity of 700 tons of raw coal per hour and operated at a 98.7% utilization rate in 2017.


• | Coal Valley (Edson, Alberta): Throughput capacity of 1,160 tons of raw coal per hour and operated at a 85.0% utilization rate in 2017.

Seasonality
Our coal business has historically experienced variability in its results due to the effect of the seasons. We are impacted by seasonality due to weather patterns and our customers’ annual maintenance outages which typically occur during the second quarter. In addition, our customers generally respond to seasonal variations in electricity demand based upon the number of heating degree days and cooling degree days. Due to stockpile management by our customers, our coal sales may not experience the same direct seasonal volatility; however, extended mild weather patterns can impact the demand for our coal. We experience the strongest net operating cash flows during the fourth quarter as our sales typically benefit from decreases in customers’ stockpiles due to high electricity demand, which generally occurs during the fourth quarter. Conversely, our net operating cash flows are typically weaker in the second quarter when our customers’ annual maintenance outages are scheduled. Further, our ability to deliver coal is impacted by the seasons. Because the majority of our mines are mine-mouth operations that deliver their coal production to adjacent power plants, our exposure to transportation delays or outages as a result of adverse weather conditions is limited. However, certain of our operations, most specifically our Coal Valley mine and Ohio operations, have exposure to seasonal transportation limitations.

Power Segment
Prior to the fourth quarter sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities in the segment, as well as the termination of all related power agreements, we owned two coal-fired power-generating units in Weldon, North Carolina with a total capacity of approximately 230 megawatts, which we refer to collectively as ROVA. We built ROVA, which commenced operations in 1994, as a Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act co-generation facility to supply Dominion North Carolina Power (“DNCP”). ROVA was held by our wholly-owned subsidiary Westmoreland Partners. All of the tangible and intangible assets of Westmoreland Partners were encumbered by liens securing our 8.75% Notes and Term Loan.
Westmoreland Partners was party to a consolidated power purchase and operating agreement (the “Consolidated Agreement”) with Virginia Electric Power Company, which provided for the sale to DNCP and its affiliates of all of ROVA’s net electrical output and dependable capacity. On December 21, 2016, Westmoreland Partners entered into a Substitute Energy Purchase Agreement (“Amending Agreement”) that amended the Consolidated Agreement. Beginning March 1, 2017, the Amending Agreement adjusted the Substitute Energy and Capacity Purchase Price terms, replacing the latter with a fixed payment and other scheduled pricing through the end of the term. Accordingly, the Consolidated Agreement automatically
terminated and was superseded by the Amending Agreement. At this point, Westmoreland Partners was no longer obligated to operate ROVA in order to fulfill its contracted energy and capacity requirements. Under the Amending Agreement, Westmoreland Partners continued to mitigate its cash losses from generation through the sale to DNCP of substitute power not produced by ROVA. Further, we were required to post collateral to cover certain projected long-term losses under these hedging arrangements based on the market price for power.
As we were no longer required to operate ROVA under the Amending Agreement, we applied for and received approval to deactivate the plant from the PJM Interconnect. This deactivation took effect on March 1, 2017.
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we evaluated our ROVA asset group for impairment primarily as a result of an impairment indicator related to the continued decline in forecasted electricity prices. The asset group was comprised of property, plant, and equipment and related capital spares used to generate electricity. Our evaluation concluded that the long-lived assets at ROVA were impaired, and the carrying value of those assets was written down to zero as a result of an impairment charge of $133.1 million, with the charge included in the Loss on impairment on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Heritage Segment
Our Heritage segment includes the cost of heritage benefits we provide to former mining operation employees. The heritage costs consist of payments to our retired workers for medical benefits, workers’ compensation benefits, black lung benefits and combined benefit fund premiums to plans for United Mine Workers of America (“UMWA”) retirees required by statute. 
Corporate Segment
Our Corporate segment includes primarily corporate administrative expenses and also includes business development expenses. In addition, the Corporate segment contains our captive insurance company, WRMI, through which we have elected to retain some of our operating risks. WRMI provides our primary layer of property and casualty insurance in the U.S. By using this insurance subsidiary, we have reduced the cost of our property and casualty insurance premiums and retained some economic benefits due to our low loss record. We reduce our major exposure by insuring for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of third-party insurance companies.
Material Effects of Regulation
Safety
Following passage of The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, amending the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 ("MSHA"), MSHA significantly increased the oversight, inspection and enforcement of safety and health standards and imposed safety and health standards on all aspects of mining operations. There has also been a dramatic increase in the dollar penalties assessed by MSHA for citations issued over the past several years. Most of the states in which we operate have inspection programs for mine safety and health. Collectively, federal, state and provincial safety and health regulations in the coal mining industry are comprehensive and pervasive systems for protection of employee health and safety. Safety is a core value of Westmoreland Coal Company. We use a grass roots approach, encouraging and promoting employee involvement in safety and accept input from all employees; we feel employee involvement is a pillar of our safety excellence. Safety performance at our mines was as follows:

Regulations
We are subject to extensive regulation with respect to environmental and other matters by federal, state, provincial and local authorities in both the United States and Canada. Regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the following:
U.S. Federal Law and Regulations | Canadian Provincial Law and Regulations 
Surface Mining Control & Reclamation Act of 1977 | Alberta 
Clean Air Act | Responsible Energy Development Act 
Clean Water Act | Mines and Minerals Act 
Endangered Species Act | Coal Conservation Act 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act | Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act | Public Lands Act 
Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act | Water Act

Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 | The Provincial Lands Act 
Species at Risk Act | Wildlife Act, 1998 
Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994 | The Water Security Agency Act 
 | Various other climate change laws and initiatives 

Federal, tribal, state, and local authorities regulate the U.S. coal mining industry with respect to numerous matters, such as protection of air quality, water quality, wetlands, special status species of plants and animals, land uses, cultural and historic properties, and other environmental resources. These laws and regulations have, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on the production and competitive position of the coal industry as against other energy sources. We endeavor to conduct our operations in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. However, non-compliance with federal, tribal and state laws and regulations could subject us to material administrative, civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities, including suspension or termination of operations. In addition, we may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with future laws, regulations or orders as well as future interpretations and more rigorous enforcement of existing laws, regulations or orders, the extent to which we cannot predict. Our reclamation obligations under applicable environmental laws will be substantial. Certain of our coal sales agreements contain government imposition provisions that allow the pass-through of compliance costs in some circumstances.
The following is a summary of various U.S. federal laws and regulations that have a material impact on our business:
U.S. Regulation
18

The change in U.S. Presidential Administration in 2017 has resulted in a number of executive branch initiatives, some of which are discussed below, seeking to reverse the prior Administration’s economic, environmental, and energy-related policies. Because of the uncertainty associated with these initiatives and pending or anticipated legal challenges by states, environmental groups, individuals, and others, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the current Administration’s initiatives on our businesses.
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act ("SMCRA"). SMCRA establishes minimum national operational, reclamation, and closure standards for all surface coal mines. SMCRA requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and following completion of coal mining activities. Permits for all coal mining operations must be obtained from the federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (“OSM”), or the appropriate state agency if it has obtained regulatory primacy. A state agency may achieve primacy if it develops a mining regulatory program that is no less stringent than the equivalent federal mining regulatory program under SMCRA. All states in which we conduct mining operations have achieved primacy and issue permits in lieu of the OSM. SMCRA permit provisions include a complex set of requirements that include, among other things, coal prospecting, mine plan development, topsoil or growth medium removal and replacement, handling of overburden materials, mine pit backfilling and grading, disposal of excess spoil, protection of the hydrologic balance, surface runoff and drainage control, establishment of suitable post mining land uses, and re-vegetation. Permitting under SMCRA and its state analogs has generally become more difficult in recent years. This difficulty in permitting affects the availability of coal reserves at our coal mines. 
Under federal and state laws, a mine operator must also assure, usually through the use of surety bonds, payment of certain long-term obligations, including the costs of mine closure and reclamation of the mined land. The costs of these bonds have fluctuated in recent years, and the market terms of surety bonds have generally become more favorable to us. Surety providers are requiring smaller percentages of collateral to secure a bond, which will require us to provide less cash to collateralize bonds to allow us to continue mining. These changes in the terms of the bonds have been accompanied, at times, by an increase in the number of companies willing to issue surety bonds. See Note 11 - Asset Retirement Obligations to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of surety bonds posted and cash collateral securing these bonds for reclamation purposes. In addition to the bond requirement, the Abandoned Mine Land Fund-created by SMCRA-imposes a fee on all coal produced. The proceeds of the fee are used to restore mines closed or abandoned prior to SMCRA’s adoption in 1977. The current fee is $0.28 per ton of coal produced from surface mines. In 2017, we recorded $5.3 million of expense related to this reclamation fee.
In January 2016, the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management announced a moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands. On March 28, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order on Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth (“EI Order”), which mandated the lifting of the moratorium. On March 29, 2017, the Interior Secretary issued Order 3348, terminating the federal coal-leasing moratorium. 
In December 2016, the OSM published the final Stream Protection Rule to reduce the environmental impact of surface coal mining operations. The rule included the expansion of baseline data requirements and post-mining restoration requirements. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress approved H.J. Res. 38, disapproving the Stream Protection Rule. President Trump signed H.J. Res. 38 on February 16, 2017. On November 17, 2017, the OSM published notice in the Federal Register that it removed the text of the Stream Protection Rule from the Code of Federal Regulations and restored the text of the regulations to that as it appeared on January 18, 2017. The regulations now in effect are those that were in place on January 18, 2017. 
It is our policy to comply in all material respects with the requirements of the SMCRA and the state and tribal laws and regulations governing mine reclamation.
Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and Related Regulations. The CAA and comparable state laws that regulate air emissions affect coal mining operations both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts on coal mining and processing operations include CAA permitting requirements and emission control requirements relating to air pollutants, including particulate matter, which may include controlling fugitive dust. Indirect impacts on coal mining operations include emissions regulations for particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and other compounds emitted by coal-fired power plants. The air emissions programs, regulatory initiatives and standards that may affect our operations, directly or indirectly, include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) Emissions Standards. In August 2015, the EPA finalized standards for greenhouse gases for new, modified, or reconstructed electric generating units ("EGUs") referred to as “new source performance standards” ("NSPS"). The final NSPS for coal-fired EGUs, promulgated pursuant to Section 111(b) of the CAA, require, in most cases, the installation of partial carbon capture and sequestration at new, modified, or reconstructed coal-fired EGUs, which is likely to be a major obstacle to the construction and development of any new coal-fired generation capacity. States and industry challenged the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. 

19

However, on March 28, 2017, EPA filed a motion, pursuant to President Trump’s March 28, 2017 EI Order, requesting that the consolidated cases be held in abeyance pending completion of EPA’s review of the rule and any forthcoming rulemaking. On August 10, 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted the motion, holding the cases in abeyance and requiring that EPA submit regular status reports. The EPA’s most recent status report indicates that “[a]t this time, EPA continues to review the 111(b) Rule, as required under the Executive Order.” (D.C. Cir. No. 15-1381; Jan. 25, 2018). 
Existing coal-fired EGUs were also going to be subject to GHG performance standards. The new standards were set to reduce GHG emissions from the power sector by 32% from 2005 levels by 2030. The “Clean Power Plan,” promulgated pursuant to Section 111(d) of the CAA, would impose stringent standards on existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs that reflect the EPA’s assessment of the “best system of emission reduction” ("BSER"). These existing source standards are implemented by the states, requiring that they meet individual GHG emission “goals” beginning in 2022 with phased reductions through 2030. The final goals have a greater impact on states with substantial coal-fired generation; Wyoming, for example, would be faced with greater than 40% emission reductions from a 2012 baseline. Under the rule, the states had until September of 2016 to submit plans to the EPA to implement and enforce the state-specific BSER, although two-year extensions could be requested. States and industry groups challenged the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and requested a stay pending judicial review. Although the D.C. Circuit denied the stay request, in February of 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the Clean Power Plan pending judicial review of the rule, including potential review by the Supreme Court. The stay delayed implementation of the rule, including the state plan submittal dates. The D.C. Circuit reviewed the rule under an expedited briefing schedule, and an en banc panel heard oral arguments on September 27, 2016. On March 28, 2017, however, the EPA moved to hold the consolidated cases in abeyance pending its reconsideration of the Clean Power Plan, pursuant to President Trump’s March 28, 2017 EI Order. On April 28, 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted the motion and required the EPA to file regular status reports. The EPA’s most recent status report indicates that on October 10, 2017, the EPA “Administrator signed a Federal Register notice proposing to repeal the Clean Power Plan on the grounds that it exceeds EPA’s statutory authority under a proposed change in the Agency’s interpretation of section 111 of the [CAA].” (D.C. Cir. No. 15-1363 Feb. 9, 2018). On March 1, 2018, the court ordered that the consolidated cases remain in abeyance.
Any final rule promulgated by the Trump Administration regarding GHG emission standards will be subject to judicial review. As such, it is unclear whether the appellate process regarding NSPS or the Clean Power Plan will continue. If either rule is upheld in its current form, it is likely that demand for coal will decrease and adversely impact our business.

• | Mercury & Air Toxics Standards. In February 2012, the EPA published national emission standards under Sections 111 and 112 of the CAA setting limits on hazardous air pollutant emissions from coal- and oil-fired EGUs, often referred to as the “Mercury Air Toxics Standards,” or “MATS Rule.” While the MATS Rule generally requires all coal- and oil-fired EGUs to reduce their hazardous air pollutant emissions, it is particularly problematic for any new coal-fired sources. The EPA agreed to reconsider the new source standards in response to requests by industry and published new source standards in April 2013. In June 2013, the EPA reopened for 60 days the public comment period on certain startup and shutdown provisions included in the November 2012 proposal. In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the EPA had failed to properly consider costs when assessing whether to regulate fossil fuel-fired EGUs under the hazardous air pollutant provisions of the Clean Air Act, referring to the agency’s own estimate that the rule would cost power plants nearly $10 billion per year. The D.C. Circuit remanded the rule to the EPA to conduct a cost assessment but without vacatur, allowing the rule to remain in effect while the EPA conducted the rulemaking. On December 1, 2015, the EPA published a proposed supplemental finding that regulation of EGUs is still “appropriate and necessary” in light of the costs to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from the source category. On April 14, 2016, the EPA issued a final rule confirming its “appropriate and necessary” finding to regulate air toxics, including mercury, from power plants after considering costs. The final rule was immediately challenged by several states, companies, and industry groups. Several states and environmental groups also filed as intervenors for the respondent EPA. On April 27, 2017, the D.C. Circuit issued an order holding the consolidated cases in abeyance and directing the EPA to file status reports on the agency’s review of the supplementing finding every ninety days. The EPA’s most recent status report indicates that the “EPA is continuing to review the Supplement Finding to determine whether the rule should be maintained, modified, or otherwise reconsidered.” (D.C. Cir. No. 16-1127; Jan. 19, 2018). 


• | National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for Criteria Pollutants. The CAA requires the EPA to set standards, referred to as NAAQS, for certain pollutants associated with the combustion of coal, such as nitrogen dioxide particulate matter, ozone, and sulfur dioxide. Areas that are not in compliance (referred to as non- 

20

attainment areas) with these standards must take steps to reduce emissions levels. Meeting these limits may require reductions of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions. Although our operations are not currently located in non-attainment areas, we could be required to incur significant costs to install additional emissions control equipment, or otherwise change our operations and future development if that were to change. If our customers are located in non-attainment areas or areas that become non-attainment areas, they may also be forced to modify their operations. We do not know whether or to what extent these developments might affect our operations or our customers’ businesses. 
In 2008, the EPA finalized the current 8-hour ozone standard. In October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the ozone standard further (“2015 Rule”). Several industry and business groups, five states, and Murray Energy Corp. challenged the revised standard in the D.C. Circuit. On April 11, 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA’s petition to indefinitely delay oral arguments in the litigation while the agency reviewed the rule. The D.C. Circuit directed EPA to file status reports on the agency’s review of the 2015 Rule every ninety days. EPA’s most recent status report indicates that it is “continuing to review the 2015 Rule to determine whether the standards should be maintained, modified, or otherwise reconsidered.” (D.C. Cir. No. 15-1385 Jan. 8, 2018).
In a separate lawsuit, a coalition of states and environmental organizations recently challenged the EPA to finalize initial area air quality designations under the 2015 ozone standards. On March 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that the EPA has until April 30, 2018, to finalize the standards for all areas of the country except for the San Antonio, Texas area (which must be finalized prior to July 17, 2018). (N.D. Cal. 4:17-cv-06900 Mar. 12, 2018).

• | Other Programs. A number of other air-related programs may affect the demand for coal and, in some instances, coal mining directly by regulating air emissions emitted by coal-fired EGUs. These include, but are not limited to, the Acid Rain Program, interstate transport rules such as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, the Regional Haze Program, and requirements related to New Source Review. 


• | Effect on Westmoreland Coal Company. Our mines do not produce “compliance coal” for purposes of the Clean Air Act. Compliance coal is coal containing 1.2 pounds or less of sulfur dioxide per million British thermal unit. This restricts our ability to sell coal to power plants that do not utilize sulfur dioxide emission controls and otherwise leads to a price discount based, in part, on the market price for sulfur dioxide emission allowances under the Clean Air Act. Our coal also contains about fifty percent more ash content than our primary competitors, which can translate into a cost disadvantage where post-combustion coal ash must be land filled.

Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and corresponding state and local laws and regulations affect coal mining and power generation operations by restricting the discharge of pollutants, including dredged or fill materials, into “waters of the United States.” Under the National Pollutants Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) and delegated state permitting systems, any discharge of pollutants from a point source into a “water of the United States” requires a discharge permit from the EPA or the state. Additionally, state and local governments regulate nonpoint source pollution through a number of regulatory programs. Under both point source and nonpoint source programs, issuance of permits with more stringent terms and conditions may increase compliance costs for us and our customers.
In January 2017, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the "Corps") issued general nationwide permits for specific activities requiring authorization under Section 404 of the CWA and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. The nationwide permits cover activities that are similar in nature and that are determined to have minimal adverse environmental effects. The permits became effective in March 2017. The Corps reinstated the use of Nationwide Permit 21 for surface coal mining activities. In the event the acreage limits under the permit are exceeded, we will have to obtain individual permits from the Corps which will increase the processing time for future permit applications.
The CWA provisions and associated state and federal regulations are complex and subject to amendments, legal challenges and changes in implementation. In May 2015, the EPA and the Corps jointly issued a final rule defining “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS Rule”) to clarify which waters and wetlands are subject to regulation under the CWA. Implementation of the WOTUS Rule was stayed nationwide in October 2015, and on February 6, 2018, the EPA published in the Federal Register a rule delaying implementation of the WOTUS Rule by two years (through February 6, 2020). States and environmental organizations are currently challenging the February 6, 2018 rule. Continued court challenges and regulatory actions create ongoing uncertainty over CWA jurisdiction and permitting requirements, which could either increase or decrease the cost and time spent on CWA compliance. New reporting requirements and pending litigation associated with coal combustion residuals may cause power generation customers to face increased costs in complying with the CWA, which could impact demand for our products. Finally, in light of real or perceived efforts toward federal deregulation, the prospect of citizen suits to enforce certain provisions of the CWA may increase, which could result in greater regulatory and litigation costs.
21

Endangered Species Act. The Federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), and similar state laws, protect any species listed as threatened with extinction and protect their critical habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) works with the OSM and state agencies to administer the ESA and ensures that species subject to its provisions are protected from mining-related impacts. Protection of endangered and threatened species may cause us to modify mining plans or develop and implement species-specific protection and enhancement plans to avoid or minimize impacts to endangered species or their habitats. A number of species indigenous to the areas where we operate are protected under the ESA and equivalent state laws and regulations. Species in the vicinity of our operations may have their listing status reviewed in the future, however, at this time, we do not believe any of these species protections under the ESA or similar state laws will have a materially adverse effect on our ability to mine coal from our properties.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We may generate wastes, including “solid” wastes and “hazardous” wastes, that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, although certain mining and mineral beneficiation wastes and certain wastes derived from the combustion of coal currently are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The EPA has limited the disposal options for certain wastes that are designated as hazardous wastes under RCRA. Furthermore, it is possible that certain wastes generated by our operations that currently are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes, and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly management, disposal and clean-up requirements.
The EPA determined that coal combustion residuals (“CCR”) do not warrant regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA in May 2000. Most state hazardous waste laws do not regulate CCR as hazardous wastes. The EPA also concluded that beneficial uses of CCR, other than for mine filling, pose no significant risk and no additional national regulations of such beneficial uses are needed. However, the EPA determined that national non-hazardous waste regulations under RCRA are warranted for certain wastes generated from coal combustion, such as coal ash, when the wastes are disposed of in surface impoundments or landfills or used as minefill. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy signed the final rule relating to the disposal of CCR from electric utilities on December 19, 2014, which was published in the Federal Register on April 17, 2015 ("CCR Rule"). The CCR Rule regulates CCR as solid waste under RCRA and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new CCR landfills, surface impoundments and lateral expansions. The criteria include location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post-closure care and recordkeeping, notification and Internet posting requirements. The CCR Rule is largely silent on the reuse of coal ash. In August 2017, EPA released interim final guidance to be used by states developing their own State CCR Permit Programs, under which states may, but are not required to, develop and submit CCR permit programs to EPA for approval. On March 1, 2018, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt issued a pre-publication version of a proposed rule that would amend the CCR Rule. Among other changes, the proposed revisions would allow states or EPA the ability to incorporate flexibilities into their coal ash permit programs. 
Continued changes in the management of CCR could increase both our and our customers’ operating costs and potentially impact their ability to purchase coal. In addition, contamination caused by the past disposal of CCR, including coal ash, could lead to citizen suit enforcement against our customers under RCRA or other federal or state laws and potentially reduce the demand for coal.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA" or "Superfund") and similar state laws, joint and several liability covering the entire cost of cleanup of a contaminated site, as well as natural resource damages, can be imposed upon current or former site owners or operators, or upon any party who released one or more designated “hazardous substances” at the site, regardless of the lawfulness of the original activities that led to the contamination. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the potentially responsible parties the costs of such action. Although the EPA excludes most wastes generated by coal mining and processing operations from the hazardous waste laws, such wastes can, in certain circumstances, constitutes hazardous substances for the purposes of CERCLA. In addition, the disposal, release, or spilling of some products used by coal companies in operations, such as chemicals, could trigger the liability provisions of the statute. Thus, coal mines that we currently own or operate, coal mines that we have previously owned or operated, and sites to which we have sent waste materials, may be subject to liability under CERCLA and similar state laws. We may also be an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been released by previous owners or operators. We may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs of cleaning up facilities at which such substances have been released and for natural resource damages. We have not, to our knowledge, been identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA, nor are we aware of any prior owners or operators of our properties that have been so identified with respect to their ownership or operation of those properties.
Climate Change Legislation and Regulations. Numerous proposals for federal and state legislation have been made relating to GHG emissions (including carbon dioxide) and such legislation could result in the creation of substantial additional 
22

costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. Many of the federal and state climate change legislative proposals use a “cap and trade” policy structure, in which GHG emissions from a broad cross-section of the economy would be subject to an overall cap. Under the proposals, the cap would become more stringent with the passage of time. The proposals establish mechanisms for GHG sources such as power plants to obtain “allowances” or permits to emit GHGs during the course of a year. The sources may use the allowances to cover their own emissions or sell them to other sources that do not hold enough emissions for their own operations. Some states, including California, and regional groups including a number of states in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States that are participants in a program known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (often referred to as “RGGI”), which is limited to fossil-fuel-burning power plants, have enacted and are currently operating programs that, in varying ways and degrees, regulate GHGs.
In addition, the EPA, acting under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act, has begun regulating emissions of GHG, including the enactment of GHG-related reporting and permitting rules as described above. However, as discussed above, most of these regulations are currently subject to judicial review pending the Trump Administration’s review. Demand for coal may also be impacted by international efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. At this time, the extent to which the United States will participate in international climate change initiatives is unknown. 
The impact of GHG-related legislation and regulations on our business, including a “cap and trade” structure, will depend on a number of factors, including whether GHG sources in multiple sectors of the economy are regulated, the overall GHG emissions cap level, the degree to which GHG offsets are allowed, the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources and the indirect impact of carbon regulation on coal prices. We may not recover from our customers the costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements imposed on us due to limitations in our agreements.
Passage of additional state or federal laws or regulations or international initiatives regarding GHG emissions or other actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions could result in fuel switching from coal to other fuel sources by electricity generators and thereby reduce demand for our coal or indirectly the prices we receive in general. In addition, political and regulatory uncertainty over future emissions controls have been cited as major factors in decisions by power companies to postpone new coal-fired power plants. If these or similar measures, such as controls on methane emissions from coal mines, are ultimately imposed by federal or state governments or pursuant to international initiatives, our operating costs or our revenues may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, alternative sources of power, including wind, solar, nuclear and natural gas could become more attractive than coal in order to reduce carbon emissions, which could result in a reduction in the demand for coal and, therefore, our revenues. Similarly, some of our customers, in particular smaller, older power plants, could be at risk of significant reduction in coal burn or closure as a result of imposed carbon costs. The imposition of a carbon tax or similar regulation could, in certain situations, lead to the shutdown of coal-fired power plants, which would materially and adversely affect our revenues.
We are required to comply with numerous other federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations in addition to those previously discussed. Such additional laws include, for example, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act.
Canadian Regulation
The following is intended as a general overview of certain provincial laws and regulations in Alberta and Saskatchewan (the two provinces where we do business), and the federal laws applicable therein to which we are subject and their potential effects on us. We note that the consequences and penalties arising from the application of any of the below listed enactments are varied and fact specific. Accordingly, the summary that follows should not be considered a comprehensive or conclusive assessment of the possible outcomes of a contravention of the legislation discussed below:
Responsible Energy Development Act. The Responsible Energy Development Act (the “REDA”) establishes the Alberta Energy Regulator (the “AER” or the “Regulator”) and sets out its mandate, structure, powers, duties and functions. The AER administers, among others, the following statutes and accompanying regulations in relation to coal mining and related activities in Alberta: the Mines and Minerals Act, the Coal Conservation Act, the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act, the Public Lands Act, and the Water Act. The REDA empowers the AER to carry out compliance and enforcement functions under the various pieces of legislation it administers as well as grants it the power to order the payment of administrative penalties.
Mines and Minerals Act. The Mines and Minerals Act (the “MM Act”), and its underlying regulations, governs the management and disposition of rights in Crown owned mines and minerals. The AER has jurisdiction over issuing exploration authorizations under the MM Act, which any person conducting mining exploration in Alberta is required to obtain in advance of carrying out an exploration program. Exploration programs under the MM Act are subject to investigations and inspections and a contravention of an exploration authorization or of the provisions of the MM Act may result in cancellation of that exploration authorization and/or financial penalties.
23

Coal Conservation Act. The Coal Conservation Act (the “CC Act”), and its underlying rules, applies to every mine, coal processing plant and in situ coal scheme in the Province of Alberta, and to all coal produced and transported in Alberta. The CC Act imposes permitting, licensing and approval requirements on operators of coal mines and coal processing plants. The CC Act imposes certain environmental conservation requirements on mine operators in relation to, among other things, pollution control, surface abandonment, and prevention of waste. Similar to the U.S. bonding requirements mentioned above, the Regulator may require that we deposit financial security to ensure payment of costs associated with suspension of our operations and/or reclamation. Lastly, under the CC Act the Regulator can conduct an inquiry into any matter connected with our Alberta mining operations, the findings of which may result in prosecution for an offense, financial penalties, or injunctions in relation to our operations.
Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act. Under the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (the “EPEA”), and its underlying regulations, the AER is responsible for administering environmental impact assessments, and issuing approvals and other authorizations in respect of certain aspects of coal mining operations in Alberta that have the potential to impact the environment. The specific terms and conditions of an EPEA approval may govern emission and effluent limits, monitoring and reporting requirements, research needs, siting and operating criteria, and decommissioning and reclamation requirements. The AER also administers and enforces provisions under the EPEA that concern spills and releases, contaminated sites, land surface reclamation, and hazardous wastes. The Mine Financial Security Program under the EPEA requires us to have sufficient financial resources for carrying out suspension, abandonment, remediation, and surface reclamation work to the standards established by the province and to maintain care and custody of the land until a reclamation certificate has been issued. The Regulator may exercise broad enforcement powers under the EPEA, including conducting compliance checks, inspections and investigations, issuing enforcement orders, taking enforcement actions, issuing clean-up orders, suspending and/or canceling operating authorizations, demanding cost recovery or charging us for an offense under the EPEA; all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, depending on the specific circumstances surrounding the enforcement action taken by the Regulator.
Public Lands Act. Under the Public Lands Act, the AER carries out its responsibility of ensuring that energy exploration, development, and ongoing operations on public land, including coal mining, are carried out in a responsible manner and in accordance with applicable legislation. The AER amends, maintains, and inspects all land-use dispositions and authorizations for energy activities. The AER also administers the enforcement and compliance provisions of the Public Lands Act, which empower it to cancel, suspend or amend a disposition where its terms and conditions or the provisions of the legislation have been contravened and to issue financial penalties in respect of offences under the Public Lands Act. Similar to contraventions of other pieces of legislation discussed in this section, an enforcement action or a penalty has the potential to constitute a material adverse effect on our operations.
Water Act. The Water Act, and its underlying regulations, requires that authorizations be obtained prior to undertaking construction activities around, and prior to diverting water from, a water body. Under the Water Act, a corporation conducting an activity without the requisite approval or in contravention of the specific terms and conditions of an authorization is liable to a fine and/or administrative penalty, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.
The Water Security Agency Act. Similar to the Water Act in Alberta, The Water Security Agency Act in Saskatchewan and its underlying regulations, requires that authorizations be obtained prior to undertaking construction activities around, and prior to diverting water from, a water body. Under this legislation, a corporation conducting an activity without the requisite approval or in contravention of the specific terms and conditions of an authorization is liable to a fine and/or administrative penalty, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.
The Crown Minerals Act. Similar to the MM Act in Alberta, the Crown Minerals Act (the “CM Act”), and its underlying regulations, governs the management and disposition of rights in Crown owned mines and minerals. The Saskatchewan Ministry of Economy administers the CM Act and the issuance of dispositions authorizing the exploration and development of coal resources in the province. Contravention of the terms of a Crown disposition or the provisions of the CM Act may result in cancellation of that disposition and/or financial penalties, both of which may have a material adverse effect on our business.
The Ecological Reserves Act. The Ecological Reserves Act (the “ER Act”) protects unique, natural ecosystems and landscape features in Saskatchewan through the designation of Crown land as ecological reserves. Under the ER Act, the Lieutenant Governor in Council may make regulations and orders designating any Crown land as an ecological reserve, enlarging any ecological reserve, and restricting the activities which may be carried out on an existing ecological reserve. Designation of either of our Saskatchewan mine properties as an ecological reserve may restrict our mining activities on those properties, or cause us to modify mining plans; however, we do not have any reason to believe that either of our Saskatchewan properties are at risk of being designated an ecological reserve at this time.
24

The Environmental Assessment Act. The Environmental Assessment Act (the “EA Act”) provides a means to ensure that development proceeds with adequate environmental safeguards and in a manner broadly understood by and acceptable to the public through the integrated assessment of environmental impact. Under the EA Act, the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment is responsible for administering environmental assessments, and issuing approvals and other authorizations in respect of certain aspects of coal mining operations in Saskatchewan that have the potential to impact the environment. Similar to the AER’s powers in relation to environmental impact assessments issued under the EPEA, the Ministry of Environment may issue an EA Act approval on any terms and conditions considered necessary or advisable to protect the environment. The Ministry of Environment has broad enforcement powers under the EA Act, including enjoining a development contrary to the EA Act or the terms and conditions of any ministerial approval, conducting investigations, and issuing financial penalties for offenses under the EA Act; all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, depending on the specific circumstances surrounding the enforcement action taken by the Ministry of Environment.
The Environmental Management and Protection Act, 2010. The Environmental Management and Protection Act, 2010 (the “EMP Act”), and its underlying regulations, protects the air, land and water resources of Saskatchewan through regulating and controlling potentially harmful activities and substances. The Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment administers and enforces provisions under the EMP Act that concern unauthorized discharges of substances into the environment, contaminated sites, surface land reclamation, hazardous waste, water quality, and activities around water bodies. The Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment may exercise broad enforcement powers under the EMP Act, including conducting compliance checks, inspections and investigations, issuing environmental protection orders, suspending or canceling operating authorizations, demanding cost recovery or charging us for an offence under the EMP Act; all of which may have a material effect on our business, depending on the specific circumstances surrounding the enforcement action taken by the Ministry of Environment.
The Provincial Lands Act. The Provincial Lands Act (the “PL Act”) creates authority for the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment to carry out its responsibilities in relation to the management, transfer, sale, lease or other disposition of Crown lands, including lands used for coal mining. The Ministry of Environment also administers the enforcement and compliance provisions of the PL Act, which may include cancellation of a disposition where its terms and conditions or the provisions of the legislation have been contravened and to issue financial penalties in respect of offenses under the PL Act. Similar to contraventions of other legislation discussed in this section, an enforcement action or a penalty has the potential to constitute a material adverse effect on our operations.
The Wildlife Act, 1998. The Wildlife Act, 1998 (the “Wildlife Act”) provides for the management, conservation and protection of wildlife resources through the issuance and revocation of licenses, the prosecution of wildlife offenses and the establishment of annual hunting seasons. The Wildlife Act includes provisions to designate and protect species at risk in Saskatchewan, of which there are currently 15 at-risk plants and animals identified in the Wildlife Act. Identification of a species at risk may cause us to modify mining plans or develop and implement protection plans to avoid or minimize impacts to species protected under the Wildlife Act; however, we do not believe that there are any species protected under the Wildlife Act that would materially and adversely affect our ability to mine coal from our Saskatchewan properties.
Fisheries Act. The Fisheries Act, and its underlying regulations, contains two key provisions on conservation and protection of fish habitat that have the potential to have a material effect on our business. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (“DFO”) administers the key habitat protection provision prohibiting any work or undertaking that would cause harm to fish or fish habitat. The Fisheries Act also prohibits the release of deleterious substances into waters frequented by fish. In terms of potential material adverse effects to our business resulting from a contravention of the Fisheries Act, enforcement of the habitat protection and pollution prevention provisions of the Fisheries Act is carried out through inspections to monitor or verify compliance, investigations of violations, issuance of warning, directions by Fishery Inspectors, authorizations and Ministerial orders, and court actions, such as injunctions, prosecution, court orders upon conviction and civil suits for recovery of costs.
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012. The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (the “CEAA”) is the primary federal statute for environmental assessments. The CEAA requires that an environmental assessment for projects that are listed in the Regulations Designating Physical Activities be completed prior to federal authorities making decisions that allow a project to proceed (i.e. prior to issuing certain licenses, disposing of federal lands, providing funding for a project). Projects that require an environmental assessment under the CEAA include, among others, the construction, operation, decommissioning and abandonment, in a wildlife area or a migratory bird sanctuary, of a new mine; the construction, operation, decommissioning and abandonment of a new dam or dyke or the expansion of an existing dam or dyke in certain circumstances; the construction, operation, decommissioning and abandonment of a new structure for the diversion of certain amounts of water; and the construction, operation, decommissioning and abandonment of a new coal mine with a coal production capacity of 3,000 t/day or more.
25

Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999. The Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (the “CEPA”) focuses on the prevention and management of risks posed by toxic and other harmful substances, as well as management of environmental and human health impacts of hazardous wastes, environmental emergencies and other sources of pollution. Certain substances used and/or produced, as well as downstream wastes generated through the course of our mining and processing operations may bring our business under the purview of the CEPA. The CEPA provides the authority to carry out inspections and investigations to ensure that regulations made under the CEPA and the CEPA itself are followed. Similar to the enforcement provisions of other environmental laws and regulations discussed herein, enforcement tools under the CEPA may include warnings, directions to prevent releases, tickets, orders requiring remedial measures, injunctions, prosecution, and financial penalties. Subject to the specific circumstances of a contravention of the CEPA, an enforcement action taken under the CEPA has the potential to cause a material adverse effect to our business.
Species at Risk Act. The purposes of the Species at Risk Act (the “SARA”) are to prevent wildlife species in Canada from disappearing, to provide for the recovery of wildlife species that no longer exist in the wild in Canada, endangered, or threatened as a result of human activity, and to manage species of special concern to prevent them from becoming endangered or threatened. The SARA may affect our operations if a species at risk is found at any time throughout the year on a property in Canada in which we have an interest. As with the protection of endangered species legislation in the US, identification of a species at risk may cause us to modify mining plans or develop and implement protection plans to avoid or minimize impacts to species protected by the SARA; however, we do not believe that there are any species protected under the SARA that would materially and adversely affect our ability to mine coal from our properties.
Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994. Environment Canada is responsible for implementing the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994 (the “MBC Act”), which provides for the protection and conservation of migratory bird populations by regulating potentially harmful human activities. The MBC Act prohibits, among other things, the deposit of harmful substances in waters or areas frequented by migratory birds and a permit must be issued for all activities affecting migratory birds. Any person that commits an offense under the MBC Act is liable to a fine or to imprisonment. A contravention of the MBC Act may result in cancellation or suspension of a permit issued under the MBC Act and a compensatory order for costs incurred by others as a result of a contravention may be issued.
Climate Change Legislation and Regulations. Similar to climate change legislation, regulations, and proposals in the U.S., the direct and indirect costs of various GHG related regulations, existing and proposed in Canada, may adversely affect our business.
In 2016, the Alberta government took steps to implement some of its proposals under the previously announced Alberta Climate Leadership Plan (the “ACL Plan”). The ACL Plan proposed to phase out pollution from coal-fired electricity plants in Alberta by 2030. To that purpose, the Government reached agreements with the three owners of the six coal-fired generation power plant units previously scheduled to operate past 2030. These announced agreements provide for the shutting down of these six units by December 31, 2030. Three of these six units are at the Genesee Generating Station, which is fueled by our Genesee mine operations. Two of these six units are at the Sheerness Generating Station, which is fueled by our Sheerness mine operations. These events will adversely affect our potential business at those two mines post 2030.
The ACL Plan also proposed the implementation of a carbon levy on fuels that emit GHG. The Climate Leadership Act (the “CL Act”) passed in 2016 introduced a carbon levy on all fuels that emit GHG emissions when combusted. Starting January 1, 2017, the carbon levy rate is $20/tonne of carbon emission released by the fuel when combusted. The rate increased to $30/tonne effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the carbon levy, starting January 1, 2017, diesel fuel costs to operate our Alberta mines have increased at all sites except the Coal Valley mine (exempt from carbon levy due to coverage under CCI Regulation described below). Coal sales to power plants and export sales are exempt from the carbon levy. We have minimal Alberta coal sales that are not export sales or sales to power plant customers, on which starting January 1, 2017 we are required to collect and remit the carbon levy.
 Equipment that meets future emission standards may not be available on an economic basis and other compliance methods to reduce our emissions or emissions intensity to future required levels may significantly increase operating costs or reduce output. Offset, performance or fund credits may not be available for acquisition or may not be available on an economic basis. Any failure to meet emission reduction compliance obligations may materially adversely affect our business and result in fines, penalties and the suspension of operations. There is also a risk that one or more levels of government could impose additional emissions or emissions intensity reduction requirements or taxes on emissions created by us or by consumers of our products. The imposition of such measures might negatively affect our costs and prices for our products and have an adverse effect on earnings and results of operations.
Alberta’s Climate Change and Emissions Management Act (the “CCEM Act”) and its accompanying Carbon Competitiveness Incentive Regulation (the “CCI Regulation) (which effective January 1, 2018 replaces the former Specified Gas Emitters Regulation) requires a reduction in GHG emissions intensity for certain large GHG emitting facilities in Alberta. 
26

This system features emissions trading between regulated facilities and allows the use of offsets generated by projects in Alberta. Generally, the CCI Regulation establishes that companies emitting more than 100,000 tonnes of direct emissions in 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 in commercial operation must reduce their net emissions intensity by 12%. New facilities must reduce their emissions by 2% per year, beginning on their 4th year of operation. There are financial penalties for non-compliance for every ton of carbon dioxide equivalent over a facility’s net emission intensity limit as well as for contraventions of other provisions contained in the CCI Regulation. The CCI Regulation is applicable to the Coal Valley mine and also the power plants that are our customers. 
In 2016 the Canadian federal government announced its Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change (the "Pan-Canadian Framework") that indicated that it will speed up plans to phase out Canadian coal-fired electricity by 2030. Subsequently, the Saskatchewan and Canadian federal governments announced that they have reached an agreement in principle that will allow Saskatchewan to continue to use coal in a responsible manner beyond 2030 as long as equivalent emission reduction outcomes are achieved. This takes into accounts Saskatchewan’s entire generation capacity as well as their use of carbon capture and storage. The Saskatchewan government introduced its Prairie Resilience: A Made-in-Saskatchewan Climate Change Strategy (the “Saskatchewan Strategy”) in December 2017. The Saskatchewan Strategy includes principles of reducing GHG emissions without a carbon tax, and using coal in a responsible manner beyond 2030. A final equivalency agreement between the Saskatchewan and Canadian federal governments has not yet been completed. We are unable to predict the impact of these events on our business and it is possible that they may have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows if coal use in Saskatchewan is reduced.
Also included in the Pan-Canadian Framework, the Canadian federal government announced that they would require all Canadian jurisdictions to have a carbon pricing regime in place by 2018. This carbon pricing regime can be a direct price on carbon emissions or an adopted cap-and-trade system. There is no legislation related to this announcement in place for January 1, 2018. Although there is no bill currently before the legislature related to this announcement, draft legislative and regulatory proposals were released in January 2018 for comments. 
Future Canadian federal legislation, including any related to their announced plans, as well as provincial emissions reduction requirements, may require the reduction of GHG or other industrial air emissions, or emission intensity, from our operations and facilities. Mandatory emissions reduction requirements may result in increased operating costs and capital expenditures, or require reduced output. Any failure to meet emission reduction compliance obligations may materially adversely affect our business and result in fines, penalties and the suspension of operations. We are unable to predict the impact of emissions reduction legislation on our business and it is possible that such legislation may have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There is also a risk that one or more levels of government could impose additional emissions or emissions intensity reduction requirements or taxes on emissions created by us or by consumers of our products. The imposition of such measures might negatively affect our costs and prices for our products and have an adverse effect on earnings and results of operations.
