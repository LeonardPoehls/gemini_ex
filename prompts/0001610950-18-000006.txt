Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a leading global biopharmaceutical services organization providing product development and commercial solutions through our clinical end-to-end contract research organization (“CRO”) and contract commercial organization (“CCO”). We offer both standalone and integrated biopharmaceutical solutions ranging from Early Phase (Phase I) clinical trials to the full commercialization of biopharmaceutical products. Our ability to achieve end-to-end solutions is based on our biopharmaceutical acceleration model ("BAM") where we synchronize our clinical and commercial capabilities – sharing knowledge, data, and insights. 
Our customers include large and small to mid-sized companies in the biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. Our revenue is derived through a broad suite of services designed to enhance our customers’ ability to successfully develop, launch, and market products. Our competitive strengths include our broad continuum of clinical and commercial solutions, with our proprietary Trusted Process® methodology leading to faster, better-informed product development decisions, a focused effort on clinical research site relationships, robust data assets, and clinical trial design fueled by patient-centric commercial insights. 
Our organization has been recognized for innovative and best-in-class work. Our Clinical Solutions organization was named the "Top CRO to Work With" among the top global CROs in the 2017 CenterWatch Global Investigative Site Relationship Survey and the 2017 Society for Clinical Research Sites ("SCRS") Eagle Award in the CRO category. In addition, we also participate at the highest level of membership within the SCRS as a Global Impact Partner. Across our Commercial Solutions organization, our consulting business has been recognized by Forbes magazine as one of America’s Best Management Consulting Firms for the past two years, and our communications businesses have won more than 1,000 awards over the last decade. These awards include, among others, the 2017 Medical Marketing & Media Agency of the Year, PM360 Greatest Creators and Trailblazer awards, and SABRE Superior Achievement in Branding, Reputation & Engagement. 
Founded more than three decades ago as an academic organization dedicated to central nervous system ("CNS") research, we have translated that expertise into a global organization with deep therapeutic specialties, as well as full data services and regulatory advisory and implementation support capabilities. Over the past decade, we have built our scale and capabilities to become a leading global provider of Phase I to Phase IV clinical development services. We were established as INC Research in 1998, and our corporate 
2

headquarters is located in Raleigh, North Carolina. As a result of a corporate reorganization in connection with a business combination transaction, INC Research Holdings, Inc., was incorporated in Delaware in August 2010, and we changed our name to Syneos Health, Inc. after our 2017 Merger with inVentiv Health (the "Merger"). The merger of these two companies combined clinical and commercial expertise, scale, data, and insights to facilitate faster delivery of evidence-based medicines to patients worldwide. With approximately 21,000 employees in more than 60 countries across six continents as of December 31, 2017, our combined broad global presence allows us to deliver our services in more than 110 countries, providing our customers with access to diverse markets and patient populations, local regulatory expertise, and local market knowledge. See further discussion in "Note 3 - Business Combinations" to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details on the Merger. 
Following the Merger, effective August 1, 2017, we realigned our operating segments into two reportable segments: Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions to reflect the current structure under which we operate, evaluate our performance, make strategic decisions, and allocate resources. 
Our Clinical Solutions segment offers a variety of clinical development services spanning Phase I to Phase IV, including full-service global studies, as well as unbundled service offerings such as clinical monitoring, investigator recruitment, patient recruitment, data management, and study startup to assist customers with their drug development process. Our Commercial Solutions segment provides customers with a full range of commercialization services, including outsourced field selling solutions, medication adherence, communications (advertising and public relations), and consulting services. Our strategic, insights-driven approach provides our customers with a single source, integrated end-to end solution that spans the entire product lifecycle, designed to increase the likelihood of a successful product launch and commercial profitability. We offer those services in either a full service or individual, unbundled basis depending on customers' needs. 
Our management reviews segment performance and allocates resources based upon segment revenue and segment operating income. Historical segment reporting has been revised to reflect these changes to our segment structure. Prior to the Merger, our Commercial Solutions segment consisted solely of consulting services. For further information about the Company's reportable segments, please see "Note 14 - Segment Information" in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For financial information about our revenue and long-lived assets by geographic area, please see "Note 15 - Operations by Geographic Location" in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our international operations expose us to risks that differ from those applicable to operating in the United States, including foreign currency translation and transaction risks, risks of changes in tax and labor laws, and other risks described further in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, total net service revenue was $1.85 billion, net loss was $138.5 million, Adjusted Net Income was $196.0 million, and Adjusted EBITDA was $391.9 million.

Our Market
The market for our integrated solutions is primarily the biopharmaceutical industry that utilizes outsourced clinical drug development and commercialization services. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the following market trends:
Trends in clinical drug development.  Biopharmaceutical companies continue to prioritize the outsourcing of Phase I to Phase IV clinical trials, particularly in complex, high-growth therapeutic areas such as CNS, 
3

oncology and other complex diseases. Additionally, small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies typically have limited infrastructure and therefore are far more likely to outsource their clinical development to CROs. We estimate, based on industry sources (including analysts' reports), and management's knowledge, that the market for CRO services for Phase I to Phase IV clinical development services will grow at an average annual rate of 5% to 7% through 2020, driven by a combination of increased development spending and further outsourcing penetration. In addition, we estimate that total biopharmaceutical spending on drug development in 2017 was approximately $89.0 billion, of which the clinical development market, which is the market for drug development following pre-clinical research, was approximately $77.0 billion. Of the $77.0 billion, we estimate our total addressable market to be $62.0 billion, after excluding $15.0 billion of indirect fees paid to principal investigators and clinical research sites, which are not a part of the CRO market. We estimate that total biopharmaceutical spending on clinical development will grow at a rate of 2% to 4% annually through 2020. In 2017, we estimate biopharmaceutical companies outsourced approximately $31.0 billion of clinical development spending to CROs, representing a 7% increase compared to 2016 and a penetration rate of 49% of our total addressable market. We estimate that this penetration rate will increase to approximately 52% of our total addressable market by 2020. 
Within the overall Phase I to Phase IV market segment, the Phase IV/post-approval/Real World Evidence sub-segment represents a large area of spending where outsourcing penetration is lower than traditional clinical development and pharmaceutical industry trends are creating increasing demand. 
Trends in commercialization outsourcing.
We believe that, based on industry sources (including analysts' reports), and management's knowledge, that the market for CCO services will grow at an average annual rate of 7% through 2020, driven by a combination of increased sales and marketing spending and further outsourcing penetration. We estimate that the total addressable market for commercialization services was approximately $154.0 billion in 2017, as determined by our analysis of biopharmaceutical selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") trends and related sales and marketing budgets over the past 10 years. In 2017, we estimate biopharmaceutical companies outsourced approximately $24.0 billion of this commercialization spending to CCOs, representing a penetration rate of approximately 16% of the total addressable commercial market. We estimate that this penetration rate will increase to approximately 19% of our total addressable market by 2020, while the underlying biopharmaceutical sales and marketing spending will grow at a rate of 1% to 3% annually during this same time period. We project that over time this market may follow a similar outsourcing penetration trajectory as the clinical development market, resulting in the potential for long-term revenue growth. We believe this potential for growth is supported by: (i) significant biopharmaceutical sales and marketing budgets – generally at least 10% greater than research and development ("R&D") budgets at large biopharmaceutical companies; (ii) a continuing shift toward specialty and more complex therapies requiring more complex and integrated sales and marketing execution and experience; (iii) a robust funding environment, which provides capital to fuel growth in development and commercialization spending, particularly with small to mid-sized companies that wish to remain independent, (iv) significant outsourcing penetration opportunities; (v) an evolving industry landscape illustrated by a shift to longer and more strategic relationships; and (vi) significant downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. 
Increasingly challenging development and commercialization environment. The biopharmaceutical industry is currently facing a number of challenges, including: (i) margin deterioration; (ii) reimbursement and provider access hurdles; (iii) the declining attractiveness of non-core brands resulting in fewer blockbuster and higher profitability drugs reaching the market; (iv) continued pressure from generic brand exposure resulting from expiring patents; and (v) the consolidation of payers, health systems, providers, and pharmacies. These challenges are also making physicians and patients more difficult to engage, making new product launches more difficult. At the same time, the industry is experiencing growing demand for specialty drugs, pressure to achieve improvements in R&D productivity, the transition of the healthcare industry worldwide from a volume-based to a value-based reimbursement structure, and growing political and pricing pressures. Existing approaches to address these challenges include reducing overhead costs, optimizing the deployment of marketing and field assets, and refocusing product portfolios around therapeutic areas with depth of presence and expanded market access capabilities.

Optimization of biopharmaceutical R&D efficiency.  Market forces and healthcare reform, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, the 21st Century Cures Act, and other governmental initiatives, place significant pressure on biopharmaceutical companies to improve cost efficiency. Companies need to demonstrate the relative improvement in quality, safety, and effectiveness of new therapies as compared to existing approved therapies as early as possible in the development process. CROs can help biopharmaceutical companies deploy capital more efficiently as many biopharmaceutical companies do not have adequate in-house development resources. In response to high clinical trial costs, particularly in therapeutic areas such as CNS and oncology, which we believe present the highest mean cost per patient across all clinical trials, biopharmaceutical companies are streamlining operations and shifting development to external providers to lower fixed costs. 
Globalization of clinical trials.  Clinical trials have become increasingly global as biopharmaceutical companies seek to accelerate patient recruitment, particularly within protocol-eligible, treatment-naïve patient populations without co-morbidities that could skew clinical outcomes. Biopharmaceutical companies are also increasingly seeking to expand the commercial potential of their products by applying for regulatory approvals in multiple countries, including fast-growing economies that are spending more on healthcare. As part of the biopharmaceutical approval process in newer markets, especially in certain Asian and emerging markets, regulators now often require trials to include specific percentages or numbers of people from local populations, resulting in a combination of multinational and domestic trials. 
Management of increasingly complex trials.  The biopharmaceutical industry operates in an increasingly sophisticated and highly-regulated environment and has responded to the demands of novel therapeutics by adapting efficient drug development processes. Complex trial design expertise has emerged as a significant competitive advantage for select CROs that have a track record of successfully navigating country-specific regulatory, trial protocol, and patient enrollment barriers, including sometimes subjective, evolving clinical endpoints. In addition, the therapeutic areas where we have significant experience and expertise, including CNS, oncology, and other complex diseases, often require more complicated testing protocols than other disease indications. Many of these studies have longer durations due to these factors resulting in demand for greater clinical trial proficiency and expertise in these therapeutic areas, particularly in light of new methods of testing, such as the use of biomarkers and gene therapy. 
Evolving commercialization outsourcing needs for large vs. small to mid-sized pharma.  Given the increasingly challenging commercialization environment outlined previously, the needs of biopharmaceutical companies are ever-changing. The needs of large versus small to mid-sized customers are developing differently based upon infrastructure and corporate commercialization goals, requiring diverse approaches and capabilities. Large biopharmaceutical companies tend to have more robust internal resources, and are more often seeking to augment these resources with individual services on a brand-by-brand basis. They are also frequently looking for enterprise vendor relationships that achieve broader cost savings based upon volume considerations of their products. Smaller biopharmaceutical companies typically have a limited number of products, and very limited internal resources and expertise for commercialization, requiring the full spectrum of commercialization capabilities, similar to outsourced clinical development patterns. Historically these commercialization considerations may have required small to mid-sized companies to surrender a significant portion of their long-term economic value in licensing arrangements. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that our ability to provide integrated clinical drug development and commercial solutions positions us to address market realities where these disciplines must work together to accelerate the delivery of important therapies to market. Our key competitive strengths are:
Global leadership in biopharmaceutical outsourcing with differentiated positioning. We believe our comprehensive suite of clinical and commercial services differentiates us in the marketplace. We offer our services through a highly skilled staff of approximately 21,000 employees located in more than 60 countries as of December 31, 2017, and have conducted work in more than 110 countries. Over 84% of all new molecular entities approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and 70% of the products 
5

granted marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") over the last five years have been developed or commercialized with our support. We believe our scale, global reach, and breadth of services, coupled with our deep industry expertise and experience, enable us to offer the solutions our customers require to navigate an increasingly complex and evolving market. In addition, we believe our customers are seeking to consolidate their outsourcing to a smaller set of large global providers in order to address changing industry dynamics. 
Innovative operating model - the Trusted Process®. Since 2006, we have conducted clinical trials using our innovative Trusted Process® operating model, which is designed to standardize methodologies, increase the predictability of the delivery of our services, and reduce operational risk. We accomplish standardized delivery through support from a company-wide Project Management Office, which defines, maintains, and improves procedures relating to the Trusted Process® and ensures consistent application globally. Since initiation of the Trusted Process®, we have reduced median clinical study start-up time (defined as the period from finalized protocol to first patient enrolled) on new projects. Based on industry sources for the median study start-up time for the biopharmaceutical industry, we believe we achieve this milestone for our customers at a faster pace than the industry, due in part to this proprietary methodology. In addition to the absolute reduction of cycle times in critical path milestones, we believe we provide greater operating efficiency, more predictable project schedules, and a reduction in overall project timelines. The metrics-driven Trusted Process® methodology is divided into four sub-processes which correlate to the key phases of a clinical project:

• | PlanActivation® — the design phase, where a project is analyzed and a strategy developed utilizing our therapeutic and clinical experience, forming the basis of a customized project proposal. The strategy continues to be refined based on discussions with the customer through new business award;


• | QuickStart® — the initiating phase, which serves to align the customer and our project team to a single set of objectives, create shared expectations and develop a joint plan for project implementation;


• | ProgramAccelerate® — the execution and control phase, which includes the processes of patient recruitment, clinical monitoring and data management. In this phase, we proactively process and review data to ensure quality and project timelines are actively managed, while maintaining strong relationships with investigative sites; and


• | QualityFinish® — the closing phase, which is triggered by the first enrolled patient completing the clinical trial. This phase focuses on ensuring high quality, actionable data is used to develop the final deliverables which make up the basis of the documentation necessary for filing with regulatory agencies.

While initially developed to better manage clinical trial complexity, the Trusted Process® is being actively deployed across our commercial service portfolio to further drive consistency and quality in our integrated operations.
Functional Service Provider Model. Our Functional Service Provider ("FSP") model provides flexible resourcing solutions in the areas of biostatistics and programming, data management, drug safety and pharmacovigilance, medical writing and clinical monitoring. Our model includes a comprehensive plan designed to ensure both speed and quality for operations, relationship management, communication, quality and risk mitigation, and internal processes and tools. We collaborate extensively across functional teams to ensure customer needs are appropriately identified and supported. Additionally, we provide clinical staffing solutions in the areas of contract staffing and direct placement hire.
Adding value across the biopharmaceutical product lifecycle. Our broad suite of services allows us to deliver customized solutions and provide value to biopharmaceutical companies and other key constituents across the healthcare delivery system. We are uniquely positioned to leverage our broad experience and proprietary data assets across our offerings, providing end-to-end solutions that help biopharmaceutical

Our therapeutic expertise is managed by our 
7

senior leadership and delivered by our senior scientific and medical staff and our clinical research associates ("CRAs") within our various therapeutic areas. Importantly, we believe we are unique in organizing our therapeutic business units down to the CRA level, rather than operating with a broader pool of these resources. We believe this therapeutic alignment improves the effectiveness and efficiency of our customers' clinical trials by ensuring that our clinical staff working at our investigative sites have the therapeutic expertise and experience to manage the trial. Industry analysts have reported that therapeutic expertise is the most influential factor for sponsors of clinical trials in selecting a CRO. We believe that our expertise in managing complex clinical trials differentiates us from our competitors and has played a key role in our growth, our ability to win new clinical trials, and our successful relationship development with clinical research sites. We also believe our specialized therapeutic expertise within our Commercial Solutions segment is unique in our industry and becoming increasingly important to our customers as therapies become more complex and targeted. Our experienced medical and scientific professionals include more than 950 employees with M.D.s, Ph.D.s, or Pharm D.s. These employees apply innovative insights and science to clinical trials as well as to the commercialization of products and support customers across both our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments. 
Industry-leading principal investigator and clinical research site relationships. We have extensive relationships with principal investigators and clinical research sites. We believe these quality relationships are critical for delivering clinical trial results on time and on budget for our customers. Motivated and engaged investigative sites can facilitate faster patient recruitment, increase retention, maintain safety, ensure compliance with protocols as well as with local and international regulations, and streamline reporting. The ability to recruit and retain principal investigators and patients is an integral part of the clinical trial process. We have dedicated personnel focused on enhancing clinical research site relationships; we work with these sites in collaborative partnerships to improve cycle times and standardize start-up activities to drive efficiency. 
Diversified and loyal customer base. We are diversified across our segments, deriving 79% and 21% of our net service revenue during 2017 from our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments, respectively. We have a well-diversified, loyal customer base of over 500 customers that includes each of the 50 largest global biopharmaceutical companies (based on annual investment in research and development) as well as high-growth, small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies. During 2017, we provided both clinical and commercial services to 64 customers. We have several customers with whom we have achieved "preferred provider" or strategic alliance relationships. We define these customers as relationships from which we generate significant revenue and where we have executed master service agreements in addition to regularly scheduled strategy meetings to discuss the status of our relationship, and for which we serve as a preferred supplier of services. We believe these relationships provide us enhanced opportunities for more business, although they are not a guarantee of future business. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 22% of our net service revenue in 2017. 
Our customer base is geographically diverse with well-established relationships in the United States, Europe, and Asia. As of December 31, 2017, our top ten customers had worked with us for an average of 18 years. We believe that the tenure of our customer relationships as well as the depth of penetration of our services reflect our strong reputation and track record. We believe we are uniquely positioned to further penetrate our existing customer base and expand our services across the biopharmaceutical industry, as a significant number of the top 50 biopharmaceutical companies utilize both clinical and commercial services. The flexibility and depth of our services enables us to scale our commercialization solutions to address our customers' needs. We connect and integrate clinical and commercial disciplines, enabling biopharmaceutical companies of all sizes to accelerate the commercialization of assets by bringing market access insights into the clinical trial design, reducing complexity, maximizing speed, and enhancing economic efficiency.

Our Business Strategy
Our goal is to generate profitable revenue growth, achieve differentiation in the marketplace in both of our segments, and increase margins through operational efficiency initiatives. We believe our end-to-end product development model, where clinical insights inform commercialization and commercial insights improve clinical trial design and execution, is unique to the industry. The key elements of our business strategy include:
Increase market share through our unmatched service offerings and scale. We believe we are uniquely positioned to meet our customers’ evolving needs as the only provider of a full suite of services through the clinical development and commercialization continuum. Our size and scale enable us to provide solutions designed to accelerate our customers’ clinical or commercial projects, driving speed and cost efficiencies. Our ability to engage customers in the early phases of clinical trials with respect to commercial insights allows them to make more informed decisions on clinical trial design and strategies, which we believe is a key differentiator from our competitors. Our Real World and Late Phase offering acts as the critical bridge from clinical effectiveness to commercial viability. The capabilities to move from development to commercialization require a comprehensive approach that integrates strategic, creative, and operational expertise. Our Integrated Solutions Group ("ISG") is comprised of dedicated industry veterans and product strategists with regulatory, clinical, commercial, and real world expertise that uniquely positions us to help our customers determine the right mix of clinical and commercial solutions needed throughout the product life cycle. Our unique integration of strategy and operations results in multiple selling points along the operational timeline of product development.
We intend to leverage our differentiated service offerings to increase our share of the growing market for outsourced clinical and commercialization services. We believe the need for a full suite of services is particularly strong with our small to mid-sized customers, given their rapid growth and limited internal resources. We intend to capitalize on this market opportunity with existing and potential customers through a variety of channels, but primarily through the consultative sales approach of our ISG. The ISG is a dedicated group of industry veterans and product strategists with regulatory, clinical, commercial and Real World Evidence expertise. The ISG is uniquely positioned to determine the appropriate mix of clinical and commercial solutions to help customers optimize the development process for their products and maximize the return on their investment. 
Leverage our market leadership position in large and attractive markets. Our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments are benefiting from specific industry trends that are expected to drive attractive growth. We believe outsourcing late-stage clinical development services to CROs optimizes returns on invested R&D for biopharmaceutical companies. As business models continue to evolve in the healthcare sector, we believe that the rate of commercial outsourcing may follow a similar long-term path to the clinical development market. Global demand for biopharmaceutical products continues to increase, driven by expanding access to care, increasing life expectancy, and the growing prevalence of chronic conditions in both developed and emerging markets. Higher costs and increased complexity are driving our customers to seek efficiency and expertise through outsourcing services. We intend to capitalize on these trends by continuing to provide the services our customers need. Additionally, we believe that our differentiated approach of investing in highly experienced people, making better use of enabling technology, improving the process of clinical development and commercialization, and integrating our significant data and insights across these disciplines will allow our customers to generate superior returns. 
Leverage our expertise in delivering complex clinical trials and deepen our therapeutic expertise in fast-growing areas. We intend to continue to develop and leverage our therapeutic and operational expertise in delivering complex clinical trials. Our extensive use of insights gained from fit-for-purpose data sources and our relationships with principal investigators and clinical research sites with longstanding patient relationships are especially critical in delivering complex clinical trials. This is enhanced by the use of our proprietary Trusted Process® methodology that reduces operational risk and variability by standardizing processes, minimizing delays, instilling quality throughout the clinical development process, and leading customers to more confident, better-informed drug development decisions. We believe this collective expertise, data, and insights into complex clinical trials uniquely informs our customers’ decisions about their regulatory and payer approvals, market access, reimbursement and formulary inclusion, and other steps that are critical to optimizing their returns in the commercialization process.

Drive acceleration of commercial outsourcing. We have continuously expanded and invested in our commercial outsourcing capabilities and we intend to leverage our extensive knowledge, experience and broad offerings to drive expansion of the commercial outsourcing opportunity with new and existing customers. We believe the market for our full suite of services is evolving based upon the different needs of large biopharmaceutical companies compared to small to mid-sized companies, based upon their infrastructure and corporate commercialization goals. Large biopharmaceutical companies are often seeking broader cost savings through enterprise vendor relationships that leverage their volume of products. However, smaller biopharmaceutical companies typically require the full spectrum of commercialization capabilities, given their limited internal resources. Historically, this may have required these smaller companies to surrender a significant portion of their long term economic value in a licensing arrangement to achieve commercialization. However, with sufficient capital given today’s funding environment, we believe these companies may be more receptive to commercialization alternatives that allow them to maintain their independence. Although we are well positioned to capitalize on the needs of both customer types, we believe that the market dynamics for these small to mid-sized customers will be a key catalyst to driving further adoption of commercial outsourcing. Our ISG is purpose-built to leverage this market dynamic, using our strong clinical presence and relationships in the small to mid-sized customer segment. We believe that having the capability to provide our customers with a commercialization plan may increase their overall success with the sales of a drug once FDA approval is received.
Increase cross-selling with existing customers. We believe that we have substantial opportunities to expand the reach of our services that we provide to our existing customers. During 2017, 64 customers, of which 43 were also in our top 100 customers, utilized services from both our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments demonstrating our belief that there is both market precedent and significant potential to sell additional services to our existing customer base. Given our past success in expanding the scope of services provided to current customers, we intend to further expand our business with our existing customers by cross-selling additional clinical and commercial services. As part of our cross-selling efforts, we market the potential operational and economic efficiencies that customers can achieve by using more of our services throughout the product lifecycle.
Capitalize on our geographic scale. We intend to leverage our global breadth and scale to drive continued growth and target segments of the biopharmaceutical market in which we are underpenetrated. Additionally, we have developed a global platform with a presence in all of the major biopharmaceutical markets in the world and intend to further expand our business outside of the United States. We are focused on replicating our success in the U.S. market to other major biopharmaceutical markets around the world. We have expanded our capabilities, existing relationships, and local regulatory knowledge, which should continue to position us well for new customer wins in a wide array of markets. We have added geographic reach through both acquisitions and organic growth in areas such as Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa, which we believe is critical to obtaining larger new business awards from large and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies. Our long-term growth opportunities are enhanced by our strong reputation in emerging markets and our proven track record of performance. We may also selectively identify and acquire complementary businesses to enhance our services, capabilities, and geographic presence. 
Continue to enhance our Trusted Process® methodology to deliver superior outcomes. We intend to continue the development and enhancement of our Trusted Process® methodology, which has delivered measurable, beneficial results for our customers and improved drug development decisions. While originally developed through years of experience and refinement in our Clinical Solutions segment, we also intend to adapt and deploy the Trusted Process® across our Commercial Solutions segment. We believe our Trusted Process® will continue to lead to high levels of customer satisfaction. 
Continue our proven track record of successfully integrating companies to augment our organic growth. Over the past decade, we have developed a systematic approach for integrating operations. We have successfully integrated ten companies, including both strategic and tuck-in acquisitions. These strategic acquisitions have increased our size, scale, and reach, complementing our organic growth profile as we have become a leading biopharmaceutical solutions organization. Our mergers and acquisitions have enabled us to provide fully integrated clinical and commercial solutions to our customers and expand our global service offerings while also allowing us to achieve significant synergies and cost reductions. In the near term, our 
10

primary focus will be continuing the successful integration related to the Merger, but we intend to continue evaluating selective tuck-in acquisition opportunities that we believe will enhance our services offerings and geographic presence. 
Drive our human capital asset base to grow existing relationships. Our employees are critical to our ability to deliver our innovative operational model by engaging with customers, delivering clinical development services in a complex environment, and supporting and executing our growth strategy. Our recruiting and retention efforts are geared toward maintaining and growing a stable workforce, focused on delivering results for customers. We have a successful track record of integrating talent from prior acquisitions and believe we have a best-in-class pool of highly experienced project management professionals, CRAs, and communications, advertising, and consulting experts. Based on industry reporting, we also believe that our employee retention rates are consistent or better than the industry averages, and we intend to continue fostering an employee-friendly environment that promotes retention. 
Our Services
We provide services through two reportable segments: Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions.

In addition, we have strong relationships with small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical customers that seek our services for our therapeutic expertise and full-service offering.
16

For the year ended December 31, 2017, our net service revenue attributable to large biopharmaceutical companies represented approximately 61% of our total net service revenue and net service revenue attributable to small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies represented approximately 39%. Additionally, we serve customers in a variety of locations throughout the world, with approximately 63% of our 2017 net service revenue generated from customers in the United States and Canada; 25% generated from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; 9% generated from Asia-Pacific; and 3% generated from Latin America. This diversification allows us to grow our business in multiple customer segments and geographies. 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, our top five customers accounted for approximately 22% of our net service revenue. No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of our total consolidated net service revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.
Our top ten customers have worked with us for an average of approximately 18 years as of December 31, 2017. We also have a growing list of "preferred provider" and/or strategic alliance relationships. Further, among the majority of our customers, revenue is diversified by multiple projects and services. For example, during 2017, we provided both clinical and commercial services to 64 customers. We believe that the tenure of our customer relationships as well as the depth of penetration of our services reflects our strong reputation and track record.
New Business Awards and Backlog
In connection with the Merger, we re-evaluated our existing backlog policy for our Clinical Solutions segment. As a result of this evaluation, effective during the third quarter of 2017, we changed our policy for calculating and reporting the amounts of our net new business awards and backlog. Under the new backlog policy for our Clinical Solutions segment, we add new business awards to backlog when we enter into a contract or when we receive a written commitment from the customer selecting us as a service provider, provided that:

• | the customer has received appropriate internal funding approval and collection of the award value is probable;


• | the project or projects are not contingent upon completion of another trial or event;


• | the project or projects are expected to commence within the next six months;


• | the customer has entered or intends to enter into a comprehensive contract as soon as practicable; and


• | for awards related to our FSP offering, only a maximum of twelve months of services are included.

In addition, we continually evaluate our backlog to determine if any of the previously awarded work is no longer expected to be performed, regardless of whether we have received formal cancellation notice from the customer. If we determine that any previously awarded work is no longer probable of being performed, we remove the value from our backlog based on risk. We recognize revenue from these awards as services are performed, provided we have entered into a contractual commitment with the customer. The primary changes made to our net new business awards and backlog policy related to reducing the commencement date requirement from twelve months to six months and only recording one year’s worth of an FSP award. These adjustments resulted in a reduction to our backlog of approximately $284.5 million as of September 30, 2017. We have recorded the backlog assumed in the Merger consistently with our new backlog policy.
We do not currently report new business awards or backlog data for our Commercial Solutions segment. Accordingly, all disclosures related to net new service awards and backlog pertain solely to our Clinical Solutions segment.
Our Clinical Solutions backlog consists of anticipated future net service revenue from business awards that have not started but are anticipated to begin in the future, or that are in process and have not been completed. Our backlog also reflects any cancellation or adjustment activity related to these contracts. The average duration of our contracts will fluctuate from period to period in the future based on the contracts 
17

comprising our backlog at any given time. The majority of our Clinical Solutions segment contracts can be terminated by the customer with a 30-day notice. 
As adjusted for the policy changes discussed above, our new business awards, net of award cancellations, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $1.82 billion, $1.22 billion, and $1.11 billion, respectively. Additionally, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our backlog was $3.80 billion and $1.88 billion, respectively, with prior years adjusted to conform to the policy changes discussed above. Included in our Clinical Solutions backlog at December 31, 2017 is $1.51 billion of backlog assumed in the Merger. We expect approximately $1.88 billion of our Clinical Solutions backlog at December 31, 2017 will be recognized as revenue in 2018, with the remainder expected to be recorded as revenue beyond 2018. 
We believe that our backlog and net new business awards might not be consistent indicators of future revenue because they have been, and likely will be, affected by a number of factors, including the variable size and duration of projects, many of which are performed over several years, and cancellations and changes to the scope of work during the course of projects. Additionally, projects may be canceled or delayed by the customer or regulatory authorities. Projects that have been delayed for less than six months generally remain in backlog, but the anticipated timing of the recognition of revenue is uncertain. We generally do not have a contractual right to the full amount of the awards reflected in our backlog. If a customer cancels an award, we might be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred. As we increasingly compete for and enter into large contracts that are more global in nature, we expect that the rate at which our backlog and net new business awards convert into revenue is likely to decrease, and the duration of projects and the period over which related revenue is recognized is likely to increase. No assurance can be given that we will be able to realize the net service revenue that is included in the backlog. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Our Clinical Solutions backlog might not be indicative of our future revenues, and we might not realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog," and Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - New Business Awards and Backlog" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Sales and Marketing
We employ a team of business development sales representatives and support staff that promote, market and sell our services to biopharmaceutical companies. In addition to significant selling experience, many of these individuals have technical and/or scientific backgrounds.
Our business development team works with our senior executives, therapeutic and commercial leaders and project team leaders to maintain key customer relationships and engage in business development activities. For many of our largest customer relationships, we have dedicated strategic account management teams to provide customers with a single point of contact to support delivery, cultural and process integration and to facilitate cross-selling opportunities.
We use integrated and customer-focused business development teams to develop joint sales plans for key accounts. We also place our business development personnel with strong operational experience around the globe to help ensure project demands are fulfilled. Each business development employee is generally responsible for a specific group of customers and for strengthening and expanding an effective relationship with that customer. Each individual is responsible for developing his or her customer base on our behalf, responding to customer requests for information, developing and defending proposals, and making presentations to customers.
As part of each customer proposal, our business development personnel consult with potential biopharmaceutical customers early in the project consideration stage in order to determine their requirements. We involve our therapeutic, operational, technical and/or scientific personnel early in each proposal and, accordingly, these individuals along with our business development representatives invest significant time to determine the optimal means to design and execute the potential customer's program requirements. As an example, recommendations we make to a potential customer with respect to a drug development study or commercial launch strategy design and implementation are an integral part of our bid proposal process and an important aspect of the integrated services we offer. Our preliminary efforts relating to the evaluation of a 
18

proposed clinical or commercial solution, along with the therapeutic, operational, and technical expertise and advice we provide during this process, enhance the opportunity for accelerated initiation and overall success of the partnership and work.
To drive brand awareness and positioning, our marketing team supports our business development organization through various marketing activities consisting primarily of market and competitive analysis, brand management, market information and collateral development, participation in industry conferences, content-driven thought leadership advertising, e-marketing, publications, and website development and maintenance.
As part of the Syneos Health brand launch, a significant investment has been made to carve out a differentiated positioning based on our unique Biopharmaceutical Acceleration Model where clinical insights inform commercialization and commercial insights inform clinical trial design. From our brand identity that delivers on our ability to “sync” clinical and commercial solutions, to our proprietary tagline, “Shortening the Distance from Lab to Life™,” to curated customer content including commercialization trends impacting real-time outsourcing solutions, all marketing efforts are delivered through multi-channel platforms to reach the right customers at the right time. Over time and with enhanced education and reinforcement, we are confident that brand recognition and our unique value proposition will position us as a preferred strategic outsourcing partner.

• | overall value.

Notwithstanding these competitive factors, we believe that our deep therapeutic expertise, global reach and operational strengths differentiate us from our competitors across both of our segments.
Government Regulation
The biopharmaceutical industry is subject to a high degree of governmental regulation in both domestic and international markets. Regardless of the country or region in which approval is being sought, before a marketing application for a drug is ready for submission to regulatory authorities, the candidate drug must undergo rigorous testing in clinical trials. The clinical trial process must be conducted in accordance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in the United States and similar laws and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations require the drug to be tested and studied in certain ways prior to submission for approval. 
Regulation of Our Clinical Solutions Segment 
In the United States, the FDA regulates the conduct of clinical trials of drug products in human subjects, and the form and content of regulatory applications. The FDA also regulates the development, approval, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, and marketing of drug products. The FDA has similar authority and similar requirements with respect to the clinical testing of biological products and medical devices. In the EU and other jurisdictions where our customers intend to apply for marketing authorization, similar laws and regulations apply. Within the EU, these requirements are enforced by the EMA, and requirements vary slightly from one member state to another. In Canada, clinical trials are regulated by the Health Products Food Branch of Health Canada as well as provincial regulations. Similar requirements also apply in other jurisdictions, including Australia, Japan, and other Asian countries, where we operate or where our customers intend to apply for marketing authorization. Sponsors of clinical trials also follow the ICH GCP guidelines. An addendum to the ICH GCP Guidelines was adopted by the ICH committee in November 2016 and will now be implemented through national and regional guidance in ICH member states. The changes aim to encourage sponsors to implement improved oversight and management of clinical trials, utilizing a Quality Risk Management approach while continuing to ensure protection of human subjects participating in trials and clinical trial data integrity.
20

Our services are subject to various regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the clinical trial process. In the United States, we must perform our clinical development services in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including GCP, which govern, among other things, the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials. Before a human clinical trial may begin, the manufacturer or sponsor of the clinical product candidate must file an investigational new drug application ("IND") with the FDA, which contains, among other things, the results of preclinical tests, manufacturer information, and other analytical data. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Each clinical trial must be conducted pursuant to, and in accordance with, an effective IND. In addition, under GCP, each human clinical trial we conduct is subject to the oversight of an independent institutional review board ("IRB") which is an independent committee that has the regulatory authority to review, approve and monitor a clinical trial. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Clinical trials conducted outside the United States are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where the trials are conducted. These laws and regulations might not be similar to the laws and regulations administered by the FDA and other laws and regulations regarding the protection of patient safety and privacy and the control of study pharmaceuticals, medical devices or other study materials. Studies conducted outside the United States can also be subject to regulation by the FDA if the studies are conducted pursuant to an IND or an investigational device exemption for a product candidate that will seek FDA approval or clearance. It is the responsibility of the study sponsor or the parties conducting the studies to ensure that all applicable legal and regulatory requirements are fulfilled.
In order to comply with GCP and other regulations, we must, among other things:

• | comply with specific requirements governing the selection of qualified principal investigators and clinical research sites;


• | obtain specific written commitments from principal investigators;


• | obtain review, approval and supervision of the clinical trials by an IRB or ethics committee;


• | obtain favorable opinion from regulatory agencies to commence a clinical trial;


• | verify that appropriate patient informed consents are obtained before the patient participates in a clinical trial;


• | ensure that adverse drug reactions resulting from the administration of a drug or biologic during a clinical trial are medically evaluated and reported in a timely manner;


• | monitor the validity and accuracy of data;


• | monitor drug or biologic accountability at clinical research sites; and


• | verify that principal investigators and study staff maintain records and reports and permit appropriate governmental authorities access to data for review.

Similar guidelines exist in various states and in other countries. We may be subject to regulatory action if we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations. Failure to comply with certain regulations can also result in the termination of ongoing research and disqualification of data collected during the clinical trials. For example, violations of GCP could result, depending on the nature of the violation and the type of product involved, in the issuance of a warning letter, suspension or termination of a clinical study, refusal of the FDA to approve clinical trial or marketing applications or withdrawal of such applications, injunction, seizure of investigational products, civil penalties, criminal prosecutions, or debarment from assisting in the submission of new drug applications. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements, regulatory standards and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We monitor our clinical trials to test for compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the United States and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have adopted standard operating procedures that are 
21

designed to satisfy regulatory requirements and serve as a mechanism for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials. In the United States, our procedures were developed to ensure compliance with GCP and associated guidelines.
In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers might be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. Furthermore, certain employees might have to receive initial and periodic training to ensure compliance with applicable hazardous materials regulations and health and safety guidelines. We are subject to similar regulations in Canada and Spain.
Regulation of Our Commercial Solutions Segment
Our field personnel are subject to all laws, rules and regulations governing the promotion of pharmaceutical products in the United States and in every other country where such personnel performs work. In particular, these rules and regulations include limitations on the indications for which a product may be promoted and on promotional spending. Violations of these rules may leave us at risk of direct regulatory enforcement action and/or cause us to be in breach of contract with our customers. 
Some of our field personnel handle and distribute samples of pharmaceutical products. In the United States, the handling and distribution of prescription drug products are subject to regulation under the Prescription Drug Marketing Act and other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations and other countries may have similar laws or regulations. These laws and regulations regulate the distribution of drug samples by mandating procedures for storage and record-keeping requirements for drug samples and ban the purchase or sale of drug samples. Further, companies holding or distributing controlled substances are subject to regulation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. 
Our communications solutions offerings are subject to all regulatory risks applicable to similar communications businesses as well as risks that relate specifically to the provision of these services to the biopharmaceutical industry. Such regulatory risks include enforcement by the FDA, Health Canada, the Department of Health in the United Kingdom, EMA and the Federal Trade Commission as well as state agencies and other foreign regulators enforcing laws relating to product advertising, false advertising, and unfair and deceptive trade practices. In addition to enforcement actions initiated by government agencies, there has been an increasing tendency in the United States among biopharmaceutical companies to resort to the courts and industry and self-regulatory bodies to challenge comparative prescription drug advertising on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive. There continues to be an expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products.
Regulation of Patient Information
The confidentiality of patient-specific information and records and the circumstances under which such patient-specific information and records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business are heavily regulated. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has promulgated rules under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act in connection with the application of security and privacy provisions under the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (collectively, "HIPAA"). These regulations govern the use, handling and disclosure of personally identifiable medical information and require the use of standard transactions, privacy and security standards and other administrative simplification provisions by covered entities, which include many healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. Although we do not consider that our business activities generally cause us to be subject to HIPAA as a directly covered entity, we endeavor to embrace sound identity protection practices. These regulations also establish procedures for the exercise of an individual's rights and the methods permissible for de-identification of health information. We are also subject to privacy legislation in Canada under the federal Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act, the Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector and the Personal Health Information Protection Act, and privacy legislation in the EU under the 95/46/EC Privacy Directive on the protection and free movement of personal data.

Intellectual Property
We develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements to protect our trade secrets, and copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights. We have obtained or applied for trademarks and copyright protection in the United States and in a number of foreign countries. Our material trademarks include Trusted Process®, PlanActivation®, QuickStart®, ProgramAccelerate®, QualityFinish®, "Shortening the distance from lab to life™, Syneos Health, Inc., and other corporate emblems. Although the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country, trademarks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and so long as they have not been found to have become generic. Although we believe the ownership of trademarks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, we rely primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our employees. We do not have any material licenses, franchises or concessions.
Employees
The level of competition among employers in the United States and overseas for skilled personnel is high. We believe that our brand recognition and our multinational presence are advantages in attracting qualified candidates. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 21,000 employees worldwide, with approximately 58% located in the United States and Canada, 22% in Europe, 16% in Asia-Pacific, 3% in Latin America and 1% in the Middle East and Africa. The majority of our employees are employed on a full-time basis. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe our overall relations with our employees are good. Employees in certain of our non-U.S. locations are represented by workers' councils as required by local laws. 
Indemnification and Insurance 
In conjunction with our Clinical Solutions services, we employ or contract with research institutions and, in some jurisdictions, principal investigators and pharmacies on behalf of biopharmaceutical companies to serve as research centers and principal investigators in conducting clinical trials to test new drugs on human volunteers. Such testing creates the risk of liability for personal injury or death of volunteers, particularly to volunteers with life-threatening illnesses, resulting from adverse reactions to the drugs administered. It is possible that we could be held liable for claims and expenses arising from any professional malpractice of the principal investigators with whom we contract or engage, or in the event of personal injury to or death of persons participating in clinical trials. In addition, as a result of our operation of Phase I clinical trial facilities, we could be liable for the general risks associated with clinical trials including, but not limited to, adverse events resulting from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of medical care providers. We also could be held liable for errors or omissions in connection with the services we perform through each of our service groups. For example, we could be held liable for errors, omissions, or breach of contract, if monitoring obligations have been transferred to us and one of our CRA's inaccurately reports from source documents or fails to adequately monitor a human clinical trial resulting in inaccurately recorded results.
We have sought to reduce our risks by implementing the following where practicable:

• | securing contractual assurances such as indemnification provisions and provisions seeking to limit or exclude liability contained in our contracts with customers, institutions, pharmacies, vendors and principal investigators;


• | securing contractual and other assurances that adequate insurance will be maintained to the extent applicable by customers, institutions, pharmacies, vendors, principal investigators and us; and

23


• | complying with various regulatory requirements, including monitoring that the oversight of independent review boards and ethics committees are intact where obligations are transferred to us and monitoring the oversight of the procurement by the principal investigator of each participant's informed consent to participate in the study.

Our contractual indemnifications generally do not fully protect us against certain of our own actions, such as negligence. Contractual arrangements are subject to negotiation with customers, and the terms and scope of any indemnification, limitation of liability or exclusion of liability varies from customer to customer and from trial to trial. Additionally, financial performance of these indemnities is not secured. Therefore, we bear the risk that any indemnifying party against which we have claims may not have the financial ability to fulfill its indemnification obligations to us.
While we maintain a global insurance program including professional liability and other types of insurance standard to our industry to cover our liability while conducting our business activities and contracted services, including drug safety issues as well as data processing and other errors and omissions, it is possible that we could become subject to claims not covered by insurance or that exceed our coverage limits. We could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside the scope of, or in excess of, a contractual indemnification provision, beyond the level of insurance coverage or not covered by insurance, or in the event that an indemnifying party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations.
