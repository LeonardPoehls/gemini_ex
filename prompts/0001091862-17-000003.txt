Item 1: Business
When we use the terms “Corporation,” “Company,” “Chemtura,” “Registrant,” “We,” “Us” and “Our,” unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, we are referring to Chemtura Corporation and our consolidated subsidiaries. 
PENDING MERGER TRANSACTION WITH LANXESS
On February 1, 2017, Chemtura's stockholders voted to approve and adopt the agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") we entered into on September 25, 2016 with Lanxess Deutschland GmbH, a limited liability company under the laws of Germany ("Lanxess"), and LANXESS Additives Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Lanxess ("Merger Subsidiary"). Upon the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into Chemtura (the "Merger"), with Chemtura surviving the merger in an all-cash transaction in which Chemtura's stockholders will receive $33.50 in cash, without interest, per share of Chemtura common stock, which represented an 18.9% premium to the stock’s closing share price of $28.18 on September 23, 2016, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger.
The Merger remains subject to customary closing conditions including, among others, the receipt of necessary antitrust and regulatory approvals and the accuracy of representations and warranties made in the Merger Agreement. Assuming timely satisfaction of the necessary closing conditions, we currently expect the Merger to close by mid-2017.
Until the Merger has occurred, we will continue to operate as an autonomous company from Lanxess. This Annual Report on Form 10-K has been written based upon that premise. However, as a direct result of the Merger, changes to our common stock, strategic initiatives, structure, markets or locations may occur that would not have occurred if we were to continue as an independent entity.
For a further discussion of the Merger, see Note 2 — Mergers and Divestitures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

PREVIOUSLY DIVESTED BUSINESSES
Chemtura AgroSolutions Business
In November 2014, we sold our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform Specialty Products Corporation (“Platform”). Under the terms of the sale, we retained most of the property, plant and equipment used to manufacture products for the Chemtura AgroSolutions business and will continue to manufacture products for Platform under several supply agreements and a tolling agreement (collectively, the “supply agreements”) with minimum terms between two and four years. The supply agreements include contractual obligations to continue to supply for a period of up to 2 years after the termination of the supply agreement. The Agrochemical Manufacturing segment represents the results of operations for the Chemtura AgroSolutions business prior to the sale and, since the date of the sale, the ongoing operations under the supply agreements. Contemporaneous with the sale, we no longer market the Chemtura AgroSolutions business products to third parties.
Information related to the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business and financial information related to the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment can be found in Note 2 - Mergers and Divestitures and Note 16 - Business Segments in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Divestitures Reported as Discontinued Operations
In 2013, we sold our subsidiaries that constituted our Consumer Products business to KIK Custom Products Inc. (“KIK”) and we sold our Antioxidant business to SK Blue Holdings, Ltd. (“SK”), an affiliate of SK Capital Partners III, L.P. During 2014 and 2015, we continued to finalize and complete certain closing terms under the sale agreements, including the customary settlement of working capital.
For further discussion of these divestitures, see Note 2 - Mergers and Divestitures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sources of Raw Materials
Hydrocarbon-based and inorganic chemicals constitute the majority of the raw materials required to manufacture our products. These materials are generally available from a number of sources. We use significant amounts of chemicals derived from ethylene, propylene, benzene, iso-and, n-butane and n-Octene as well as ethyl and butylchlorides, palm and coconut oil, methanol, phosphorus and urea. In addition, chlorine, caustic, other petrochemicals and metals like tin, aluminum and zinc represent some key materials used in our chemical manufacturing processes. Major requirements for key raw materials are purchased typically pursuant to multi-year contracts. Large increases in the cost of such key raw materials, as well as natural gas, which powers some of our key production facilities, could adversely affect our operating margins if we are not able to pass the higher costs on to our customers through higher sales prices. While temporary shortages of raw materials we use may occur occasionally, key raw materials have generally been available. However, there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments (including markets and political and regulatory conditions) will not affect our raw material supplies, their continuing availability and their cost. For additional information related to these risks, see Item 1A. - Risk Factors.

Seasonal Business
No material portion of our Industrial Performance Products or Industrial Engineered Products business is significantly seasonal. 
Employees
We had approximately 2,500 full time employees at December 31, 2016.
Backlog
We do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. In general, we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of sales or financial performance.
Competitive Conditions
The breadth of our product offering provides multiple channels for growth and mitigates our dependence on any one market or end-use application. We sell our products in more than 70 countries. This worldwide presence reduces our exposure to any one country’s or region’s economy although a majority of our sales are in North America and Europe.
We have a broad customer base and believe that our products, many of which we customize for the specific needs of our customers, allow us to enhance customer loyalty and attract customers that value product innovation and reliable supply.
Product performance, quality, price, and technical and customer service are all important factors in competing in substantially all of our businesses.
We face significant competition in many of the industries in which we operate due to the trends toward global expansion and consolidation by competitors. Many of our existing competitors are larger than we are and may have more resources and better access to capital markets for continued expansion or new product development than we do. Some of our competitors also have a greater product range, are more vertically integrated or have better distribution capability than we do for specific products or geographical areas.
Research and Development
All of our businesses conduct research and development activities to increase competitiveness. Our businesses conduct research and development activities to develop new and optimize existing production technologies, as well as to develop commercially viable new products and applications while also maintaining existing product registrations required by regulatory agencies and customers around the world. Our research and development expense totaled $21 million in 2016, $20 million in 2015 and $36 million in 2014.
Intellectual Property and Licenses
We attach great importance to patents and trademarks in order to protect our investment in research and development, manufacturing and marketing. Our policy is to seek wide protection for significant products and process developments on our major applications. We also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names of our products.
We have approximately 800 United States and foreign granted patents and pending patent applications and approximately 1,000 United States and foreign registered and pending trademarks. Patents, trademarks, trade secrets in the nature of know-how, formulations, and manufacturing techniques assist us in maintaining the competitive position of certain of our products. Our intellectual property is of particular importance to a number of specialty chemicals we manufacture and sell. However, we do business in countries where protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. We are licensed to use certain patents and technology owned by other companies, including some foreign companies, to manufacture products complementary to our own products, for which we pay royalties in amounts not considered material, in the aggregate, to our consolidated results. 
Neither our business as a whole nor any particular segment is materially dependent upon any one particular patent, trademark, copyright or trade secret.
10

Regulatory Matters
Chemical companies are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to land, surface, subsurface strata and water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. Chemical companies are also subject to other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters.
Environmental Health and Safety Regulation - We believe that our business, operations and facilities are being operated in substantial compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations. The ongoing operations of chemical manufacturing plants, however, entail risks in these areas and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred. In addition, future developments of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and related enforcement policies, could bring into question the handling, manufacture, use, emission or disposal of substances or pollutants at facilities we own, use or control. These developments could involve potential significant expenditures in our manufacture, use or disposal of certain products or wastes. To meet changing permitting and regulatory standards, we may be required to make significant site or operational modifications, potentially involving substantial expenditures and reduction or suspension of certain operations. In 2016, we incurred $9 million of costs for capital projects and $56 million for operating and maintenance costs related to environmental, health and safety programs at our facilities. In 2017, we expect to incur approximately $12 million of costs for capital projects and $54 million for operating and maintenance costs related to environmental, health and safety programs at our facilities. During 2016, we paid $8 million to remediate previously utilized waste disposal sites and current and past facilities. We expect to spend approximately $13 million during 2017 to remediate such waste disposal sites and current and former facilities.
