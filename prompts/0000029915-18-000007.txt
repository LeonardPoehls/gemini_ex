RAW MATERIALS
The Company operates in an integrated manufacturing environment. Basic raw materials are processed through many stages to produce a number of products that are sold as finished goods at various points in those processes. The major raw material stream that feeds the production of the Company’s finished goods is hydrocarbon-based raw materials. The Company purchases hydrocarbon raw materials including ethane, propane, butane, naphtha and condensate as feedstocks. These raw materials are used in the production of both saleable products and energy. The Company also purchases certain monomers, primarily ethylene and propylene, to supplement internal production. The Company purchases natural gas, primarily to generate electricity, and purchases electric power to supplement internal generation. The Company also produces a portion of its electricity needs in Louisiana and Texas; Alberta, Canada; and Germany.
Key raw materials purchased for use in the manufacturing process include: acetone, benzene, butane, condensate, electric power, ethane, hexene, methanol, methyl methacrylate, naphtha, natural gas, propane, pygas, silica and styrene. Key raw materials that are produced internally and procured from external sources for internal consumption include aniline, aqueous hydrochloric acid, butyl acrylate, chlorine, ethylene, octene, propylene and silicon metal. Hydrogen peroxide is produced internally and procured through a consolidated variable interest entity and a joint venture. The Company had adequate supplies of raw materials in 2017, and expects to continue to have adequate supplies of raw materials in 2018.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Company is engaged in a continuous program of basic and applied research to develop new products and processes, to improve and refine existing products and processes and to develop new applications for existing products.
