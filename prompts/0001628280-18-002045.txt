ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
At Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc., we seek to redefine the treatment experience for patients suffering from chronic neurological diseases. Our vision is grand, our goal bold: to create and commercialize a new generation of medicines intended to lessen the burden of disease on patients, caregivers and society. With a new commercial medicine and robust pipeline of investigational programs focused on meaningfully differentiated treatment options for patients, we believe we are well on our way. Our therapeutic targets include a broad range of neurologic diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease.
Our treatment innovations stem from a deep scientific understanding of time-dependent biology–the deliberate mapping of disease patterns and drug activity–along with a goal to meaningfully increase the efficacy of known molecules without compromising tolerability. This approach is designed to ensure that our medicines fit within, rather than define, people’s daily lives. Our goal is to develop medicines that are timed for the benefit of patients.
Our understanding of time-dependent biological processes informs our every innovation, targeting advancement in treatment of chronic neurologic disorders. Our expanding portfolio includes:
Approved Product:

• | GOCOVRITM (amantadine) extended release capsules, formerly referred to as ADS-5102, for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications. GOCOVRI was approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on August 24, 2017, with seven years of orphan exclusivity and additional patent protections, and we fully launched GOCOVRI with a deployed sales force in January 2018.

Potential Additional Indications for GOCOVRI (amantadine) Extended Release Capsules (ADS-5102):

• | ADS-5102 in development for the treatment of walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis. We expect the start of our Phase 3 pivotal study in this supplemental indication to occur early in the second quarter of 2018.


• | ADS-5102 in research and potential development for additional indications, including the treatment of wearing OFF and delaying motor complications in Parkinson’s disease, tardive dyskinesia, Huntington’s chorea, Tourette syndrome, and non-motor disorders, including depression, and anti-psychotic induced weight gain. We expect to select additional indications for ADS-5102 by first quarter 2019.

Product Candidates:

• | ADS-4101 (lacosamide) modified release capsules in development for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy. We have requested a meeting with the FDA in the first half of 2018, with the start of a Phase 3 pivotal study planned for 2019, depending on FDA feedback.


• | Additional product candidates in research based on potential new discoveries in Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, as well as new research programs in psychiatry.

Partnered Products:

• | Namzaric® (memantine hydrochloride extended release and donepezil hydrochloride) capsules for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia of an Alzheimer’s type, marketed in the United States by Allergan plc under an exclusive license agreement between us and Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited (“Forest”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc.


• | Namenda XR® (memantine hydrochloride) extended release capsules for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia of an Alzheimer’s type, marketed in the United States by Allergan plc under the Forest license agreement.

Products in our wholly-owned portfolio, potential additional indications for these products, and our product candidates, are protected by an array of intellectual property, including robust and diversified patent claims, and regulatory exclusivities. For example, GOCOVRI is protected by seven-year orphan drug exclusivity, three-year new product exclusivity, and issued patents and pending patent applications out to at least 2035.
We have developed our current portfolio of therapies in a capital efficient manner. As of December 31, 2017, we had raised a total of $201.3 million from equity financings, including $61.8 million in net proceeds raised in January 2016 from the sale of 2,875,000 shares of common stock. We also received $160.0 million in upfront and milestone payments and $4.1 million in development funding from our partnership with Allergan plc. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $211.7 million and $176.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. In May 2017, we entered into a Royalty-Backed Loan, or HCRP Loan, with HealthCare Royalty Partners (“HCRP”). As of December 31, 2017, long-term debt related to our HCRP Loan was $102.6 million. In January 2018, we raised an additional $134.1 million in net proceeds from the sale of 3,450,000 shares of common stock.
Our Market Opportunity
We estimate that approximately 36 million people in the United States suffer from chronic central nervous system, or CNS, disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, psychosis, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease. CNS diseases are frequently treated with multiple medications having different mechanisms of action with the goal of maximizing symptomatic benefits for patients. Existing CNS drugs often require frequent dosing and may have tolerability issues that limit the amount of the drug that can be taken each day. We believe that many CNS disorders could be better addressed in individual patients, as well as society as a whole, if drug concentrations (or the pharmacokinetic profiles) were shaped as a function of time and disease activity, to improve treatment efficacy while maintaining tolerability.
Our Strategy
Our business strategy is to discover, develop, and commercialize clinically differentiated medicines for patients suffering from chronic neurologic disorders, based upon our understanding of time-dependent biology.

Approved Product:
GOCOVRI (formerly referred to as ADS-5102) for the Treatment of Dyskinesia in Patients with Parkinson’s Disease
GOCOVRITM (amantadine) extended-release capsules is the first and only medicine approved by the FDA for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications. GOCOVRI, a high-dose, 274-mg amantadine taken once-daily at bedtime that delivers high levels of amantadine in the morning and throughout the day when dyskinesia occurs, was approved by the FDA on August 24, 2017, and was granted seven years of orphan exclusivity upon its approval. GOCOVRI is now available for patients in need, and we are actively educating physicians about the GOCOVRI proven efficacy and safety profile, and promoting to physicians. We made GOCOVRI available for physician and patient use in the fourth quarter of 2017, and commenced the full commercial launch of GOCOVRI in January 2018. In addition to orphan exclusivity that protects GOCOVRI into 2024, issued patents and filed patent applications potentially provide GOCOVRI additional protections through at least 2035.
Parkinson’s disease is a chronic, neurodegenerative disorder affecting close to one million people in the United States. Levodopa, which replaces lost dopamine, is considered the “gold standard” and the most effective therapy for Parkinson’s disease. Over time, people with Parkinson’s disease require increasingly higher or more frequent doses of levodopa to avoid recurrent periods of OFF time–characterized by slowness of movement, rigidity, impaired walking, tremors, and postural instability–when the underlying symptoms of Parkinson’s disease return. At this stage of the Parkinson’s disease journey, it is characterized by an over-activated glutamate system, which leads to the symptoms of dyskinesia and OFF time. Accordingly, as Parkinson’s disease progresses, approximately 90 percent of people on levodopa therapy will experience dyskinesia, which is characterized by involuntary movements that are non-rhythmic, purposeless and unpredictable, impacting peoples’ daily lives. Of the 400,000 Parkinson’s disease patients in the United States with motor complications, approximately 150,000 to 200,000 suffer with dyskinesia.
In a robust clinical program consisting of three randomized, placebo-controlled studies and a two-year, ongoing, open label safety study, GOCOVRI demonstrated a durable reduction in dyskinesia and secondarily in OFF time in people with Parkinson’s disease. Specifically, the pooled data analysis from the two positive, Phase 3 pivotal trials of GOCOVRI demonstrates: 

• | A 41% reduction in dyskinesia as measured on the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale total score, compared to 14% for placebo at week 12;


• | A reduction in OFF time of approximately one hour per day (placebo adjusted); and


• | An increase of approximately 4.0 hours in functional time daily (or ON time without troublesome dyskinesia).

The most common adverse reactions with GOCOVRI were hallucinations, dizziness, dry mouth, peripheral edema, constipation, falls and orthostatic hypotension. Warnings and precautions with GOCOVRI include falling asleep during activities of daily living, suicidality and depression, orthostatic hypertension/dizziness, and hallucinations/psychotic behavior.
In addition, the ongoing open label safety study of GOCOVRI has demonstrated the long-term durability and safety of GOCOVRI out to 88 weeks, and a significant improvement in patients in the study who were switched from amantadine immediate release treatment to GOCOVRI. We expect the final results of the two-year open label safety study to be reported mid-year in 2018.
As of December 31, 2017, after being available for a little over two months for physician and patient use without sales-based promotional efforts by us, 100 distinct prescribers had prescribed GOCOVRI for Parkinson’s disease patients with dyskinesia. This early reception of GOCOVRI by physicians is consistent with our market research indicating that GOCOVRI would be well-received by physicians, patients and payers. In that research, almost 60% of physicians agree that “efficacy in reducing dyskinesia” was the most important unmet need for dyskinesia treatment. On January 8, 2018, we deployed our field sales team of 59 experienced neurology account specialists specifically to drive awareness and promote GOCOVRI to approximately 6,500 physicians who treat Parkinson’s disease patients. Our sales team will be educating physicians about appropriate use of GOCOVRI using marketing materials developed with 
5

feedback from experts in the Parkinson’s disease community, as well as the published, peer reviewed scientific articles reporting the data from our two pivotal Phase 3 studies of GOCOVRI.
Additionally, while GOCOVRI faces similar launch challenges as any newly approved medicine with a new indication, we are pleased with the payer response to GOCOVRI’s availability since October 2017 at a list price of $28,500 per year. To further facilitate patient access, in October 2017, we launched GOCOVRI Onboard, a patient services program. GOCOVRI Onboard provides reimbursement assistance as well as a Quick Start program that offers eligible patients a supply of GOCOVRI within days of receiving a prescription, while insurance coverage is being adjudicated; a co-pay assistance program for commercially insured patients, to ensure that they pay no more than $20 per prescription; a patient assistance program for under insured or non-insured patients; and the provision of information for government insured patients about available programs to assist with their out of pocket costs.
Potential Additional Indications for GOCOVRI (amantadine) extended release capsules (formerly ADS-5102):
ADS-5102 in Development for the Treatment of Walking Impairment in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis    
ADS-5102, a high-dose amantadine investigational agent taken once-daily at bedtime, was designed to provide a slow initial rate-of-rise in drug concentrations and a delayed time to the maximum concentration. Symptomology of multiple sclerosis walking impairment, or MS Walking, has been associated with dysregulation of the NMDA receptor/glutamate signaling, as has been reported in Parkinson’s disease. Symptoms, therefore, may be improved by modulating over-activated NMDA receptor/glutamate signaling. These symptoms are present during waking hours, not while the individual is asleep. As a result, an effective treatment should provide relief beginning in the morning, and be sustained throughout the day, while not disrupting sleep.
Walking impairment affects a majority of the approximately 400,000 multiple sclerosis patients in the United States. MS Walking remains an area of high unmet need, even though there is one approved product on the market for the indication. Our market research suggests that a high proportion of multiple sclerosis patients develop walking impairment, significantly impacting both quality of life and independence. Additionally, physician satisfaction with current treatment options is low, and payers find current treatment to be inappropriate for newly diagnosed patients and effective only in a minority of patients.
We plan to initiate a Phase 3 study of ADS-5102 for patients with MS Walking early in the second quarter of 2018, based on the feedback we received from our End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. Our Phase 2, 4-week proof-of-concept study showed a significant benefit in walking speed versus placebo on both mean value and the proportion of participants with a clinically significant 17% improvement. The results for timed-up-and-go (TUG) and 2-minute walking test (2MWT) also suggested benefit on other aspects of mobility and walking.
Our Phase 3 program is planned to consist of two Phase 3 studies, a pivotal efficacy and safety study, and an open label safety study. We are also completing non-clinical studies to support the approval in this multiple sclerosis population. If the first pivotal Phase 3 study is successful, we intend to meet with the FDA to confirm the filing requirements for this supplemental NDA.
GOCOVRI (ADS-5102) in Research and Potential Development for Additional Indications    
We are continuing to review the results of preclinical studies, clinical trials, and case reports published in peer reviewed medical journals to evaluate additional potential indications for ADS-5102, including the treatment of wearing OFF and delaying motor complications in Parkinson’s disease, tardive dyskinesia, Huntington’s chorea, Tourette syndrome, and non-motor disorders, including depression, and anti-psychotic induced weight gain. We expect to select additional indications for ADS-5102 by the first quarter of 2019.
Product Candidates:
ADS-4101 in Development for the Treatment of Partial Onset Seizures in Patients with Epilepsy
ADS-4101 is an investigational high-dose, modified release lacosamide capsule, taken once-daily at bedtime. Lacosamide is an anti-epilepsy active ingredient previously approved by the FDA and currently marketed by UCB SA/NV as VIMPAT® (lacosamide). Based upon the patents and regulatory exclusivities listed in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also known as the Orange Book, it is estimated that VIMPAT will lose patent exclusivity in 2022. ADS-4101 was designed to temper the initial rate-of-rise in lacosamide concentrations, 
6

potentially improving the adverse event profile and dose limitations due to dizziness following administration of VIMPAT.
Epilepsy affects an estimated three million Americans, of which approximately 2/3 have partial onset seizures. Of those people with partial onset seizures, about 30% of patients have poor seizure control with current anti-epilepsy drugs. There are limited data on the temporal distribution of seizures over the 24-hour day; however, published studies suggest that seizures occur in a diurnal pattern, characterized by a peak between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. and lowest between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. Thus, by matching the timing pattern of seizures to the concentration of the anti-epileptic drug, with a higher drug concentration during the day and lower drug concentration during the night, ADS-4101 may enable improved seizure control for adults with epilepsy in the United States.
We have completed two Phase 1 studies of ADS-4101 in healthy volunteers. The Phase 1a study showed that a single 400 mg dose of ADS-4101 was better tolerated compared to the equivalent dose of VIMPAT immediate release tablets. The data also demonstrated that ADS-4101 exhibited the desired pharmacokinetic properties, namely a reduced rate of initial rise and delayed time to maximum drug concentration appropriate for bedtime dosing. The recently completed and reported results of a multi-dose Phase 1b study demonstrated that a 600 mg dose of ADS-4101, taken once-nightly, provided a 1.5 to 2.5-fold increase in average lacosamide concentrations throughout the day compared to the maximum approved daily dose of 400 mg, taken as 200 mg twice-daily (BID), of VIMPAT immediate release tablets in healthy volunteers, with comparable tolerability.
We expect to meet with the FDA in a meeting regarding our planned Phase 3, pivotal program for ADS-4101 in the first half of 2018. Our proposed clinical development program includes two Phase 3 studies: a robust pivotal study comparing 400 mg and 600 mg of ADS-4101 to placebo, as well as the active comparator, VIMPAT, and an open-label extension study. Subject to the feedback from the FDA, we anticipate that the Phase 3 study would enroll starting in 2019 and complete enrollment in 2020. The timing of the ADS-4101 clinical development program and its potential approval in the United States is planned to allow us to optimize ADS-4101’s intellectual property protections and market opportunity.
New Product Discovery–Advancing the Product Pipeline
We continue to apply our “time-dependent biology” approach to identify CNS diseases for which we can drive significant improvements in efficacy without compromising tolerability. Research programs underway include: 

• | Additional programs in epilepsy, based upon our seizure profile discoveries;


• | New programs in psychiatry;


• | Additional Parkinson’s products, alone and potentially in combination with ADS-5102; and


• | Additional Multiple sclerosis products, alone and potentially in combination with ADS-5102.

We anticipate conducting four to five discovery projects per year, with the goal to nominate one additional clinical development program per year.
Partnered Products:    
Namzaric® and Namenda XR® for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Dementia of an Alzheimer’s Type
Namzaric (memantine hydrochloride extended release and donepezil hydrochloride) capsules and Namenda XR (memantine hydrochloride) extended release capsules are two commercially available medicines, which are currently marketed by Forest, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc, in the United States for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. Although we are eligible to receive royalties on net sales of Namenda XR beginning in June 2018, we do not expect to receive such royalties because of the potential entry of generic versions of Namenda XR. We are eligible to receive royalties on net sales of Namzaric beginning in May of 2020.

License agreement with Allergan
In November 2012, we granted Allergan an exclusive license, with right to sublicense, certain of our intellectual property rights relating to human therapeutics containing memantine in the United States. In connection with these rights, Allergan markets and sells Namzaric and Namenda XR for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia related to Alzheimer’s disease. Pursuant to the agreement, Allergan made an upfront payment of $65.0 million. We earned and received additional cash payments totaling $95.0 million upon achievement by Allergan of certain development and regulatory milestones. Under the agreement, external costs incurred related to the prosecution and litigation of intellectual property rights are reimbursable.
We are entitled to receive royalties on net sales in the United States by Allergan, its affiliates, or any of its sublicensees of controlled-release versions of memantine products covered by the terms of the license agreement. Beginning in May 2020, we will be entitled to receive royalties in the low to mid-teens from Allergan for sales of Namzaric in the United States. Beginning in June 2018, we will be entitled to receive royalties in the low to mid-single digits for sales of Namenda XR in the United States. Allergan’s obligation to pay royalties with respect to fixed-dose memantine-donepezil products, including Namzaric, continues until the later of (i) 15 years after the commercial launch of the first fixed-dose memantine-donepezil product by Allergan in the United States or (ii) the expiration of the Orange Book listed patents for which Allergan obtained rights from us covering such product. However, Allergan’s obligation to pay royalties for any product covered by the license is eliminated in any quarter where there is significant competition from generics. For further information, see Litigation and Other Legal Proceedings in “Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies” in the accompanying “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report. As stated above, we do not expect to receive royalties on sales of Namenda XR because of the potential entry of generic versions of Namenda XR.
Intellectual property
In developing therapies, we search for large treatment effects in the existing landscape of medicines. From that inquiry, we discover temporal patterns of disease activity and drug response, identify and invent new product candidates designed to achieve potentially greater efficacy with manageable safety and tolerability profiles.
Our success does and will significantly depend upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our product candidates, including usage, pharmacokinetic, composition-of-matter, and formulation patents, as well as patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our novel discoveries and other important technology inventions and know-how. In addition to patents, we 
8

rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
We actively protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees and selected consultants. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. For more information, please see “Risk factors—Risks related to intellectual property.”
As of February 1, 2018, we owned 28 issued U.S. patents, 15 U.S. patent applications, and additional patents and patent applications in other jurisdictions. The patent portfolios for Namenda XR, Namzaric, GOCOVRI, ADS-4101, and ADS-8704 as of February 1, 2018 are summarized below:
GOCOVRI
GOCOVRI for its FDA-approved indication and other indications Adamas is actively studying is currently covered by a total of 13 issued U.S. patents and 7 additional patent applications containing method and composition claims relating to their pharmacokinetic profile and dosing of amantadine. These patents and applications, if issued, expire at least as late as 2035. These patents and patent applications are wholly owned by us and are not subject to any license agreements. We also own additional foreign patent applications covering GOCOVRI.
ADS-4101
ADS-4101 is currently covered by U.S. and PCT patent applications containing method and composition claims relating to their pharmacokinetic profile and dosing of antiepileptic agents. Patents issuing from these applications, if issued, will expire in 2036. These patent applications are wholly owned by us and are not subject to any license agreements.
Namenda XR, Namzaric
Namenda XR and Namzaric are covered by a total of 13 of our issued U.S. patents containing method and compositions claims relating to their pharmacokinetic profile and method claims relating to dosing of memantine. These patents expire as late as 2029 and are exclusively licensed to Allergan. We also own additional foreign patents and patent applications covering Namenda XR and Namzaric.
ADS-8704 (memantine HCl/donepezil HCl, outside of the United States only)
We have retained the rights and continue to evaluate potential development and commercialization pathways for ADS-8704, a fixed-dose combination of our proprietary controlled-release version of memantine and donepezil for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia related to Alzheimer’s disease in various non-U.S. markets.
Research and Development
We continue to maintain our commitment to research and development, and a significant portion of our operating expenses is related to research and development. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for costs and expenses related to research and development, and other financial information for each of the fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, which information is incorporated by reference here.
Commercial activities, including sales and marketing
We made GOCOVRI available for physician and patient use in the fourth quarter of 2017, and commenced the full commercial launch of GOCOVRI in January 2018. In connection with this launch, we deployed a sales force of 59 Neurology Account Specialists plus 6 regional business directors. A significant portion of our operating expenses in 2018 will be related to our commercialization activities. Specifically, we estimate that we will focus our marketing and sales efforts on approximately 6,500 physician targets. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for revenues and our net loss for each of the fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, and total assets as of the end of each of those three years, which information is incorporated by reference here. For 2017, sales of GOCOVRI accounted for over 99% of our revenues, while in 2016 and 2015 all of our revenues were from 
9

reimbursements for research and development expenses under our license agreement with Allergan and from government contracts.
All of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, were generated in the United States. As of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, all long-lived assets were in the United States. See “Risk Factors” for risks attendant to foreign operations.
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions, and others.
Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer, or less costly than any that will be commercialized by us, or obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop, and manage a portfolio of drugs that are safer, more efficacious, and/or more cost-effective than alternative therapies.
GOCOVRITM
The commercialization of new pharmaceutical products is highly competitive, and we face substantial competition with respect to GOCOVRI. For example, although GOCOVRI is the first and only FDA-approved medicine for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications, we may face competition from various drugs approved for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, such as Azilect (Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, Ltd.), Requip XL (GlaxoSmithKline plc), Mirapex ER (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc.), Neupro Patch (UCB SA/NV), Sinemet (Merck & Co., Inc.), Parcopa (Schwartz Pharma, Mylan and others), Rytary (Impax), Duopa (AbbVie), Xadago (Newron Pharmaceuticals S.p.A.), Osmolex ER (Osmotica Pharmaceuticals LLC) and immediate release amantadine. Other products in late stage development for Parkinson’s disease includes product candidates from Acorda, Mitsubishi Tanabe, Bial-Portela CSA, Genervon Biopharmaceuticals, and Pharma Two B. GOCOVRI may also face competition from drugs currently in development for dyskinesia in Parkinson’s disease or for Parkinson’s disease from a number of pharmaceutical companies, such as Novartis, Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Neurolixis, Amarantus BioScience, Addex Pharma, and Neurim Pharmaceuticals Ltd. In addition, GOCOVRI will face competition from the medical strategies historically used by physicians to manage dyskinesia, such as levodopa dose fractionation.
Many of our competitors, including a number of large pharmaceutical companies that compete directly with us, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise commercializing approved products than we do. Also, many of our competitors are large pharmaceutical companies that will have a greater ability to reduce prices for their competing drugs in an effort to gain market share and undermine the value proposition that we might otherwise be able to offer to payers.
Also, GOCOVRI may potentially face competition from other extended release versions of amantadine approved by the FDA that may be in development, even if not approved for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease or approved without new clinical efficacy and safety data. For example, on February 16, 2018, the FDA approved Osmolex ER (amantadine) extended release tablets, manufactured by Osmotica Pharmaceuticals, LLC, for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions.
Namzaric/Namenda XR
In the market for Alzheimer’s disease treatments, Namenda XR and Namzaric compete or will compete with branded and generic products such as galatamine, rivastigmine, and donepezil. In addition, Allergan currently markets Namenda, the immediate-release version of memantine, which physicians and patients may favor instead of Namenda 
10

XR, the controlled-release version. In addition, generic versions of Namenda became available in 2015. Several generic manufacturers have or are currently seeking regulatory approval or have received regulatory approval to market generic versions of Namenda XR and Namzaric. We and our partner Allergan continue enforcement of our patent rights with respect to these products. We are also aware that other biopharmaceutical companies are developing treatments for Alzheimer’s disease that may compete with Namenda XR and Namzaric. See Litigation and Other Legal Proceedings in “Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies” in the accompanying “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report for more information.
Manufacturing
We currently have no manufacturing facilities and limited personnel with manufacturing experience. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce bulk drug substance and finished drug products required for commercialization of GOCOVRI and to supply our clinical trials of ADS 5102 and our other product candidates. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers to manufacture commercial quantities of GOCOVRI, and for other product candidates, if and when we receive approval for marketing by the applicable regulatory authorities. With respect to GOCOVRI and our product candidates, we are seeking to qualify additional manufacturers of both bulk drug substance and finished drug products. For example, with respect to GOCOVRI, the FDA recently approved a supplemental new drug application by which we qualified a second manufacturing site with our current third-party manufacturer of GOCOVRI.
GOCOVRI and our product candidates are based upon controlled release coated pellet technology and can be difficult to manufacture. These products consist of an inert core, a drug layer, an optional seal coating, and controlled release coatings. Our products are made in a fluidized bed coating machine in sequential steps. Once the extended or modified release coating is applied, the coated pellets are tested to ensure that the desired dissolution rate is achieved. These coatings are relatively thin, and susceptible to changes in raw materials, temperature, humidity, and other manufacturing process parameters.
Allergan is responsible for all manufacturing related to Namzaric and Namenda XR.
Our third-party manufacturers, their facilities, and all lots of drug substance and drug products used commercially or in our clinical trials are required to be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements and FDA satisfaction before any product is approved and we can manufacture commercial products. Our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, and civil and criminal penalties. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of our products.
Government regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, tracking, approval, import, export, advertising, and promotion of our products.
The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, including some that must be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices;


• | submission of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;

11


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug candidate for its intended use;


• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with cGMP and Good Clinical Practices; and


• | FDA approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use.

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial by imposing a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial commences at that center. Regulatory authorities or an institutional review board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include a data safety monitoring board, which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
In general, for purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.

• | Phase 1—Studies are initially conducted to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion in healthy volunteers or patients.


• | Phase 2—Studies are conducted with groups of patients with a specified disease or condition to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule, and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.


• | Phase 3—These clinical trials are undertaken in larger patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy, and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may be done globally to support global registrations.

Our product development strategy often relies on using Phase 2/3 studies as a central element of our clinical development plans. Typically, these studies involve the testing of two or more doses of a product candidate, as is characteristic of a Phase 2 study, and also include a sufficient number of patients so that statistically significant evidence of efficacy can be obtained, as is characteristic of a Phase 3 study. In addition, we conduct the studies in a manner that we believe is consistent with the requirements for a Phase 3 study. We believe this approach has the potential to significantly shorten the time frame required for clinical development. The FDA generally requires that sponsors successfully complete two Phase 3 studies to obtain approval for a new drug, though in certain circumstances a single Phase 3 study is sufficient. We design and conduct our Phase 2/3 studies in a manner that is intended to allow the study to qualify as a Phase 3 study for the purposes of approval. The FDA has broad discretion in determining whether or not a completed Phase 2/3 study will be considered the equivalent of a Phase 3 study for the purposes of approval, and there can be no assurance that the FDA will agree with our assessment that the design, conduct, and results of a Phase 2/3 study are such that the study should be treated as a Phase 3 study.
The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information.
12

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
NDA submission, review and approval by the FDA
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) provides two pathways for the approval of new drugs through an NDA. An NDA under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA is a comprehensive application to support approval of a product candidate that includes, among other things, data and information to demonstrate that the proposed drug is safe and effective for its proposed uses, that production methods are adequate to ensure its identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug, and that proposed labeling is appropriate and contains all necessary information. A 505(b)(1) NDA contains results of the full set of preclinical and clinical studies conducted by or on behalf of the applicant to characterize and evaluate the product candidate.
Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA provides an alternate regulatory pathway to obtain FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely to some extent upon the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the reference listed drug (“RLD”), and submit its own product-specific data-which may include data from preclinical or clinical studies conducted by or on behalf of the applicant-to address differences between the product candidate and the RLD. GOCOVRI and our current and anticipated product candidates based upon ADS-5102 are or will be based on already approved active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”), rather than new chemical entities, and a formulation that has been evaluated in Phase 1 studies. Accordingly, we expect to be able to rely on information from previously conducted studies involving our ADS-5102 formulation in our clinical development plans and our NDA submissions. For product candidates that involve novel fixed-dose combinations of existing drugs or for studies of an existing product or product candidate in a new indication, we expect that we will generally be able to initiate Phase 2/3 studies without conducting any new non-clinical or Phase 1 studies. In those instances where our product candidate includes previously unapproved API, we will need to conduct certain non-clinical and Phase 1 studies to investigate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of the product candidate prior to conducting Phase 2/3 studies.
The submission of an NDA under either Section 505(b)(1) or Section 505(b)(2) generally requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. For some NDAs, the FDA may convene an advisory committee to seek insights and recommendations on issues relevant to approval of the application. Although the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, the agency usually follows such recommendations. Although the FDA did not do so upon the approval of GOCOVRI, the FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks, and the product can therefore be approved. A REMS may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, depending on what the FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain applications for approval must include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug or biological product in relevant pediatric populations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. 
Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, within 60 days after submission of the NDA, the FDA’s goal for a non-priority review of an NDA is ten months from submission for Section 505(b)(2) applications, although the review process can be and often is significantly extended by FDA requests for additional 
13

information, studies, or clarification. Upon completion of its review, the FDA will respond to the applicant by approving the application or issuing a Complete Response letter. A Complete Response letter outlines deficiencies in the NDA and may request additional information, including additional preclinical or clinical data. Even if an applicant submits this additional information, the FDA may determine that the NDA still does not meet the standards for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor. The timing of approval, if any, of any NDA we submit will depend on when the FDA determines that the NDA satisfies all requirements for approval. Also, even if the FDA approves an NDA, such approval may entail limitations on the uses or conditions for which such product may be marketed, or the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product, and may further limit the marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. The FDA may withdraw approval of an NDA if the sponsor does not comply with extensive post-marketing regulatory requirements (as described below) or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, established two abbreviated approval pathways for pharmaceutical products that are in some way follow-on versions of already approved products: the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway, described above, and the abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) pathway. To facilitate these abbreviated approval pathways, NDA applicants are required to list the FDA information concerning certain patents with claims that cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA and upon the issuance of any new patent claims that meet the requirements for submission to the FDA, the NDA holder is required to update the information and submit any new information concerning applicable patents, which will then be published in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA (1) that no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) that such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant provides a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the competitor must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the RLD and the patent owner once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. If the NDA holder or patent owner files a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not approve the 505(b)(2) application or ANDA until the earlier of 30 months from the date the NDA or patent holder receives notice of the certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. If a listed patent claims a method of using the approved drug, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may, instead of submitting a certification to the patent, submit a “Section viii” statement certifying that the labeling for the proposed product does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding the patented method-of-use. We and Forest have received notices of ANDAs submitted to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market generic versions of Namenda XR and Namzaric, and we and Forest have agreed to settlements with certain ANDA filers on Namenda XR and Namzaric and we are currently in litigation with one filer in each case. For further information, see Litigation and Legal Proceedings in “Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies” in the accompanying “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides periods of regulatory exclusivity for products that would serve as RLDs for an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. If a product is a new chemical entity, or NCE-generally meaning that the active moiety has never before been approved in any drug-there is a period of five years from the product’s approval during which the FDA may not accept for filing any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a drug with the same active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted after four years, however, if the sponsor makes a Paragraph IV certification challenging a listed patent. Because of relevant statutory and regulatory provisions, as well as the time it takes for the FDA to review and approve an application, five-year NCE exclusivity usually effectively means an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is not approved for a period well beyond five years after approval of the RLD.
A product, like GOCOVRI, that is not an NCE may qualify for a three-year period of exclusivity if the NDA contains clinical data that were necessary for approval. In that instance, the exclusivity period does not preclude filing or review of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application; rather, the FDA may not grant final approval to the ANDA or 505(b)
14

(2) application until three years after approval of the RLD. Additionally, the exclusivity applies only to the conditions of approval that required submission of the clinical data. For example, if an NDA is submitted for a product that seeks approval for a new indication, and clinical data were required to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of the product for that use, the FDA could not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for another product with that active moiety for that use. Upon receiving FDA approval, GOCOVRI received this three-year exclusivity for the submission of new clinical data that was necessary for approval.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also established provisions for patent term restoration, under which some of the term of a patent is extended, in order to compensate for time spent developing the product and for the FDA review and approval process. Generally, if an NDA represents the first time an active ingredient has been approved, the applicant can seek extension of one patent that claims the product. The additional patent term cannot exceed five years, and cannot extend the patent more than 14 years after the date of product approval. We currently do not anticipate applying for patent term extension for our product candidates.
Orphan Drug designation and exclusivity
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug or biologic is intended to treat a rare disease or condition and meets other qualifying criteria, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to the product for that use. The benefits of orphan drug designation include research and development tax credits and exemption from user fees. In general, a drug that is approved for the orphan drug designated indication is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity, and during that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity. 
Post-approval requirements
Any drug products we manufacture, market, or distribute pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. For example, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities, including by the FDA for compliance with cGMP, which imposes significant manufacturing-related requirements. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements imposed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. If we or our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with FDA requirements, for example, the FDA may take enforcement action, including, but not limited to, halting our clinical trials, requiring us to recall a product from distribution, or seeking to withdraw approval of an NDA or other necessary licenses.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. A company’s promotional claims about the safety and efficacy of its drug products must be consistent with FDA-approved labeling, truthful, and non-misleading. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning or untitled letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may legally prescribe approved drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such “off-label” use is common in some areas of medicine and reflects physicians’ professional judgment that such use is an appropriate treatment option for patients under certain circumstances. The FDA does not regulate physicians’ practice of medicine, but the FDA does restrict manufacturers’ communications about their drug products, including communications about unapproved uses of approved products.
In addition to these post-marketing requirements, companies that manufacture or distribute drug products or that hold approved NDAs must comply with numerous other post-marketing regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, and maintaining certain records. 
The extensive laws and regulations that apply to the research, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising, and promotion of drug products and product candidates in the United States are subject to change, and it is difficult to foresee whether, how, and when such changes may affect our business.

Other healthcare regulations
Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, sales, promotion, distribution, medical education, and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services and its various divisions, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and state and local governments. Our business activities must comply with numerous healthcare laws, including but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, the Veterans Health Care Act, and similar state laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. Liability under the Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without a person or entity having actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. We seek to comply with these exceptions and safe harbors whenever possible, but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and our business practices may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor or if there is no exception or safe harbor available. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the statute and to share in any monetary recovery. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated or subject to lawsuits by whistleblowers and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper marketing activities. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claim laws, including federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs.
We and our business activities are subject to the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
Additionally, the federal Open Payments program requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the federal government information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and federal False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. These include state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in the states; restrict when pharmaceutical companies may provide meals to prescribers or engage in other marketing related activities; and/or require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct. Outside the U.S., we may be subject to similar regulations in those countries where we market and sell products.
16

In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (including the imposition of significant penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that negatively affects our business. In addition, healthcare providers who prescribe our products and research institutions we collaborate with are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”). HIPAA and its implementing regulations impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates-independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we will have to comply with the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (“VHCA”). The VHCA requires manufacturers to offer their covered drugs (biologics and single source and innovator multiple source drugs) for sale to certain federal agencies, including but not limited to, the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), on a Federal Supply Schedule contract, at a price no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”). The FCP is based on the non-federal average manufacturer price, or Non-FAMP, which we will have to calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. In addition, the Federal Supply Schedule contract requires compliance with applicable federal procurement laws.
Depending on the circumstances, failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties, including criminal, civil, and/or administrative criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, individual imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits, and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business.
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) was passed, which has substantially changed how health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and has significantly impacted the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The PPACA, among other things, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (“MDRP”) are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the MDRP, extended the MDRP to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and provided for a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale 
17

discounts off negotiated prices of applicable branded drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.
Some of the provisions of the PPACA have yet to be fully implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 23, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices.
There has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, have been designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
We expect that the PPACA, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize. There have also been proposals to impose federal rebates on Medicare Part D drugs, requiring federally-mandated rebates on all drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D enrollees or on only those drugs dispensed to certain groups of lower income beneficiaries. If any of these proposals are adopted, they could result in us owing additional rebates, which could have a negative impact on revenues from sales of any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize.
Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement
Our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our products, will depend in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including, in the U.S., governmental payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. We intend to participate in and then will have certain price reporting and other obligations to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and other governmental pricing programs. These obligations are discussed in greater detail under the heading “If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs that we may join if we successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” in Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Political, economic, and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the U.S. to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize profitably. We expect to experience pricing pressure in the U.S. in connection with the sale of our products due to managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, additional legislative proposals to curb healthcare costs, and negative publicity regarding pricing and price increases generally, which could limit the prices that we charge for any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize, limit our commercial opportunity, and/or negatively impact revenues from sales of our products. We anticipate that the U.S. Congress, state legislatures, and the private sector will 
18

continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs, particularly given the current atmosphere of mounting criticism of prescription costs in the U.S. These cost containment measures include controls on government-funded reimbursement for drugs; new or increased requirements to pay prescription drug rebates to government health care programs; pharmaceutical cost transparency bills that aim to require drug companies to justify their prices; controls on healthcare providers; challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means; requirements to try less expensive products or generics before a more expensive branded product; changes in drug importation laws; expansion of use of managed care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person; and public funding for cost effectiveness research, which may be used by government and private third-party payers to make coverage and payment decisions. For example, much attention has been paid to legislation proposing federal rebates on Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage utilization for drugs issued to certain groups of lower income beneficiaries and the desire to change the provisions that treat these dual-eligible patients differently from traditional Medicare patients. Any such changes could have a negative impact on revenues from sales of any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize.
Coverage, reimbursement, and formulary placement decisions are being negotiated on a plan by plan basis for GOCOVRI for the treatment of dyskinesia in Parkinson’s disease. Coverage, reimbursements, and placement decisions for a new product are based on many factors including the coverage, reimbursement, and placement of already marketed branded drugs for the same or similar indications, the safety and efficacy of the new product, availability of generics for similar indications, and the clinical need for the new product. Within the Medicare program, as self-administered drugs, GOCOVRI would be reimbursed under the expanded prescription drug benefit, known as Medicare Part D. This program is a voluntary Medicare benefit administered by private plans that operate under contracts with the federal government. These Part D plans negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers, which are passed on to each of the plan’s enrollees. Historically, Part D beneficiaries have been exposed to significant out-of-pocket costs after they surpass an annual coverage limit and until they reach a catastrophic coverage threshold. However, changes made by recent legislation will reduce this patient coverage gap, known as the “donut hole”, by transitioning patient responsibility in that coverage range from 100% in 2010 to only 25% in 2019. To help achieve this reduction, since 2011, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to pay quarterly discounts of 50% off the negotiated price of branded drugs issued to Medicare Part D patients in the donut hole, and such quarterly discounts will increase to 75% in 2019.
If a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, as applicable, as well as with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, or the OBRA, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or the VHCA, each as amended. Among other things, the OBRA requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs and empowers states to negotiate rebates on pharmaceutical prices, which may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply.
Third-party payers decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement and co-pay levels. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Even with studies, any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize may be considered less safe, less effective, or less cost-effective than other products, and third-party payers may not provide coverage and reimbursement for any of our product candidates that we commercialize, in whole or in part. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. For example, third-party payers have started to require discounts and/or exclusivity arrangements with some drug manufacturers in exchange for including a specific product on their formularies. Any such requirements could have a negative impact on revenues from sales of our products.
Payers also are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price, and actual acquisition cost. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting 
19

Medicaid reimbursement rates. Both Medicare and Medicaid are administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). CMS surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. It is difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payers to cover our products.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Foreign regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. Under an agreement with Forest, we hold the rights to manufacture and market an extended-release memantine and a fixed-dose combination of memantine and donepezil in ex-U.S. markets. However, we have not yet taken any steps to market these products. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Under the European Union regulatory system, we may submit applications for marketing authorizations either under a centralized, decentralized, or mutual recognition marketing authorization procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization for a medicinal product by the European Commission on the basis of a positive opinion by the EMA. A centralized marketing authorization is valid for all European Union member states and three of the four EFTA States (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure apply between European Union member states. The decentralized marketing authorization procedure involves the submission of an application for marketing authorization to the competent authority of all European Union member states in which the product is to be marketed. One national competent authority, selected by the applicant, assesses the application for marketing authorization. The competent authorities of the other European Union member states are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territory on the basis of this assessment, except where grounds of potential serious risk to public health require this authorization to be refused. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of marketing authorizations delivered by the national competent authorities of European Union member states by the competent authorities of other European Union member states. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of a European Union member state requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another European Union member state for the same medicinal product.
Medicinal products that are (a) used to treat or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect no more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union; or (b) used to treat or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions and that, for economic reasons, would be unlikely to be developed without incentives; and (c) where no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned exists, or, if such a method exists, the medicinal product would be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, may be granted an orphan designation in the European Union. The application for orphan designation must be submitted to the EMA and approved before an application is made for marketing authorization for the product. Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity. During this ten-year period, with a limited number of exceptions, neither the competent authorities of the European Union member states, the EMA, or the European Commission are permitted to accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products with the same therapeutic indication. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient 
20

quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this latter product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
We are subject to the U.K. Bribery Act and other third country anti-corruption laws and regulations pertaining to our financial relationships with foreign government officials. The U.K. Bribery Act, which applies to any company incorporated or doing business in the UK, prohibits giving, offering, or promising bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official or private person, and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent bribery amongst employees and other agents. Penalties under the Bribery Act include potentially unlimited fines for companies and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances. Liability in relation to breaches of the Bribery Act is strict. This means that it is not necessary to demonstrate elements of a corrupt state of mind. However, a defense of having in place adequate procedures designed to prevent bribery is available.
