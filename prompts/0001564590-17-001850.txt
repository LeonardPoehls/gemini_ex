Item 1. BUSINESS 
Merger Agreement
 
On January 7, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (“UnitedHealth Group”), and UnitedHealth Group’s wholly owned subsidiaries, Spartan Merger Sub 1, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Purchaser”), and Spartan Merger Sub 2, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Merger Sub 2”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, UnitedHealth Group has agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock for $57.00 per share, to be funded with a combination of cash and UnitedHealth Group common stock, as set forth in the Merger Agreement. Purchaser intends to commence an exchange offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement. Consummation of the exchange offer is subject to customary closing conditions, as set forth in the Merger Agreement. As soon as practicable following the consummation of the exchange offer, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Purchaser will merge with and into the Company pursuant to the provisions of section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “First Merger”), with no stockholder vote required to consummate the First Merger, and the Company surviving as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Merger Sub 2. Immediately following the First Merger, the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub 2 (the “Second Merger” and together with the First Merger, the “Mergers”), with Merger Sub 2 surviving the Second Merger as a wholly owned direct subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group.
 
The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of the parties customary for transactions of this type. Until the earlier of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Mergers, the Company has agreed to operate its business and the business of its subsidiaries in the ordinary course and has agreed to certain other operating covenants, as set forth more fully in the Merger Agreement. The Company has agreed not to solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the making of any alternative acquisition proposals. However, the Company may, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, furnish information to, and engage in discussions and negotiations with, a third party that makes an unsolicited acquisition proposal that our Board of Directors reasonably believes is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal. Under certain circumstances and upon compliance with certain notice and other specified conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Company may terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal. 
 
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both UnitedHealth Group and the Company and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances relating to competing acquisition proposals, including if the Company terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal, or where our Board of Directors changes its recommendation in favor of the transaction, the Company may be required to pay UnitedHealth Group a termination fee of $90.0 million.
 
Additional information about the merger is set forth in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
 Overview
  We are a leading national provider of solutions to physicians, health plans and health systems to optimize surgical care. We operate one of the largest networks of surgical facilities in the United States, which as of December 31, 2016 included 197 ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”) and seven surgical hospitals in partnership with approximately 3,000 physician partners. Our business model is focused on building strategic relationships with health plans, medical groups and health systems to invest in, develop and optimize facilities in an aligned economic model that enables better access to high-quality care at lower cost. We believe that our partnership strategy and comprehensive suite of solutions will enable continued growth by capitalizing on increasing demand for high quality, cost-effective settings of care, the increasing need for scaled partners in healthcare, the transition to a coordinated care delivery model and the trend of physician and health system consolidation. 
 The healthcare industry is in the midst of a transition characterized by increasing focus on cost containment and clinical outcomes, driven by recent regulatory efforts and new payment and delivery models. In this environment, improving clinical quality and reducing the cost of surgical delivery, which represents one of the largest components of medical spending in the United States, continue to be of greater focus. We believe that we are a critical part of the solution because we provide a lower-cost delivery alternative that: (1) enhances the quality of care and patient experience; (2) provides a strategic approach for physicians that improves productivity and economic alignment; (3) offers an efficient and lower-cost alternative for health plans, risk-bearing medical groups and employers; (4) enables our health system partners to expand access within their markets while addressing the pressures resulting from changing payment models; and (5) helps physicians to remain independent.
Our scale of operations allows us to provide our health plan, medical group and health system partners with a comprehensive suite of services that support clinical quality, operational efficiency and enhanced financial performance. We offer tools and systems in the 
 3

areas of clinical benchmarking, clinical best practices, operating efficiency, care coordination and supply chain management. Our partnership model aligns the interests of our partners in achieving strong clinical and operational outcomes. 
 Following the purchase of our company in 2007 by TPG Global, LLC (together with its affiliates, “TPG”), MTS-SCA Acquisition LLC (“MTS”) and certain of our current and former directors, our senior leadership team focused on building our team and capabilities to position the company as a leading partner to health plans, medical groups and health systems to transform the delivery of outpatient surgical care in markets across the country. We have experienced significant growth in our partnerships, resulting in strong performance in our key operational and financial metrics, including: (1) our patient Net Promoter Score, which is a measure of loyalty based on asking patients whether they would recommend our facilities to a friend or family member, (2) our physician Net Promoter Score, which is a measure of loyalty based on asking physicians whether they would recommend performing cases at our facilities to a physician colleague, and (3) the number of physicians performing procedures in our affiliated facilities, which was over 7,700 in 2016.
 Our strategy has also fueled strong financial performance. Because our business model is based on creating partnerships with strategic entities in the markets we serve, our operations are accounted for through a combination of consolidation and equity method accounting.  Therefore, we also review several internal supplemental operating measures that do not comply with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), such as systemwide net operating revenues growth, which includes both consolidated and nonconsolidated facilities (without adjustment based on our percentage of ownership), Adjusted EBITDA-NCI and Adjusted net income. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered substitutes for and are not comparable to our GAAP financial measures (see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Adjusted EBITDA-NCI and Adjusted net income Reconciliations” for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA-NCI and Adjusted net income and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA-NCI and Adjusted net income to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Consolidated Subsidiaries and Nonconsolidated Affiliates” for an explanation of systemwide metrics). Some of these GAAP and non-GAAP measures are listed below.
  
• | Consolidated total net operating revenues increased from $864.7 million in 2014 to $1,281.4 million in 2016, representing a 21.7% compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Systemwide total net operating revenues increased at a 17.6% CAGR from 2014 to 2016;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Net income attributable to SCA increased from $32.0 million in 2014 to $35.4 million in 2016, representing a 5.2% CAGR;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Net income increased from $157.1 million in 2014 to $226.3 million in 2016, representing a 20.0% CAGR; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adjusted EBITDA-NCI increased from $156.7 million in 2014 to $201.1 million in 2016, representing a 13.3% CAGR.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The revenues and expenses of affiliated facilities in which we do not have a controlling interest but do have an equity interest are not directly included in our consolidated GAAP results; rather, only the net income earned from such facilities is reported on a net basis in the line item Equity in net income of nonconsolidated affiliates, and we refer to such facilities as our “nonconsolidated facilities.” 
 We present Adjusted EBITDA-NCI because we believe it is useful for investors to analyze our operating performance on the same basis as that used by our management. Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA-NCI can be useful to facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods because it excludes the effect of depreciation and amortization, which represents a non-cash charge to earnings, income tax, interest expense and other expenses or income not related to the normal, recurring operations of our business. 
 Our Affiliated Facilities 
 Our network of facilities includes ASCs and surgical hospitals. Like hospitals, ASCs serve as locations where physicians on each individual facility’s medical staff perform surgery. Our ASCs provide the facilities, equipment, supplies and clinical support staff necessary to provide non-emergency surgical services to patients not requiring hospitalization. Advances in pain management and non-invasive surgical techniques have broadened the surgical procedures performed in ASCs to include such procedures as total joint replacements. Surgeries in ASCs are typically reimbursed at significantly lower rates than in a hospital setting, and ASCs generally operate with greater efficiency and lower costs. For the year-ended December 31, 2016, our ASCs generated 87% of our net operating revenues. Our surgical hospitals allow physicians to perform a broader range of surgical procedures, including more complex surgeries, and allow patients to stay in the hospital for several nights to recover if needed. For the year-ended December 31, 2016, our surgical hospitals generated 13% of our net operating revenues. 
 Physicians at our facilities provide surgical services in a wide variety of specialties, including orthopedics, ophthalmology, gastroenterology, pain management, otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat, or “ENT”), urology, neurosurgery and gynecology, as well 
 4

as other general surgery procedures. As of December 31, 2016, we consolidated the operations of 125 of our 205 affiliated facilities, had 61 nonconsolidated affiliated facilities and held no ownership in 19 affiliated facilities that contract with us to provide management services. 
 Our Strategic Partnerships
 
We work to build strategic relationships with health plans, medical groups and health systems. We partner with physicians and physician groups who are equity investors in our affiliates and value our expertise in managing ASCs and surgical hospitals and engaging other health care participants to drive value. We seek to build strategic partnerships with health plans to provide high-quality low cost surgical care to their members. These strategic partnerships increasingly include value-based payment models of varying forms, all designed to incentivize surgeons to select the optimal modality of care for their patients. 
 
In certain markets we have chosen to partner with health systems that are seeking to affiliate with a growing number of surgeons through ASC joint ventures. We believe we are a partner of choice to leading health systems because of our comprehensive suite of surgical solutions, expertise in clinical operations and efficiency programs and development expertise.
 Our Industry 
 Medical costs account for a substantial percentage of the United States economy. The United States spent $3.2 trillion on healthcare in 2015, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), and the percentage of gross domestic product devoted to healthcare increased from 6.9% in 1970 to 17.8% in 2015. Surgical delivery is one of the largest components of medical costs in the United States, representing approximately 30% of medical spending for individuals with commercial insurance and Medicare, according to our estimates.
Against this backdrop, we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from trends currently affecting the markets in which we compete, including: 
 Continued Migration of Procedures Out of Hospitals 
 According to the American Hospital Association, outpatient surgeries increased from 57.2% of total surgery volumes to 65.9% from 1994 to 2014. In addition, a significant share of outpatient surgeries shifted from hospitals to free-standing facilities over a similar period. Advancements in medical technology, such as lasers, arthroscopy, fiber optics and enhanced endoscopic techniques, have reduced the trauma of surgery and the amount of recovery time required by patients following certain surgical procedures. Improvements in anesthesia have also shortened the recovery time for many patients by minimizing post-operative side effects such as nausea and drowsiness, thereby avoiding, in some cases, overnight hospitalization. These medical advancements have significantly increased the number of procedures that can be performed in a surgery center and have fueled the migration of surgical procedures out of hospitals and into outpatient settings. We expect that continued advancements in technology and technique will advance this trend.
Growing Focus on Containment of Healthcare Costs 
 Because of an increased focus on controlling the growth of healthcare expenditures in the United States, constituents across the healthcare continuum, including government payors, private insurance companies and self-insured employers, are implementing meaningful cost containment measures. These initiatives have contributed to the shift in the delivery of healthcare services away from traditional inpatient hospitals to more cost-effective settings, such as ASCs. For example, based on Medicare fee schedules, a procedure in an ASC costs, on average, 53% of what the same procedure costs when performed in a hospital surgery department, according to the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association. The cost differential creates savings for the government, Medicare plans, commercial payors and patients when a procedure is performed at an ASC instead of a hospital-based surgery department.
 In addition, as self-insured employers look to reduce their overall healthcare costs, they are shifting increased financial responsibility to patients through higher co-pays and deductibles. These changes to health plan design, coupled with increased pricing transparency, have encouraged patients to seek out more cost-effective options for their healthcare delivery and may reduce demand for discretionary healthcare services. Because of their cost advantage and high patient satisfaction, we believe that ASCs stand to benefit from this increase in consumerism.
 Opportunities Created by Healthcare Legislation 
 We anticipate that healthcare legislation will create greater opportunities for cost-effective providers of healthcare. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“Affordable Care Act”) and other related healthcare reform activities are expected to promote the transition from traditional fee-for-service payment models to more “at risk” or “capitated” models in which providers receive a flat fee per member per month from payors, regardless of the cost of care. This shift will create financial incentives for “at-risk” providers to 
 5

direct patient procedures into the most cost-effective settings, such as ASCs and surgical hospitals. Some health systems are actively working to shift categories of surgical cases out of their hospital surgery departments into the lower-cost ASC setting, in some cases in the context of shared savings and Accountable Care Organizations (“ACOs”). Given that, according to management estimates, surgical spending currently represents approximately 30% of all medical spending for individuals with commercial insurance and Medicare, the shift to “at risk” payment models is likely to create greater interest from physicians and health systems in shifting care to ASCs.
Dynamics Impacting Health Systems 
 Many hospitals and health systems anticipate strategic and financial challenges stemming from healthcare reform and growing efforts to contain healthcare costs. In response, many health systems are focused on strategies to reduce operating costs, build market share, align with physicians, create additional service lines, expand their geographic footprint and prepare for new payment models, including ACOs. ACOs are networks of doctors, hospitals and other healthcare providers who share responsibility for providing coordinated care to patients with the goal of improving quality and reducing overall spending. As a result, a growing number of health systems are entering into strategic partnerships with select provider organizations that can provide focused expertise, scaled operating systems, best practices, speed of execution and financial capital. 
Increased Pressure on Physicians and Physician Groups 
 Physicians in many markets are increasingly interested in aggregating and entering into affiliations with an operating partner that can help ensure the continued growth and efficiency of their practices. Uncertainty regarding reimbursement, along with increased financial and administrative burdens resulting from healthcare legislation, has contributed to this trend. As a result, physicians in many markets are pursuing partnerships with large surgical groups, multi-specialty groups and health systems in order to gain greater stability, access to scaled clinical and operating systems and a pathway to participating in new payment models. This is creating opportunities for providers with expertise in and a track record of structuring partnerships with physicians and other health care participants. 
Continued Provider Consolidation Driven by Changing Environment 
 We believe that consolidation among healthcare providers and health plans will continue due to cost pressures, a changing regulatory environment and the requirements imposed by new payment and delivery models. Our industry remains highly fragmented relative to other healthcare sectors, with the three largest companies in our industry operating an aggregate of only 13% of approximately 5,500 Medicare-certified ASCs in the United States as of December 31, 2016. We expect consolidation to continue, as larger operators like us bring to bear the benefits of systems, processes and larger-scale relationships. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe that we are well-positioned to continue growing, due to: (1) our commitment to outstanding patient care; (2) our experience and capability in partnering with health plans, medical groups and health systems; and (3) the sophistication and capability of our team and our operating systems. We believe the increasing focus of the U.S. healthcare market on enhancing quality of care, the patient experience and the cost-effectiveness of healthcare aligns with our competitive strengths: 
Diversified Growth Strategy
 Our business model is focused on building strategic relationships with leading health plans, medical groups and health systems to invest in, develop and operate facilities, including de novo facilities, which are newly developed ASCs, in an aligned economic model. The alignment of strategic and financial interests through shared ownership is an integral component of our ability to achieve strong results—clinically, operationally and financially. We believe that our business model positions us for continued growth:
Strong same-site growth. We believe that several factors will contribute to continued same-site growth: (1) our strong physician satisfaction, (2) the continued focus of our regional facility leadership on physician recruitment, leveraging our tools and systems, (3) the fact that a significant majority of our facilities are multi-specialty (179 of our 205 affiliated facilities), (4) a payor mix weighted toward non-governmental payors (66% of our consolidated net patient revenues and 73% of net patient revenues at our nonconsolidated facilities for the year-ended December 31, 2016 came from commercial payors), and (5) our focus on high acuity, complex procedures and new service line procedures.
 
Growth of health plan partnerships. We are developing strategic partnerships with an increased number of health plans, and we believe these types of partnerships can generate same-site and acquisition-driven growth.  For example, certain of our facilities are financially accountable to a health plan for the quality of care provided at the facility by its affiliated surgeons, and they partner with 
 6

health plans to develop and operate programs that provide physicians with incentives to choose our lower cost ASCs and surgical hospitals when clinically appropriate.
 
Growth of medical group partnerships. We have developed strategic partnerships with large medical groups, and we believe these types of partnerships can drive continued same-site and acquisition-driven growth.  These partnerships typically involve the medical group investing in our ASC or surgical hospital joint venture and having a seat on the governing board of the facility to help guide clinical programs at the facility.
 
Growth of health system partnerships. We have partnered with many leading health systems in the country, and these partnerships can create an opportunity for continued growth through expanding our footprint of facilities in the markets of our health system partners. These partnerships typically involve the health system investing in ASCs with us and surgeons, with the health system often providing certain management services to the facility (such as managed care contracting) alongside SCA. 
 
Strategic investments. Our partnership model focused on local market alignment enables us to be a strategic investor in multiple geographic markets within the fragmented ASC industry. From January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2016, we invested in or entered into management agreements with 64 facilities in our existing markets and 73 facilities in new markets. Also during this same time period, we placed into operation three de novo facilities in existing markets and one de novo facility in a new market.
Leading National Brand and Scaled Franchise 
 We believe that a healthcare environment characterized by cost pressure, regulatory change, increased consumerism and consolidation favors large scale operators with strong reputations. We are one of the largest operators of surgical facilities in the United States with 197 ASCs and seven surgical hospitals operating in 33 states. Our national scale and the reputation we have developed helps us to establish strategic partnerships with health plans, medical groups and health systems. Our scale also allows us to invest in capabilities that we can leverage across a large network of opportunities and facilities, including comparative performance analytics, cost of care analytics, senior managed care resources, new service line development resources and supply chain resources. Our facilities have also developed a strong reputation among patients in our communities as a result of our focus on patient care and clinical quality. We provide each patient with a survey regarding their experience at our facilities either by an electronic survey or through traditional mail. According to our patient surveys conducted during 2016, our Net Promoter Score average was approximately positive 91. The Net Promoter Score is a nationally recognized measure of loyalty ranging from negative 100 to positive 100 based on asking patients whether they would recommend our facilities to a friend or family member. The overall response rate for these surveys was approximately 22% in 2016, which represented an average of approximately 13,500 responses received per month.
 Proprietary and Expanding Suite of Technology-Enabled Capabilities 
 We have developed proprietary capabilities that enable health plans, medical groups and health systems to optimize the patient experience, clinical outcomes and cost efficiency (which the Institute for Healthcare Improvement refers to as the “Triple Aim” of healthcare). Our proprietary technology tool set includes: 
  
• | SCA Quality Index. We measure patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes and licensure and accreditation inspection readiness for each affiliated facility and combine those measures into our SCA Quality Index to drive continuous improvement clinically and to increasingly support the transition to new payment models.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SCA Insight TM. Our SCA InsightTM operating system provides detailed benchmarking of key operational measures (including on-time starts, turn-times and operating room utilization). Additionally it provides daily key performance indicator dashboards for volume growth, labor and supply expense metrics and revenue cycle performance. These tools allow management to identify, monitor and adjust areas such as case mix, staffing and operating costs to improve overall performance. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cost of care analytics. Our managed care analytics team performs total cost of care analytics on behalf of health plans and risk-bearing medical groups that help us design strategic partnerships and establish performance goals for those partnerships.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supply chain management system. Our supply chain management system provides detailed analysis on supply cost management to improve purchasing efficiency and costs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our data-driven insight and ability to measure key performance indicators have been integral to achieving clinical and operational excellence and position us for success in the payment models of the future, such as ACOs, bundled payments and capitated models. 
 Strategic Partner to Physicians 
 The evolving healthcare landscape, including regulatory changes, increasing administrative burden, health plan consolidation, shifting competitive landscape and transition to new payment models is increasing pressure on physicians. We offer physicians an attractive solution to help them operate successfully in this environment as we design our facilities, structure our strategic 
 7

relationships and adopt staffing, scheduling and clinical systems and protocols with the aim of increasing physicians’ productivity and promoting their professional and financial success. Our approximately 3,000 physician partners (as of December 31, 2016), many of whom are leading practitioners in their respective fields and geographies, value the efficiency and convenience that our facilities provide. 
 Our success in forming productive relationships with physicians is reflected in both the growth in the number of our physician partners and our Net Promoter Score of positive 89, which was derived from surveys completed by our physician partners and non-partner physician utilizers across 150 of our facilities during January 2017. The survey had an overall response rate of 78% from over 4,000 physicians surveyed.  The Net Promoter Score is a measure of loyalty ranging from negative 100 to positive 100 based on asking each of the physicians who utilize our facilities whether he or she would recommend performing cases at our facilities to a physician colleague.   We monitor physician satisfaction on a facility-by-facility basis and survey all of our physicians who actively utilize our facilities at least annually.  We utilize physician feedback to drive continuous improvement on a local and national basis to strengthen our position as the surgical partner of choice for physicians. 
 Proven Management Team 
 Our senior leadership team averages more than 15 years of experience in the healthcare industry and has transformed our strategic approach to partnering with health plans, medical groups and health systems to optimize surgical care. During the tenure of this management team, we have enhanced our focus on clinical outcomes and patient experience, and we have achieved significant growth in terms of the number of strategic partnerships and financial performance. 
Our Business Strategy 
 We seek to improve the delivery of surgical care and to become the partner of choice for health plans, medical groups and health systems by:
 
• | Delivering outstanding patient care and clinical outcomes;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Driving strong and consistent same-site performance;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Growing existing strategic partnerships with health plans, medical groups and health systems;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing new strategic partnerships with health plans, medical groups and health systems;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expanding into new service lines;
--+----------------------------------


• | Establishing partnerships focused on value-based reimbursement; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consolidating a fragmented industry in attractive markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

Delivering Outstanding Patient Care and Clinical Outcomes 
 We are committed to outstanding patient care and clinical quality. Our culture and operating systems reinforce this focus and commitment. We measure patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes and licensure and accreditation inspection readiness for each affiliated facility and combine those measures into our SCA Quality Index, which we monitor closely to identify areas for improvement and to track progress. We also develop and implement clinical toolkits, clinical training and best practice sharing across our network to drive ongoing improvement in clinical outcomes. Our Regional Quality Councils (“RQCs”) model allows us to develop tools and resources, provide education and communicate clinical best practices.  All of our affiliated facilities have a designated clinical leader to monitor patient outcomes and lead performance improvement initiatives. Our facilities’ clinical leaders are encouraged to participate in regional quality meetings of the RQCs. We have also developed focused training resources that are available to physicians, nurses and surgical technicians at our affiliated facilities, including through a proprietary learning computer portal called the Clinical Excellence Universe (or “CEU”). Our training programs include new teammate trainings, telephone and web conferences focusing on key clinical issues, continuing education programs, leadership development programs and initiatives aimed at enhancing our culture of patient safety. 
Driving Strong and Consistent Same-Site Performance 
 Achieving strong performance on a same-site basis is important for us to drive organic revenue growth as well as support consistent operating performance for us and our partners. We believe that our strategic partnerships align incentives so that we and our partners can achieve improved long-term performance. We also believe that our ability to affiliate with physicians as an extension of their practices is an important driver to sustained same-site performance. Our clinical protocols and tools are designed to improve physician productivity and increase the number of procedures performed in our facilities while improving both physician and patient satisfaction. In addition, our ability to attract physicians through recruitment initiatives provides an additional opportunity for us to drive same-site growth. This alignment with physicians has contributed to annual same site consolidated net operating revenues 
 8

growth of 3.0% in 2016, 8.5% in 2015 and 4.7% in 2014 and annual same site systemwide net operating revenues growth of 6.7% in 2016, 8.1% in 2015 and 3.1% in 2014. We have shown an ability to improve facility-level profitability by gaining physician alignment around more efficient supply utilization, reducing clinical variation, more effectively contracting with payors and lowering administrative costs.
Growing Existing Strategic Partnerships with Health Plans, Medical Groups and Health Systems 
 We intend to continue growing the number of facilities in our existing partnerships with health plans, medical groups and health systems. Our aligned model incentivizes our partners to work closely with us to identify strategically important and financially accretive growth opportunities in the markets we serve. Our experience has shown that demonstrated results in achieving exceptional patient care and strong physician partnerships have encouraged our partners to expand their relationships with us.  
Developing New Strategic Partnerships with Health Plans, Medical Groups and Health Systems 
 We are focused on developing new strategic partnerships with health plans, medical groups and health systems. We believe that our capabilities and our experience with existing strategic partnerships position us strongly to secure additional strategic partnerships. The growing focus on improving the quality of care while reducing the total cost of care makes our partnership model more relevant to health plans, medical groups and health systems, given that surgery represents close to 30% of total medical spending according to management estimates. There is a significant opportunity to enhance care while materially reducing cost by leveraging high-quality, high-efficiency ASCs and surgical hospitals. 
Leveraging Our Core Competencies to Expand into New Service Lines 
 We intend to leverage significant expertise related to the provision of surgical solutions in the form of expansion into new lines of service. For example, we have significantly grown our total joint replacement and complex spine procedure service lines over the past several years. Improvements in surgical technology and technique, along with improvements in the delivery of anesthesia, have allowed more of these complex cases to migrate to the surgery center environment, and we have invested to grow the number of programs, the number of physicians and the number of cases we perform.
 Similarly, we are investing to enhance our capabilities to provide routine cardiovascular and peripheral vascular procedures in the surgery center environment. Similar to total joint replacements and complex spine procedures, we believe that there is a significant opportunity to enhance care and materially reduce the total cost of routine cardiovascular and peripheral vascular care by leveraging high-quality, high-efficiency ASCs and surgical hospitals.
 Establishing Partnerships that Take Advantage of Value-Based Reimbursement 
 We expect the increasing focus on value-based reimbursement to enable additional strategic partnerships with health plans, medical groups and health systems.  Value-based reimbursement refers to new payment models that tie the provider’s payment for services to the predetermined quality outcomes.
 For example, one of our strategic medical group partners is a large, integrated multi-specialty physician group that manages capitated risk for both senior lives (Medicare) and commercial lives. This partner was one of the original five ACOs piloted under a Dartmouth College/Brookings Institute-supported initiative in ACO healthcare delivery. As of December 31, 2016, we had seven joint venture surgical facilities with this physician group, and we have been able to meaningfully improve the cost of surgical care for their population through our strategic partnership.
 As another example, we entered into a commercial bundled payment program for total joint replacements with a major health plan for one of our facilities. The health plan chose to partner with SCA on this bundled payment program because we demonstrated an ability to have strong patient outcomes and patient satisfaction while materially reducing total episode cost through actively managing the patients throughout the process and aligning the interests of the various providers pre- and post-surgery.
Consolidating a Fragmented Industry in Attractive Markets
 We expect to continue our acquisition activity as we partner with more health plans, medical groups and health systems and as we expand our existing strategic partnerships. We believe that our scale, operational expertise and value-added services and solutions differentiate us and provide us with the ability to selectively invest in attractive assets in attractive markets where we can create value, both in the near term as well as over the longer term. We plan to continue to leverage our proven strategy for target identification, thorough diligence, transaction execution and integration, which we have systematically implemented in the investment in 58 consolidated and 55 nonconsolidated facilities from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2016.

Operations 
 General 
 Our operations consist primarily of our ownership and management of ASCs and surgical hospitals. Our affiliated facilities provide the space, equipment and medical support staff necessary for physicians to perform non-emergency surgical procedures. Our typical ASC is a freestanding facility with fully-equipped operating and procedure rooms and ancillary areas for reception, preparation, recovery and administration. Our surgical hospitals provide medical services similar to those provided by our ASCs and can also accommodate more complex procedures, some of which require patients to stay overnight. The typical staff of an affiliated facility includes an administrator/CEO, registered nurses and operating room technicians, as well as personnel in a business office performing tasks such as billing and collecting. In addition, at each facility, a physician who serves as the medical director is responsible for medical direction and certain administrative services at the facility, including ensuring that clinical activities are performed in accordance with the facility’s policies and procedures and serving as a liaison between the facility’s administration and its medical staff. Our facilities generally have service agreements with anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists (“CRNAs”) to provide anesthesiology services. Generally, those anesthesiologists and CRNAs are independent contractors of the facilities and are responsible for their own clinical and billing activities; in a few cases, those individuals are employed by the facility. Otherwise, the physicians who utilize our facilities are not employees of SCA or our facilities. We typically assist each of our facilities by ensuring they are strategically aligned in their markets with the right physician partnerships and appropriate health plan contracts. 
 Each affiliated facility is licensed in accordance with local and state requirements. All of our facilities are also certified as Medicare providers. Our facilities are available for use only by licensed physicians and other qualified healthcare providers. To ensure consistent quality of care, each facility has a medical executive committee comprised of local physicians that reviews the qualifications of each physician who applies to practice at the facility. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, the vast majority of our facilities were accredited by either The Joint Commission or the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (“AAAHC”), the two major national organizations that establish standards relating to the physical plant, administration, quality of patient care and operation of medical staffs of various types of healthcare facilities. We believe that accreditation is the quality benchmark used by commercial health plans for inclusion of a facility in their network. Some health plans may not include a facility in their network unless the facility is accredited.  
 Billing and Payment 
 Our affiliated facilities derive their net patient revenues by collecting institutional fees from patients, insurance companies, government programs and other third-party payors in exchange for the provision of surgical procedures. The surgeons and, in most cases, anesthesiologists and CRNAs at our affiliated facilities bill their patients and other payors directly for their professional services; therefore, such services are not billed by our facilities. 
 Each affiliated facility uses a patient accounting system to manage scheduling, billing and collection, accounts receivable management and other essential operational functions. We have implemented systems to centralize financial data from most affiliated facilities into our corporate data systems. These systems support our access to information on a timely basis. 
 Revenues at our affiliated facilities consist primarily of net patient service revenues that are recorded based upon established billing rates less allowances for contractual adjustments and bad debts. Revenues are recorded during the period in which the healthcare services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from patients and third-party payors, including commercial health plans, employers, workers’ compensation plans and federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs). We utilize the payment history specific to each affiliated facility by health plan to record estimated contractual allowances and allowances for bad debts, and we employ other analytical tools to ensure the appropriateness of these estimates. Third-party payor contractual payment terms are generally based upon predetermined rates per procedure or discounted fee-for-service rates. 
 It is our general practice, where possible, to verify a patient’s insurance and collect estimated co-payments prior to rendering services. Claims are submitted electronically if the health plan accepts electronic claims. We require claims submitted to third-party health plans to be paid within timeframes that are generally consistent with industry standard practices, which vary based upon health plan type. 
 In general, we or our health system partners negotiate contracts directly with non-governmental payors and employers. The rates paid by governmental agencies are set by such agencies and are not subject to negotiation. We market our affiliated facilities directly to non-governmental payors and employers in order to communicate the cost advantages of surgery centers versus hospitals. Health plan marketing and engagement activities are conducted by a specialized team with input from our physician partners. We emphasize the high-quality healthcare, cost advantages and convenience of our affiliated facilities. 
 Patients are generally not responsible for the difference between our established charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid and negotiated health plan contracts, but they are responsible for any exclusions, deductibles, co-payments or coinsurance features of their coverage.

Clinical and Operating Systems 
 We have developed a number of tools to track and compare results from our affiliated facilities and across our network. We believe these systems are an important strength and provide us data to improve results, training and efficiency across our affiliated facilities. 
 Our clinical systems allow detailed benchmarking of clinical outcomes endorsed by the National Quality Forum, patient satisfaction and accreditation inspection readiness. We have extensive tools to prepare for regulatory surveys. We strongly encourage all of our ASCs and surgical hospitals to seek and to maintain accreditation by an independent agency, either The Joint Commission or the AAAHC. All of our facilities that have sought such accreditation have successfully completed the survey process and have received a three-year term of accreditation, which is only provided after the accrediting organization has concluded that the facility is in substantial compliance with the relevant organizational standards. Our clinical resource system, the CEU, offers best practice tools and education programs tailored to our approximately 3,700 clinical teammates, as of December 31, 2016, across the country. 
 Our operating systems provide detailed benchmarking of key operational measures (including on-time starts, turn-times, staffing ratios and supply expense metrics). Management uses these tools to measure operating results against target thresholds and to identify, monitor and adjust areas such as case mix, staffing, operating costs, teammate expenses and accounts receivable management. 
 Our SCA InsightTM operating system provides detailed labor cost, supply cost and contribution margin data by procedure code, physician, facility and payor. This SCA InsightTM data allows us to work with our physicians to benchmark their performance on a detailed level and show them precise steps they can take to optimize clinical, operational and financial results. We also have a dedicated supply chain team that works with our facilities and affiliated physicians across the country to aggregate the approximately $458 million spent on surgical supplies in 2016 and to use that purchasing power to negotiate more favorable company-wide contracts with vendors. 
 Our detailed data also allows us to work in partnership with health plans to optimize the cost of surgery for their covered members. Surgery is one of the largest components of medical costs, typically representing approximately 30% of total medical spending for individuals with commercial insurance, according to our estimates. Because of this, we are increasingly focused on working with commercial health plans, Medicare Advantage plans and capitated physician groups to help them reduce the total medical spend (or rate of medical spend growth) while maintaining or improving the quality of care and the patient experience offered to their respective patient populations. 
 Facility Level Ownership Structure 
 Almost all of our affiliated facilities are owned in partnership with local physicians. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 3,000 physician partners. While the amount of physician ownership in our facilities ranges widely based on local market conditions, it typically ranges from 25% to 55%. When we partner with a health system in a three-way joint venture with physicians, we typically hold a non-controlling ownership interest in a holding company that owns a majority or controlling ownership interest in the facility, and the health system partner holds the controlling interest in the holding company. 
 Our facilities are organized as limited partnerships (“LPs”), general partnerships, limited liability companies (“LLCs”) or limited liability partnerships (“LLPs”). In ventures that do not include a health system partner, we typically serve as the general partner (or its equivalent) of the entity, as well as the day-to-day manager of the facility owned by the entity. In our three-way joint ventures that include a health system partner, we typically serve as a noncontrolling member of an LLC that is co-owned with the health system, and that LLC serves as the general partner (or its equivalent) of the facility. In such three-way ventures, we typically enter into a management agreement to handle most of the day-to-day management functions for the facilities owned by the LLC, and the health system negotiates fee schedules with payors and provides other miscellaneous services. 
 Our affiliated facilities typically pay a monthly management fee to us and, where we have an ownership interest, a monthly or quarterly pro rata distribution of cash in excess of current obligations, less amounts held in reserve for working capital and certain other anticipated expenditures. The partnership and LLC agreements typically provide for, among other things, limited voting rights for our limited partners and limited rights to transfer ownership interests. We have developed a “model” agreement that includes provisions to restrict a physician partner from owning an interest in a competing ASC or surgical hospital during the period in which the physician owns an interest in our facility and for a period of two years after they no longer own an interest in our facility. Similarly, our model agreement for ASCs requires our physician partners to certify that they are using the applicable facility in a way that is consistent with the regulatory guidance on what constitutes use of the facility as an “extension of their office practice.” In multi-specialty ASCs, this means, among other things, that at least one-third of their eligible cases must be performed at our facility. These provisions give us (or our health system partner) the right to repurchase equity from physician partners who do not meet this threshold. Our agreements also typically give us the right, but do not require us, to repurchase equity interests from physician partners who retire or trigger certain other repurchase provisions in the agreements. However, some of our agreements do not include some or any of these model provisions. 
 11

Many of our operating agreements have termination dates upon which the agreement expires by its terms.  Most of these termination dates are many years in the future. In situations where a termination date is approaching, if we wish to continue the business, we attempt to negotiate an extension of the agreement. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Certain of our partnership and operating agreements contain termination dates that will require us to amend and possibly renegotiate such agreements if we want to continue the business.” 
 In addition, certain of our agreements contain provisions that give our partners or other members rights that include, but are not limited to, rights to purchase our interest, rights to require us to purchase the interests of our partners or other members, or rights requiring the consent of our partners and other members prior to our transferring our ownership interest in a facility, or prior to a change in control of us or certain of our subsidiaries. 
 Almost all of our partnership and operating agreements contain restrictions on actions that we can take, even though we may be the general partner or the managing member, including rights of our partners and other members to approve the sale of substantially all of the assets of the entity, to dissolve the partnership or LLC and to amend the partnership or operating agreement. Many of our agreements also restrict our ability in certain instances to compete with our existing facilities or with our partners. Where we hold only a limited partner or a non-managing member interest, the general partner or managing member may take certain actions without our consent, although we typically have certain protective rights to approve major decisions, such as the sale of substantially all of the assets of the entity, the dissolution of the partnership or LLC and the amendment of the partnership or operating agreement. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Certain of our partnership and operating agreements contain provisions giving rights to our partners and other members that may be adverse to our interests.” 
 Further, some of our partnership and LLC agreements provide that the partnership, LLC, general partner or managing member, as applicable, will purchase all of the physicians’ ownership interests at fair market value if certain regulatory events occur, including, for example, if it becomes illegal for the physicians to own an interest in a facility, refer patients to a facility or receive cash distributions from a facility. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Healthcare Regulation — If laws or regulations governing physician ownership of our facilities change, we may be obligated to purchase some or all of the ownership interests of our physician partners or renegotiate some of our partnership and operating agreements with our physician partners and management agreements with our surgical facilities.” From time to time, we may extend loans to the partnerships or LLCs on commercially reasonable and fair market value terms in order to fund capital expenditures, leasehold improvements or other cash requirements. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — We make significant loans to the partnerships and LLCs that own and operate certain of our facilities.” 
 Resyndications 
 We periodically provide physicians who use our facilities the opportunity to purchase ownership interests (or increase their ownership interests) in those facilities, which we call “resyndication.” We believe that periodic resyndication of ownership interests helps our facilities maintain a core group of physicians who actively use the facility as an extension of their office practice and are incentivized to ensure that the facilities make the necessary investments and follow the necessary practices to provide high-quality and cost-efficient patient care services. 
 In addition to selling our equity interest, a key component of our resyndication strategy is repurchasing equity interests from existing physician partners and re-selling that equity to non-partner physicians or to other existing physician partners. Where feasible, we seek to redistribute equity from existing to new physician partners before selling our own equity or new equity in our facilities. However, we will continue to sell portions of our existing ownership where we believe it is in our overall best interest. 
 Case and Payor Mix 
 We seek to maintain diversity of case mix in our portfolio to insulate us from potential negative effects that could stem from emphasizing one particular case type. The following chart breaks down our consolidated net patient revenues by specialty and by type of payor for the year-ended December 31, 2016. 
 12


 
Case Mix | | | | Payor Mix | | | 
-----------------+--------------+-----+---+---------------------------------------+--------------+-----+--
 | YEAR-ENDED | | | | YEAR-ENDED | 
 | DECEMBER 31, | | | | DECEMBER 31, | 
 | 2016 | | | | 2016 | 
Orthopedic | | 31 | % | Managed care and other discount plans | | 66 | %
Ophthalmology | | 14 | | Medicare | | 20 | 
Gastroenterology | | 13 | | Workers’ compensation | | 7 | 
ENT | | 8 | | Patients and other third-party payors | | 4 | 
Pain | | 7 | | Medicaid | | 3 | 
General Surgery | | 27 | | | | | 
Total | | 100 | % | Total | | 100 | %

Seasonality 
 In recent years, our facilities have experienced a disproportionate allocation of payor mix throughout the year. Our facilities typically see a relatively higher percentage of patients with governmental health insurance in the first half of the year and a relatively higher percentage of patients with commercial health insurance in the second half of the year. We believe this pattern is a result of the continuing trend of commercial health plans and employer sponsored benefit plans increasing annual patient deductibles which is in turn causing some patients to delay surgery until later in the year, after their higher deductible has been met.

(1) | Facilities noted as acquired on June 29, 2007, August 17, 2007, August 22, 2007, February 1, 2008 and November 1, 2009 were all acquired as part of the purchase of our company in 2007 by TPG and certain co-investors. The facilities that are listed as acquired after June 2007 were carved out of the initial acquisition closing, and were acquired upon completion of certain post-closing matters.

(2) | Includes operating rooms (“ORs”) and procedure rooms (“PRs”) for ASCs and surgical hospitals.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Many of our facilities are held through one or more intermediate holding companies. These intermediate holding companies are typically structured to be owned jointly with our partners, resulting in partial ownership of the intermediate holding company by us. The intermediate holding company itself typically only owns a portion of the facility, with the remaining portion owned by others, including our physician partners. Our beneficial ownership percentage presented in the table above represents our percentage of ownership in the facility as calculated by multiplying our percentage of ownership in the intermediate holding company by the intermediate holding company’s percentage of ownership in the facility.

(5) | We do not currently hold an equity ownership interest in this facility. Instead, we hold a promissory note that is convertible into equity. The percentage represents what our beneficial ownership percentage will be upon conversion of the promissory note. Because this promissory note provides us with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this entity, we consolidate this facility into our financial results, as it meets the requirements to be a variable interest entity (“VIE”). See Note 3 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Variable Interest Entities” of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

 We lease the majority of the facilities where our ASCs and surgical hospitals conduct their operations from third parties. The terms of these leases generally range in length from ten to fifteen years, and many of our leases contain options to incrementally extend the lease period. In many cases, these leases are currently in the extension period. Many facility leases include provisions for rent escalation to recognize increased operating costs or require us to pay certain maintenance and utility costs. Certain leases contain annual escalation clauses based on changes in the Consumer Price Index, while others have fixed escalation terms. In addition, in the normal course of operations, several of our leases will be set to expire during any calendar year. We do not expect difficulties in locating comparable facilities should we choose not to, or be otherwise unable to, extend one or more of our existing leases. Our leases do not typically provide for early termination rights in the absence of a tenant default. 
 
Our headquarters is located in Deerfield, Illinois at 510 Lake Cook Road, Suite 400, where we currently lease approximately 28,410 square feet of space. This lease expires in March 2027. We also have corporate offices in Birmingham, Alabama, Irving, Texas, Pasadena, California and Stamford, Connecticut. Our Birmingham office is located at 569 Brookwood Village, Suite 901, where we currently lease approximately 47,870 square feet of space. This lease expires in March 2025. 
 Acquisitions and Strategic Relationships 
 We pursue our growth strategy in the ASC and surgical hospital markets by making selective investments in existing surgical facilities and groups of facilities. We actively seek opportunities where there are identifiable profit growth opportunities based on location, market dynamics and case mix, and where we can partner with committed physicians who are motivated to improve their facilities. 
 Our growth strategy includes building strategic partnerships with health plans, medical groups and health systems to invest in, develop and optimize facilities in an aligned economic model that enables better access to high-quality care at lower cost. We believe that our partnership strategy and comprehensive suite of solutions will enable continued growth by capitalizing on increasing demand for high quality, cost-effective settings of care, the increasing need for scaled partners in healthcare, the transition to a coordinated care delivery model and the trend of physician and health system consolidation. 
 20

Marketing 
 Our sales and marketing efforts are directed primarily at physicians, who are principally responsible for referring patients to our facilities. We market our facilities to physicians by emphasizing: (1) the high level of patient satisfaction with our facilities, which is based on patient surveys that we administer concerning our facilities, (2) the quality and responsiveness of our services, and (3) the practice efficiencies provided by our facilities. In those markets in which we have partnered with a health system, we coordinate the marketing effort with the health system and generally benefit from this strategy. We and our health system partners also directly negotiate agreements with commercial health plans, which generally focus on the pricing in a particular market. 
Competition 
 In each of our markets we face competition from other providers of ambulatory surgical care in developing ASC and surgical hospital joint ventures, acquiring existing facilities, attracting patients and negotiating commercial health plan contract pricing. We believe we are the third largest ASC operator in the United States, based on the number of facilities operated. Tenet Healthcare Corp., AmSurg Corp., HCA Healthcare Corporation and Surgery Partners are the other largest national ASC operators. However, due to industry fragmentation, we commonly compete for business with hospitals partnering with physicians or with local physician groups who develop independent ASCs without a corporate partner, including those who use consultants to perform management services for a fee without an ongoing equity interest. We believe we compete effectively because of our size, quality of management services, experience and reputation for providing quality care. 
 We often compete with other healthcare providers that provide outpatient procedures. In particular, we compete with the outpatient departments of acute care hospitals, which often perform the same procedures as we do in our freestanding facilities. We believe that, in comparison to acute care hospitals, our ASCs and surgical hospitals compete favorably on the basis of cost, quality, efficiency and responsiveness to physician needs in a more comfortable and convenient environment for the patient. To a lesser but growing extent, we also face competition from physicians performing less complex outpatient procedures, such as pain management and certain gastrointestinal procedures, in their own offices. 
 Teammates 
 As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 6,000 full-time equivalent teammates, working in all of our affiliated facilities. While each facility varies depending on its size, case volume and case types, we employ an average of approximately 30 full-time equivalent teammates at our ASCs, and an average of approximately 90 full-time equivalent teammates at our surgical hospitals. While we provide “full-time equivalent” information, a number of our teammates work on flexible schedules rather than full-time, which increases our staffing efficiency. As a result, these teammates also do not participate in our benefits structure, which we believe reduces the relative cost of our benefits plans to us. 
 With limited exceptions, the physicians who use our affiliated facilities are not employees of either SCA or the facility. None of our teammates are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. 
 Regulatory Compliance Program 
 It is our policy to conduct our business with integrity and in compliance with the law. We have in place and continue to enhance a company-wide compliance program that focuses on all areas of regulatory compliance, including coding, billing, cost reporting practices, HIPAA compliance and contractual arrangements with referral sources. 
 This regulatory compliance program is intended to help ensure that high standards of conduct are maintained in the operation of our business and that policies and procedures are implemented so that teammates act in full compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and company policies. Under the regulatory compliance program, every teammate and certain contractors involved in patient care and coding and billing receive initial and periodic legal compliance and ethics training. In addition, we regularly monitor our ongoing compliance efforts and develop and implement policies and procedures designed to foster compliance with the law. The program also includes a mechanism for teammates to report, without fear of retaliation, any suspected legal or ethical violations to their supervisors, designated compliance officers in our facilities, our compliance hotline or directly to our compliance officer. We believe our compliance program is consistent with standard industry practices. However, we cannot provide any assurances that our compliance program will detect all violations of law or protect against qui tam suits or government enforcement actions.  At some of our affiliated facilities, another partner, such as a health system, maintains the compliance program instead of SCA. 
 21

Government Regulation 
 The healthcare industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governments. Government regulation affects our business by, among other things, controlling growth, requiring licensing or certification of facilities, regulating how facilities are used and controlling payment for services provided. Our ability to conduct our business and to operate profitably will depend in part upon complying with applicable laws and regulations. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related To Healthcare Regulation.” 
Licensure, Accreditation and Certificate of Need Regulations 
 Our facilities are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local licensing requirements.  These requirements relate to the adequacy and quality of patient care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, fire prevention and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. Governmental and other authorities periodically inspect our facilities to verify continued compliance with these regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the suspension or revocation of a facility’s license or other penalties. 
 As of December 31, 2016, the vast majority of our facilities were accredited by either The Joint Commission or the AAAHC, two of the major national organizations that establish standards relating to the physical plant, administration, quality of patient care and operation of medical staffs of various types of healthcare facilities. The effect of accreditation by these organizations is to exempt the facilities from routine surveys by state agencies to determine compliance with Medicare conditions.  These accredited facilities are subject to periodic surveys by the accrediting organization to ensure that they are in compliance with the applicable standards. Many commercial health plans require our facilities to be accredited in order to be participating providers.  Failure to maintain accreditation would cause a facility to become subject to state survey agency oversight and potentially subject to increased scrutiny by CMS, and could result in a loss of payment from commercial health plans. 
 Capital expenditures for the construction of new facilities, the addition of capacity or the acquisition, relocation, change of ownership or change of control of existing facilities may be reviewable by state regulators under certificate of need (“CON”) laws. A CON is a permit issued by a state health planning authority certifying that a proposed facility or expansion is consistent with the need for the services to be offered by the facility. States with CON laws often place limits on the number of facilities or operating rooms in a region, or restrict providers’ ability to build, relocate, expand or change the ownership control of healthcare facilities and services. Some states require CON approvals to establish or modify ASCs and surgical hospitals. Failure to obtain necessary CON approval can prevent a provider from expanding facilities, adding services or completing an investment in a new facility. Violations of CON laws may result in civil sanctions or the revocation of a facility’s license. As of December 31, 2016, we operated in 24 states with a CON program.  In some cases, these CON programs may impose requirements that apply to our transactions and operations. 
 Medicare and Medicaid Programs 
 Medicare is a federally funded and administered health insurance program that primarily serves individuals entitled to social security benefits who are age 65 years or older or who are disabled. Medicare prospectively determines fixed payment amounts for procedures performed at ASCs and hospitals and updates these amounts annually. These amounts are adjusted for regional wage variations. For the years-ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately 20%, 19% and 20%, respectively, of our net patient revenues were attributable to Medicare payments. 
 To participate in the Medicare program and receive Medicare payments, our facilities must comply with regulations promulgated by CMS. Among other things, these regulations, known as “conditions for coverage” for ASCs and “conditions of participation” for hospitals, set forth requirements relating to a facility’s equipment, personnel, policies, standards of medical care and compliance with state and local laws and regulations. All of our ASCs and surgical hospitals are certified in the Medicare program and are subject to unannounced, on-site surveys by state agencies working on behalf of CMS. The frequency of on-site ASC surveys by state agencies has increased in recent years. Failure to comply with Medicare’s conditions for coverage and conditions of participation may result in loss of payment or other governmental sanctions, including termination of participation in the Medicare program. We have established ongoing quality assurance activities to monitor our facilities’ compliance with these conditions. 
 Medicaid is a health insurance program jointly funded by federal and state governments that provides medical assistance to qualifying low-income persons. Medicaid programs are administered by states under federally-approved plans.  Both the payment methodology and the amounts paid for services vary from state to state.  Each state Medicaid program has the option to provide payment for ASC services. All of the states in which we currently operate provide Medicaid coverage for some ASC services; however, these states may elect to discontinue covering services, and states into which we expand our operations may not cover or continue to cover ASC services. For the years-ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately 3% of our net patient revenues were attributable to Medicaid payments. 
 22

Health Reform Initiatives 
 There have been numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives on the federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for and availability of healthcare services. Most notably, the Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Reform Law”), was enacted in March 2010 and has resulted in significant change for the healthcare industry.  Although the Health Reform Law has resulted in major changes in healthcare coverage, delivery, and payment, its long-term effect is unclear, particularly in the wake of the fall 2016 election cycle, which resulted in a Republican president and Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. The Health Reform Law has changed and continues to change how healthcare services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through, among other things, expanded coverage of uninsured individuals, reduced growth in Medicare program spending and the establishment and expansion of programs tying reimbursement to quality and clinical integration. The Health Reform Law also reforms certain aspects of health insurance, quality of care and fraud and abuse enforcement. As currently structured, the Health Reform Law includes a number of reforms that directly affect our facilities, including, without limitation, those summarized below. 
 One of the central aims of the Health Reform Law is to reduce the number of uninsured individuals by increasing coverage through various avenues.  Medicaid is the primary public program through which the Health Reform Law has expanded coverage. The Health Reform Law broadens the categories of individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage and permits individuals with relatively higher incomes to qualify. The Health Reform Law requires all state Medicaid programs to provide, and the Federal government to subsidize, Medicaid coverage to virtually all adults under 65 years old with incomes at or under 133% of the federal poverty level. However, following a June 2012 decision of the United States Supreme Court, states may opt out of the expansion without losing existing federal Medicaid funding.  For those states that expand Medicaid coverage, the Health Reform Law also requires that a “5% income disregard” be added to the Medicaid eligibility standard, effectively extending Medicaid eligibility to those with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level.  Some states have chosen not to implement the Medicaid expansion at this time; however, these states could choose to implement the expansion at a later date. 
 In the private sector, the Health Reform Law has expanded health insurance coverage through a range of requirements applicable to health insurers, employers and individuals. For example, health insurers are now prohibited from imposing annual coverage limits, dropping coverage, excluding individuals on the basis of pre-existing conditions or denying coverage for any individual who is willing to pay the premiums for such coverage. In addition, individuals must maintain a minimum level of health insurance coverage or pay a tax penalty, subject to certain exceptions.  To facilitate the purchase of health insurance, the Health Reform Law mandated the establishment of the Health Insurance Marketplace, a system of state and federal health insurance exchanges through which qualified health insurance coverage may be obtained.  Further, certain larger employers that do not offer health insurance benefits to their full-time employees are required to make “shared responsibility payments” if an employee obtains government-subsidized coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. 
 The Health Reform Law also provides for reductions in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare program spending. The Health Reform Law includes a provision requiring CMS to apply a negative productivity adjustment to the indexes used to update Medicare payment rates each year. The productivity adjustment is equal to the 10-year moving average of changes in the annual economy-wide private nonfarm business multi-factor productivity measure, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics each year. Hospital and ASC services have been subject to this productivity adjustment since 2011. The practical impact of the productivity adjustment for hospital and ASC services is to reduce the amount of annual rate increases from Medicare, potentially to an amount below zero (that is, if the productivity adjustment outweighs the index-based rate increase, reimbursement rates will decline). In addition to the productivity adjustment for hospital and ASC services, the Health Reform Law requires a downward adjustment in payment for hospital services of 0.75% in federal fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019. 
 Additionally, the Health Reform Law directed the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to develop a plan to implement a value-based purchasing program for ASCs. While HHS submitted a report to Congress in 2011 outlining efforts to improve quality and payment efficiency in ASCs and examining the steps required to design and implement an ASC value-based purchasing program, Congress has not yet authorized CMS to implement the program. However, CMS has implemented a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services, pursuant to which hospitals that meet or exceed specified quality performance standards will receive greater reimbursement than they would have otherwise and hospitals that do not meet the standards will receive reduced payments. The Health Reform Law also provides for other quality-based payment adjustments for inpatient hospital services, including reductions for “excess readmissions” for certain conditions and for high rates of hospital-acquired conditions. 
 The Health Reform Law also makes several significant changes to healthcare fraud and abuse laws, provides additional enforcement tools to the government, facilitates cooperation between agencies by establishing mechanisms for the sharing of information and enhances criminal and administrative penalties for non-compliance. For example, the Health Reform Law provides Medicare contractors with additional flexibility to conduct random prepayment reviews; authorizes HHS, in consultation with the HHS Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), to suspend Medicare and Medicaid payments to a provider of services or supplier pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud; and expands liability under the federal False Claims Act (the “FCA”) for failure to timely repay identified overpayments made by governmental healthcare programs. 
 23

To date, we have not experienced a material impact on our results from these various changes related to the Health Reform Law. However, we believe healthcare reform initiatives will continue to develop during the foreseeable future. These initiatives, which may include some previously proposed reforms, such as further reductions in Medicare or Medicaid payments, or additional prohibitions on physicians’ financial relationships with facilities to which they refer patients, could adversely affect us in a material way.  The outcome of the fall 2016 election cycle has reinvigorated efforts to repeal or significantly modify the Health Reform Law.  In addition, the election results are likely to affect the implementation of the Health Reform Law.  Shortly after being inaugurated in 2017, the President signed an executive order stating his administration’s policy to seek prompt repeal of the Health Reform Law and directing the Secretary of HHS and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of provisions of the Health Reform Law that impose a fiscal or regulatory burden.  These changes create substantial uncertainty regarding the future of the Health Reform Law and the potential effects of any legislation that replaces or modifies the Health Reform Law.
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute 
 Federal and state laws regulate relationships among providers of healthcare services, including employment or service contracts and investment relationships. These restrictions include a federal criminal law, referred to as the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration in return for, or to induce, referrals of items or services reimbursable by a federal healthcare program. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, civil money penalties of up to $74,792 per violation (which civil money penalties will be updated annually based on changes to the Consumer Price Index) and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration, as well as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The Health Reform Law provides that submission of a claim for services or items provided in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim and may be subject to additional penalties under the FCA. 
 The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad in scope and the applicability of its provisions to many business transactions in the healthcare industry has not yet been subject to judicial or regulatory interpretation. The method by which investors are selected and bought out, the pricing of the issuance and redemption of partnership or LLC units to or from referring physicians and all of our other financial dealings with physicians are subject to regulation by the Anti-Kickback Statute. Courts have found a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. Furthermore, the Health Reform Law provides that knowledge of the law or intent to violate the law is not required to establish a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. 
 The Federal government scrutinizes joint ventures and other transactions among healthcare providers, particularly joint ventures involving physicians and other referral sources. In 1989, the OIG published a fraud alert that outlined questionable features of “suspect” joint ventures, and the OIG has continued to refer to these features in later pronouncements. The OIG has also published regulations containing numerous “safe harbors” that exempt some practices from enforcement under the Anti-Kickback Statute. These safe harbor regulations, if fully complied with, assure participants in particular types of arrangements that the OIG will not treat their participation as a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. The safe harbor regulations do not expand the scope of activities that the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, nor do they provide that failure to satisfy the terms of a safe harbor constitutes a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. The OIG has, however, indicated that failure to satisfy the terms of a safe harbor may subject an arrangement to increased scrutiny. 
 The OIG has promulgated a safe harbor applicable to ASCs. The ASC safe harbor generally protects ownership or investment interests in a center by physicians who are in a position to refer patients directly to the center and perform procedures at the center on referred patients, if certain conditions are met. More specifically, the ASC safe harbor protects any payment that is a return on an ownership or investment interest to an investor if certain standards are met in one of four categories of ASCs: (1) surgeon-owned surgery centers; (2) single-specialty surgery centers; (3) multi-specialty surgery centers; and (4) hospital/physician surgery centers. 
 Surgeon-owned surgery centers are those in which all of the physician investors are either general surgeons or surgeons engaged in the same surgical specialty. Single-specialty surgery centers are those in which all of the physician investors — who do not need to be surgeons but who must perform procedures — are engaged in the same medical practice specialty. A gastroenterologist is an example of a physician who is not a surgeon but who performs procedures; an ASC owned exclusively by gastroenterologists and which accepts only gastroenterology procedures is an example of a single-specialty surgery center. Multi-specialty surgery centers may include a mix of physicians (surgeons and non-surgeons) in different specialties. Hospital/physician surgery centers must include at least one hospital investor. 
 24

Although the ASC safe harbor sets forth four separate categories, many of the same requirements apply to each category. For example, in each case, no ownership interests may be held by a non-physician or non-hospital investor if that investor is employed by the center or another investor, in a position to provide items or services to the center or any of its other investors or in a position to make or influence referrals directly or indirectly to the center or any of its investors. In addition, in the case of surgeon-owned, single-specialty, and multi-specialty surgery centers, at least one-third of each physician investor’s medical practice income from all sources for the previous fiscal year or 12-month period must be derived from performing outpatient procedures on the list of Medicare covered procedures for ASCs. For multi-specialty surgery centers, the safe harbor also requires that at least one-third of the Medicare-eligible outpatient surgery procedures performed by each physician investor for the previous fiscal year or 12-month period must be performed at the surgery center in which the investment is made. For hospital/physician surgery centers, the safe harbor includes standards that prohibit the hospital investor and the center from sharing space and equipment except in certain instances, prohibit the hospital investor from including costs associated with the center on the hospital’s cost report, and prohibit the hospital from being in a position to make or influence referrals to the center or to any other investor in the center. 
 Entities that own facilities which provide services reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, and their respective physician partners and members, are subject to the Anti-Kickback Statute. In cases where one of our subsidiaries is an investor in the partnership or LLC that owns a facility, and we or our subsidiary provides management and other services to the facility, our arrangements with physician investors likely do not meet all of the specific terms of the ASC safe harbor or any other safe harbor. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Healthcare Regulation — The ownership arrangements at our surgical facilities likely do not satisfy the requirements for any of the safe harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute.  If we fail to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, loss of licenses and exclusion from governmental programs, which may result in a substantial loss of revenues.” 
 However, we believe that our operations do not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. Moreover, we strive to ensure that our management services agreements, lease agreements and other agreements with potential referral sources are consistent with our standards for documented fair market value for services and space provided to or received from the facilities or the physician partners at the facilities. 
 Federal Physician Self-Referral Law 
 Section 1877 of the Social Security Act, the federal physician self-referral law commonly referred to as the “Stark Law,” prohibits a physician from referring patients to any entity for the furnishing of certain “designated health services” otherwise payable by Medicare, if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship with the entity, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated health services otherwise payable by Medicare from billing the Medicare program for any items or services that result from a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the prohibited referral. As defined by the Stark Law, the term “financial relationship” includes both ownership (or investment) interests and compensation arrangements. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute with which compliance is voluntary, a financial relationship must comply with every requirement of a Stark Law exception in order to not violate the Stark Law. Intent does not have to be proven to establish a violation of the Stark Law.  Persons who violate the Stark Law are subject to various sanctions, including denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to $24,253 for each claim submitted, and potential exclusion from federal healthcare programs. The Stark Law also provides for a penalty of up to $161,692 for a scheme intended to circumvent the Stark Law prohibitions. These civil monetary penalties will be updated annually based on changes to the Consumer Price Index. In addition to these penalties, failure to refund Medicare payments received as a result of a referral prohibited by the Stark Law on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the FCA. 
 CMS has promulgated regulations to implement the Stark Law. Under these regulations, services provided by an ASC that would otherwise constitute “designated health services” are excluded from the definition of that term if the services are reimbursed by Medicare as part of the ASC’s composite payment rate. All services provided by our ASCs that would otherwise constitute designated health services are reimbursed by Medicare as part of the composite payment rate and are thus excepted from the Stark Law, with the exception of implants. The Stark Law provides for a special exception for implants, such as intraocular lenses and artificial joints, furnished in ASCs as long as certain regulatory requirements are met. These requirements provide that: (1) the implant be implanted by the referring physician or a member of his or her group practice; (2) the implant be implanted during a surgical procedure reimbursed as an ASC procedure by Medicare; (3) the arrangement for the furnishing of the implant not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute; and (4) the billing for the implant be conducted legally. We believe the operations of our ASCs comply with these requirements and, consequently, that the Stark Law generally does not apply to services provided by our ASCs. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Healthcare Regulation — If we fail to comply with physician self-referral laws as they are currently interpreted or may be interpreted in the future, or if other legislative restrictions are issued, we could incur substantial monetary penalties and a significant loss of revenues.” 
 25

In contrast, the Stark Law does apply to inpatient and outpatient hospital services. The Stark Law includes exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between hospitals and physicians, including professional services agreements and lease agreements.  The Stark Law also includes an exception that permits physicians to refer Medicare patients to hospitals in which they have an ownership interest if certain requirements are met. As of December 31, 2016, seven of our facilities were surgical hospitals, all of which were partially owned by physicians. While the Health Reform Law dramatically curtailed this exception and prohibits physician ownership in hospitals that did not have a Medicare provider agreement by December 31, 2010, this prohibition does not apply to any of our surgical hospitals with physician ownership because each of them had a Medicare provider agreement prior to December 31, 2010 and are therefore able to continue operating with their existing ownership structure in compliance with the applicable exception. However, the law prohibits “grandfathered” hospitals from increasing the percentage of physician ownership, and the law limits to a certain extent their ability to grow because it prohibits such hospitals from increasing the aggregate number of inpatient beds, operating rooms and procedure rooms, subject to limited exceptions. In addition, the law requires all surgical hospitals with physician owners to adopt certain measures to address potential conflicts of interest, ensure that physician investments are bona fide and ensure patient safety. We believe our facilities are in compliance with such requirements, but even the assertion of a violation of the Stark Law could have a material adverse effect upon us. 
 False and Other Improper Claims 
 The Federal government is authorized to impose criminal, civil and administrative penalties on any person or entity that files a false claim for payment from federal healthcare programs. False claims filed with private insurers can also lead to criminal and civil penalties. While the criminal statutes are generally reserved for instances of fraudulent intent, the government applies criminal, civil and administrative penalty statutes to a range of circumstances, including coding errors, billing for services not provided, billing for services that are not medically necessary, improperly classifying the level of care provided, submitting false cost reports, submitting claims resulting from arrangements prohibited by the Stark Law or the Anti-Kickback Statute, and failing to timely report and return an overpayment received from the government. Over the past decade or more, the government has accused an increasing number of healthcare providers of violating the FCA, which prohibits a person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim to the United States. The statute defines “knowingly” to include not only actual knowledge of a claim’s falsity, but also reckless disregard for or intentional ignorance of the truth or falsity of a claim. Violations of the FCA can result in damage awards equal to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,957 and $21,916 for each separate false claim. These civil monetary penalties will increase annually based on updates to the Consumer Price Index. 
 Also, under the “qui tam” provisions of the FCA, private parties (“relators” or “whistleblowers”) may bring actions against providers on behalf of the Federal government. Such private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government through trial or settlement. Qui tam cases are sealed by the court at the time of filing. The only parties privy to the information contained in the complaint are the relator, the Federal government and the presiding court. 
 Both direct enforcement activity by the government and whistleblower lawsuits under the FCA have increased significantly in recent years, which has increased the risk that we may have to defend a false claims action, repay claims paid by the government, pay fines or be excluded from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, under the Health Reform Law, if we receive an overpayment, we must report and refund the overpayments before the later of 60 days after the overpayment was identified or the date a corresponding cost report is due, if applicable. Any overpayment that is retained after this deadline is considered an obligation subject to an action under the FCA. 
 Although we believe that our operations materially comply with federal and state laws, they may nevertheless be the subject of a whistleblower lawsuit, or may otherwise be challenged or scrutinized by governmental authorities. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Healthcare Regulation — Companies within the healthcare industry continue to be the subject of federal and state audits, investigations and lawsuits, and we may be subject to such audits, investigations and lawsuits, including actions for false and other improper claims.” 
 State Anti-Kickback, Physician Self-Referral and False Claims Laws 
 Many states, including those in which we do business, have laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute and Stark Law that prohibit payment of kickbacks or other remuneration in return for the referral of patients. Some of these laws apply only to services reimbursable under state Medicaid programs. In most states, these laws have not been subjected to significant judicial and regulatory interpretation. Noncompliance with these laws could subject us to penalties and sanctions and have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe that our operations are in material compliance with the anti-kickback and physician self-referral laws of the states in which our facilities are located. 
 26

Similarly, a number of states, including some of those in which we do business, have their own laws prohibiting the submission of false claims. These laws may be modeled on the FCA and contain qui tam provisions. Some state false claims acts are broader than their federal counterpart in terms of the amount losing defendants must pay or the types of claims that are subject to the act.  In many cases, little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws. 
 Healthcare Industry Investigations and Audits 
 Federal and state government agencies have increased their civil and criminal enforcement efforts in the healthcare industry. For example, the Health Reform Law added $350 million of federal funding to fight healthcare fraud, waste and abuse. Investigations by government agencies have addressed a wide variety of issues, including billing practices and financial arrangements with referral sources. In addition, the OIG and the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) have, from time to time, established national enforcement initiatives that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse. An investigation of our facilities could result in significant costs, liabilities and penalties, as well as adverse publicity. 
 In addition, government agencies and their agents may conduct audits of the operations of our facilities. Under the Recovery Audit Program, CMS contracts with Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”) on a contingency basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper Medicare payments. The Health Reform Law expanded the scope of the Recovery Audit Program to include Medicaid claims by requiring all states to enter into contracts with RACs to audit payments to Medicaid providers. In addition to RACs, other contractors, such as Medicare Administrative Contractors, Zone Program Integrity Contractors and Medicaid Integrity Contractors (“MICs”), perform payment audits to identify and correct improper payments. 
 Health Information Privacy and Security Requirements 
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) requires covered entities, including most healthcare providers, to employ systems and procedures designed to protect individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information.” Pursuant to HIPAA, HHS has promulgated privacy and security regulations that extensively regulate the use and disclosure of protected health information and require covered entities to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Entities that handle protected health information on behalf of covered entities (known as “business associates”) or on behalf of other business associates must comply with most provisions of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations and are subject to civil and criminal penalties for violations of these regulations.  A covered entity may be penalized for the HIPAA violation of its business associate if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity.  As covered entities under HIPAA, our facilities are required to comply with rules governing the use and disclosure of protected health information and to impose those rules, by contract, on any business associate to which such information is disclosed. In other relationships, such as when we provide management or consulting services to another covered entity, we are subject to the rules applicable to business associates. 
 Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 days after the discovery of the breach by the covered entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information. 
 Our facilities and we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in order to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. Violations of these regulations may result in civil and criminal penalties. In addition, state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents.  Further, HHS is required to perform compliance audits, which may result in increased enforcement activity. 
 States may impose more protective privacy and security laws, and both state and federal laws are subject to modification or enhancement of privacy and security protection at any time. Our facilities will continue to remain subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These statutes vary and could impose additional requirements on us and more severe penalties for breaches of privacy. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches.
 27

HIPAA Transactions and Code Sets Standards 
 HIPAA and its implementing regulations establish electronic data transmission standards that all healthcare providers must use for certain electronic healthcare transactions, such as submitting claims for payment for medical services. The Health Reform Law requires the adoption of standards for additional electronic transactions and provides for the creation of operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction. In addition, all healthcare providers covered by HIPAA were required to transition, by October 1, 2015, to updated standard code sets to report certain diagnoses and procedures, known as ICD-10 code sets. 
Federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act 
 The Federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”) applies to our seven surgical hospitals. EMTALA requires hospitals participating in the Medicare program, including those without emergency rooms, to evaluate individuals who present with emergencies, provide initial stabilizing treatment and refer or transfer patients where appropriate. Sanctions for violations of EMTALA include termination of a hospital’s Medicare provider agreement, exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs and civil monetary penalties. In addition, the law creates private civil remedies that enable an individual who suffers personal harm because of a violation of the law, or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss because of another participating hospital’s violation of the law, to sue the offending hospital for damages and equitable relief. 
Antitrust Laws 
 The Federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, concerted refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the healthcare industry is currently a priority of the FTC, the DOJ and the attorneys general of certain states, including states in which we operate. 
 Some of our operating activities are subject to regulation by the antitrust laws. For example, the exchange of pricing information in connection with the creation of a joint venture or an acquisition, the formation of joint ventures with large health systems and the negotiation of our commercial health plan contracts by our health system partners are all regulated by the antitrust laws. We undertake to conduct all of our business operations in compliance with these laws. The FTC and the DOJ have promulgated a series of “Statements of Antitrust Enforcement Policy in Health Care,” which set forth several “safety zones.” A “safety zone” describes conduct that the FTC and the DOJ will not challenge under the antitrust laws, absent extraordinary circumstances. Our activities do not necessarily fall within any of these safety zones; nevertheless, we believe that our operations are in compliance with the antitrust laws. However, courts or regulatory authorities may reach a contrary conclusion, and such a conclusion could adversely affect our operations. Antitrust authorities could also attempt to restrict our ability to grow in certain markets. 
 Utilization Review 
 Federal law contains numerous provisions designed to ensure that services rendered by hospitals to Medicare and Medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards and are medically necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed. These provisions include a requirement that a sampling of Medicare and Medicaid patient cases must be reviewed by quality improvement organizations, which review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of diagnosis related group classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay or cost. Quality improvement organizations may deny payment for services provided or assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to HHS that a provider which is in substantial noncompliance with the standards of the quality improvement organization be excluded from participation in the Medicare program. 
Reimbursement 
 Medicare — Ambulatory Surgical Centers 
 Medicare establishes reimbursement methodologies for various types of healthcare facilities and services. These methodologies have historically been subject to periodic revisions that can have a substantial impact on existing healthcare providers. In accordance with authorization from Congress, CMS makes annual upward or downward adjustments to Medicare payment rates in most areas. These adjustments can result in decreases in actual dollars per procedure or a freeze in reimbursement despite increases in costs. 
 28

CMS reimburses providers for outpatient surgery performed in an ASC using a prospectively determined fee schedule. The standard payment rate for ASC-covered surgical procedures is calculated as the product of an ASC “conversion factor” and the ASC “relative payment weight” for each separately payable procedure or service. Subject to certain exclusions, covered surgical procedures in an ASC are surgical procedures that are separately paid under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“OPPS”) that would not be expected to pose a significant risk to safety when performed in an ASC, and that would not be expected to require overnight stay. Payment for ancillary items and services are packaged into ASC payment for a covered surgical procedure. The lists of, and payment rates for, covered surgical procedures and ancillary services in ASCs are updated in conjunction with the annual proposed and final rulemaking process to update the OPPS and ASC payment system. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, possible retroactive and prospective rate adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which may adversely affect the level of payments to our surgery centers. Further, the Health Reform Law added limitations on the increase in the index by which ASC rates are annually adjusted. See “— Government Regulation — Health Reform Initiatives.” For calendar year 2017, CMS increased ASC payment rates by 1.9%, reflecting an inflation update of 2.2% less a negative 0.3% productivity adjustment required by the Health Reform Law.   
 CMS has implemented a quality data reporting program for ASCs, known as the ASC Quality Reporting Program, under which ASCs are required to report data on quality measures specified by CMS each year. ASCs that fail to report on the quality measures in the form and manner required by CMS may incur a reduction in Medicare payment rates in subsequent years.  We have implemented procedures at our ASCs to comply with these reporting requirements.  
 Medicare — Surgical Hospitals 
 As of December 31, 2016, seven of our facilities are licensed as hospitals and receive reimbursement from Medicare for inpatient services under Medicare’s Inpatient Prospective Payment System, under which a hospital receives a fixed amount as reimbursement for inpatient hospital services based on each patient’s final assigned Medicare severity diagnosis-related group (“MS-DRG”). Our surgical hospitals generally focus on performing outpatient procedures and perform a relatively low number of Medicare inpatient cases. 
 Each federal fiscal year (which begins October 1), MS-DRG rates are updated and their weights are recalibrated. The index to update the MS-DRGs known as the “market basket” gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals as well as entities outside the healthcare industry in purchasing goods and services. For several years, however, the percentage increases to the prospective payment rates have been generally lower than the percentage increases in the costs of goods and services for hospitals. Further, the Health Reform Law introduced new limitations on the increase in the market basket. See “— Government Regulation — Health Reform Initiatives.” 
 Our surgical hospitals are subject to a separate Medicare payment system for outpatient services. Most outpatient services provided by surgical hospitals are classified into groups called Ambulatory Payment Classifications (“APCs”) that are reimbursed by Medicare under the OPPS. A Medicare payment rate has been established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, a hospital may be paid for more than one APC for a patient visit. For calendar year 2017, CMS has finalized payment adjustments and policy updates that it estimates will result in a 1.65% increase in payments for hospital outpatient services, reflecting a 2.7% market basket increase, a negative 0.3% productivity adjustment and a negative 0.75% adjustment required by the Health Reform Law. 
 CMS has implemented a quality data reporting program for hospital outpatient care, known as the Hospital Outpatient Quality Data Reporting Program. CMS has adopted a similar quality data reporting program for hospital inpatient services, known as the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program. Hospitals that fail to report inpatient or outpatient data required for the quality measures selected by CMS in the form and manner required by CMS may incur a 2% reduction in the annual payment update factor. If we fail to provide quality data in the manner and form required by CMS, our surgical hospitals could be subject to a reduction of the Medicare payment update by 2%. Any reduction would apply only to the payment year involved and would not be taken into account in computing the applicable payment update factor for a subsequent payment year. 
 Medicaid 
 Medicaid programs are jointly funded by Federal and state governments. As the Medicaid program is administered by the individual states under the oversight of CMS in accordance with certain regulatory and statutory guidelines, there are substantial differences in reimbursement methodologies and coverage policies from state to state. Many states have experienced shortfalls in their Medicaid budgets and are implementing significant cuts in Medicaid reimbursement rates. Additionally, certain states control Medicaid expenditures by restricting or eliminating coverage of certain services. Payments from Medicaid constituted approximately 3% of our net patient revenues for the year-ended December 31, 2016. 
 29

Cost Reports 
 Because of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and some state regulations require each of our seven surgical hospitals to submit annual cost reports stating the revenues, costs and expenses associated with the services provided to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. 
 These annual cost reports are subject to routine audits, which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. It generally takes years to settle audits of these cost reports. These audits are used for determining if any under- or over-payments were made under these programs, setting payment levels for future years and detecting fraud. Providers are required to make certain certifications with these cost report submissions, including that they are in compliance with law. Such certifications, if incorrect and submitted knowingly or recklessly, may result in FCA liability. While currently ASCs are not subject to federal cost reporting requirements, it is possible that such requirements, which could be costly for us, will be implemented by CMS in the future. 
 Third-Party Health Plans 
 In addition to paying professional fees directly to the physicians performing medical services, most third-party health plans also pay a facility fee to ASCs for the use of surgical facilities and reimburse surgical hospitals for the charges associated with the facilities and services that are provided by the hospitals to the third-party health plans’ beneficiaries. We receive a majority of our reimbursement from third-party health plans pursuant to written contracts between health plans and our facilities. These contracts generally require our ASCs and surgical hospitals to offer discounts from their established charges and prohibit us from billing the patient for any amount other than a specified co-payment or deductible. 
 In some cases, our facilities do not have written contracts prior to providing services, commonly known as “out-of-network” services. Third-party health plans have traditionally paid our out-of-network facilities a percentage of their charges. There has been a growing trend in recent years, however, for third-party health plans to implement out-of-network fee schedules, which are more comparable to our contracted rates. In addition, some states where we operate have laws which restrict “out-of-network” billing, and a few health plans have filed lawsuits claiming fraud and other wrongdoing on the part of ASCs that have engaged in certain out-of-network billing practices. We believe that where our facilities are out-of-network, our practices are appropriate, but we cannot guarantee that a health plan will not successfully challenge those practices, which could lead to lower revenues at the facility involved, as well as the payment of a significant damage award to the health plan. 
 Workers’ Compensation 
 Our facilities provide services to injured workers and receive payment from workers’ compensation plans pursuant to the various state workers’ compensation statutes. Historically, workers’ compensation plans have typically paid surgical facilities relatively higher rates than other third-party plans. However, workers’ compensation payment amounts are subject to legislative, regulatory and other payment changes over which we have no control, and in recent years, a number of states have implemented workers’ compensation fee schedules with rates generally lower than what our facilities have historically been paid for the same services. This trend has been exacerbated in some states by budget deficits and a perceived need to reduce expenditures. A reduction in workers’ compensation payment amounts could have a material adverse effect on the revenues of our facilities which perform a significant number of workers compensation cases. 
Operational Risks and Insurance 
 We maintain liability insurance in amounts that we believe are appropriate for our operations. Currently, we maintain professional and general liability insurance coverage for us and our facilities on a claims-made basis of $1.0 million per occurrence and $3.0 million in annual aggregate coverage per surgical facility. We also maintain umbrella liability insurance in the aggregate amount of $10.0 million and excess liability insurance in the aggregate amount of $15.0 million. We also currently maintain property damage insurance with aggregate coverage of $500.0 million and other types of insurance coverage we believe to be consistent with industry practice. Coverage under certain of these policies is contingent upon the policy being in effect when a claim is made regardless of when the events that caused the claim occurred.

In most states, we maintain private market coverage for our workers’ compensation risk. The policy limits equal the minimum statutory requirements. In certain states, we procure comparable coverage through various state funds. In the state of Texas, we have elected not to participate in the workers’ compensation system and have procured separate coverage, subject to nominal deductibles. 
 While we believe that our insurance policies are adequate in amount and coverage for our current and anticipated operations based on both management judgment and external benchmarks, we cannot ensure that the insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims or will continue to be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost.  For some of our affiliated facilities, these insurance coverages are provided through another partner, such as a health system, or obtained directly, outside of our program.
 Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. Our operations include the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials. We also regularly acquire ownership or operational interests in new facilities and properties, some of which may have had a history of commercial or other operations. We may incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to contamination of sites we own or operate (including contamination caused by prior owners or operators of such sites, abutters or other persons) and the off-site disposal of hazardous substances. We believe that we have been and are in substantial compliance with the terms of all applicable environmental laws and regulations and that we have no liabilities or obligations under environmental requirements that we would expect to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
