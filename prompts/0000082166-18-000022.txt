Product lines have been generally grouped in these segments based on technology, manufacturing processes, and end-use application; however, a business segment may serve more than one of the product markets identified above. The Company measures the profitability performance of its segments primarily based on their operating income excluding general and administrative expenses. Other expense and income taxes are not allocated to individual operating segments, and assets not identifiable to an individual segment are included as corporate assets. Segment information is reported consistent with the Company's management reporting structure.

Business segment financial information is found on the following pages of this Form 10-K:
23 | Results of Operations – Segment Analysis 
72 | Note 16 Business Segments and Major Customer Information

Applied Technology
Applied Technology designs, manufactures, sells, and services innovative precision agriculture products and information management tools that help growers reduce costs, more precisely control inputs, and improve farm yields.  The Applied Technology product families include field computers, application controls, GPS-guidance steering systems, automatic boom controls, injection systems, and planter and seeder controls. Applied Technology's services include high-speed in-field Internet connectivity and cloud-based data management. The Company's investment in the continued build-out of the Slingshot™ platform has also

positioned Applied Technology as an information platform that improves decision-making and achieves business efficiencies for its agriculture retail partners.
Applied Technology sells its precision agriculture control products to both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and through aftermarket distribution partners in the United States and in most major agricultural areas around the world. The Company's competitive advantage in this segment is designing and selling easy to use, reliable, and innovative value-added products that are supported by an industry-leading service and support team.
Engineered Films
Engineered Films produces high-performance plastic films and sheeting for geomembrane, agricultural, construction, and industrial applications. Engineered Films acquired the assets of Colorado Lining International, Inc. (CLI) in September 2017. This acquisition enhanced the division's geomembrane market position through extended service and product offerings with the addition of new design-build and installation service components. The acquisition of CLI advanced Engineered Films’ business model into a vertically-integrated, full-service solutions provider for the geomembrane market.
Engineered Films sells both direct to end-customers and through independent third-party distributors. The majority of product sold into the construction and agriculture markets is through distributors, while sales into the geomembrane and industrial markets are more direct in nature. The Company extrudes a significant portion of the film converted for its commercial products and believes it is one of the largest sheeting converters in the United States in the markets it serves. Engineered Films' ability to extrude and convert films, along with offering installation services for its geomembrane products, allows it to provide a more customized solution to customers. A number of film manufacturers compete with the Company on both price and product availability. Engineered Films is the Company's most capital-intensive business segment, and historically has made sizable investments in new extrusion capacity and conversion equipment. This segment's capital expenditures were $8.1 million in fiscal 2018, $2.8 million in fiscal 2017, and $10.8 million in fiscal 2016. 
Aerostar
Aerostar serves the aerospace/defense, radar and lighter-than-air markets. Aerostar's primary products include high-altitude (stratospheric or lighter-than-air) balloons, tethered aerostats, and radar systems. These products can be integrated with additional third-party sensors to provide research, communications, and situational awareness capabilities to governmental and commercial customers. Aerostar’s growth strategy emphasizes the design and manufacture of proprietary products in these markets. Aerostar also pursues product and support services contracts with agencies and instrumentalities of the U.S. government as well as sales of advanced radar systems and aerostats in international markets. In previous years, Aerostar also provided contract manufacturing services. The Company largely exited this business and the planned reduction of contract manufacturing activities was completed in fiscal 2016.

Aerostar sells to government agencies as both a prime contractor and subcontractor, and to commercial users primarily as a sub-contractor. Further, sales to government agencies often involve large contracts subject to frequent delays because of budget uncertainties, and protracted negotiation processes. The timing and size of contract wins can create volatility in Aerostar’s results.
OUTLOOK
The Company is very pleased with the performance achieved by all three operating divisions throughout fiscal 2018. All three divisions achieved double-digit sales growth and the Company believes it is well positioned for the year ahead. 
In fiscal 2018 Applied Technology achieved strong results in the face of challenging agricultural market conditions. The Company expects to continue to drive growth and will continue to strategically fund several long-term investments. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, the division launched a strategic initiative to grow its local presence in Brazil and drive organic growth in Latin America, in order to better capitalize on one of the largest agricultural markets in the world. 
Engineered Films demonstrated impressive operational discipline and sustained high plant utilization throughout fiscal 2018. The division grew sales by approximately $75 million year-over-year, and prior investments in acquisitions and manufacturing capacity drove strong growth in every market served. The division continues to see opportunities for growth and is investing in additional capacity in fiscal 2019. As for hurricane recovery efforts, the delivery of hurricane recovery film will result in sales of approximately $9 million in the first quarter and then return to significantly reduced levels consistent with prior years. 
During the year, Aerostar improved its financial performance and achieved more consistency and stability in its results. The division continues to sharpen its focus on the stratospheric balloon platform, and has divested of a few non-strategic portions of its business during and subsequent to the end of fiscal 2018. Strong performance on existing programs is driving confidence for continued growth with Aerostar’s stratospheric balloon platform.

Overall, the Company is well positioned as it enters fiscal 2019 because of the actions taken and investments made to preserve and strengthen our core business. Furthermore, the Company is evaluating strategic acquisitions and will continue to invest in additional manufacturing capacity and technology development to enhance its core product lines. The Company's goal remains to generate 10 percent annualized earnings growth over the long-term, excluding unusual and generally non-recurring items.
MAJOR CUSTOMER INFORMATION
No customers accounted for 10% or more of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2018, 2017, or 2016. 
SEASONAL WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
Some seasonal demand exists in both the Applied Technology and Engineered Films divisions, primarily due to their respective exposure to the agricultural market. However, given the overall diversification of the Company, the seasonal fluctuations in net working capital (accounts receivable, net plus inventories less accounts payable) are not usually significant.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The principal financial instruments that the Company maintains are cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and acquisition-related contingent payments. The Company manages the interest rate, credit, and market risks associated with these accounts through periodic reviews of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and establishment of appropriate allowances in accordance with Company policies. The Company does not use off-balance sheet financing, except to enter into operating leases.
The Company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency balance sheet risk. The use of these financial instruments has had no material effect on consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
RAW MATERIALS
The Company obtains a wide variety of materials from numerous vendors. Principal materials include electronic components for Applied Technology and Aerostar, various polymeric resins for Engineered Films, and fabrics and film for Aerostar. Engineered Films has experienced volatile resin prices over the past three years. Price increases could not always be passed on to customers due to weak demand and/or a competitive pricing environment. Predicting future material volatility and the related potential impact on the Company is not easily estimated and the Company is unable to do so to the degree required to build reliance on such forecasts.
PATENTS
The Company owns a number of patents. The Company does not believe that its business, as a whole, is materially dependent on any one patent or related group of patents. The Company focuses significant research and development effort to develop technology-based offerings. As such, the protection of the Company’s intellectual property is an important strategic objective. Along with an aggressive posture toward patenting new technology and protecting trade secrets, the Company has restrictions on the disclosure of our technology to industry and business partners to ensure that our intellectual property is maintained and protected.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The three business segments conduct ongoing research and development (R&D) efforts to improve their product offerings and develop new products. Most of the Company's R&D expenditures are directed toward new product development. R&D investment is particularly strong within the Applied Technology Division. Development of new technology and product enhancements within Applied Technology is a competitive differentiator and central to its long-term strategy. Engineered Films also utilizes R&D spending to develop new products and to value engineer and reformulate its products. These R&D investments deliver high-value film solutions to the markets it serves and also result in lower raw material costs and improved quality for existing product lines. Aerostar's investment in the development of new technology has a particular emphasis on its core stratospheric balloon platform. The Company's total R&D costs are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company believes that, in all material respects, it is in compliance with applicable federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Expenditures incurred in the past relating to compliance for operating facilities have not significantly affected the Company's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. The Company is unaware of any potential liabilities as of January 31, 2018 for any environmental matters that would have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
BACKLOG
As of February 1, 2018, the Company's order backlog totaled approximately $40.3 million. Backlog amounts as of February 1, 2017 and 2016 were $25.7 million and $18.6 million, respectively. Because the length of time between order and shipment varies considerably by business segment and customers can change delivery schedules or potentially cancel orders, the Company does not believe that backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period.
EMPLOYEES 
As of January 31, 2018, the Company had 1,157 employees (including temporary workers). Following is a summary of active employees by segment: Applied Technology - 394; Engineered Films - 471; Aerostar - 195; and Corporate Services - 97. Management believes its relationship with its employees is good.
