Our Company
Overview
We are a global biopharmaceutical company focused on saving lives, alleviating suffering and contributing to the economics of healthcare. We market Angiomax® (bivalirudin), Ionsys® (fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system), Minocin (minocycline) for injection, and Orbactiv® (oritavancin). We also have a pipeline of products in development, including Carbavance®, inclisiran (formerly known as PCSK9si) and MDCO-700 (formerly known as ABP-700). We have the right to develop, manufacture and commercialize inclisiran under our collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Alnylam. We believe that our products and products in development possess favorable attributes that competitive products do not provide, can satisfy unmet medical needs and offer, or, in the case of our products in development, have the potential to offer, improved performance to hospital businesses.
In addition to these products and products in development, we have a portfolio of ten generic drugs, which we refer to as our acute care generic products, that we have the non‑exclusive right to market in the United States. 
On November 3, 2015, we announced that we were in the process of evaluating our operations with a goal of unlocking stockholder value. In particular, we stated our current intention was to explore strategies for optimizing our capital structure and liquidity position and to narrow our operational focus by strategically separating non-core businesses and products in order to generate non-dilutive cash and reduce associated cash burn and capital requirements.
On February 1, 2016, we completed the sale of our hemostasis portfolio, consisting of PreveLeak, Raplixa and Recothrom, to wholly owned subsidiaries of Mallinckrodt plc, or Mallinckrodt. At the completion of the sale, we received approximately $174.1 million in cash, and may receive up to an additional $235.0 million in the aggregate following the achievement of certain specified calendar year net sales milestones with respect to net sales of PreveLeak and Raplixa. On June 21, 2016, we completed the sale of Cleviprex, Kengreal and rights to Argatroban for Injection, which we refer to collectively as Non-Core ACC Assets, to Chiesi USA, Inc., or Chiesi USA, and its parent company Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A., or Chiesi. At the completion of the sale, we received approximately $263.8 million in cash, which included the value of product inventory, and may receive up to an additional $480.0 million in the aggregate following the achievement of certain specified calendar year net sales milestones with respect to net sales of each of Cleviprex and Kengreal. In January 2017, we announced that we intend to seek opportunities to partner or divest Ionsys and are exploring the potential for separating our infectious disease business. 
In November 2016, we and Alnylam reported positive interim data from our ORION-1 phase 2 study for inclisiran with all patients completing 90 days follow up. In January 2017, we reported positive top-line results from the interim analysis with Day 180 follow-up for all 501 patients enrolled in the ORION-1 study, and we announced the initiation of our ORION-2 and ORION-3 studies. The results of the ORION-1 study are described in more detail in Part I, Item 1, Business - Research and Development Stage Products in Development - Inclisiran of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
The following table identifies each of our marketed and approved products and our products in development, their stage of development, their mechanism of action and the indications for which they have been approved for use or which they are intended to address. The table also identifies each of our acute care generic products and the therapeutic areas which they are intended to address. All of our products and products in development, except for Ionsys and inclisiran, are administered intravenously. Ionsys is administered transdermally and inclisiran is being developed as a subcutaneous injectable. All of our acute care generic products are injectable products.

Marketed Products 
Angiomax
Overview
Angiomax is an intravenous direct thrombin inhibitor that is a peptide compound. We licensed Angiomax from Biogen Idec, Inc., or Biogen Idec, in 1997 and have exclusive license rights to develop, market and sell Angiomax worldwide. Angiomax is approved in the United States for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing PTCA and for patients undergoing PCI, with provisional use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors, or GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, including patients with or at risk of HIT/HITTS.
We sell Angiomax in the United States under our name as a branded Angiomax product, and, on July 2, 2015, entered into a supply and distribution agreement with Sandoz Inc., or Sandoz, under which we granted Sandoz the exclusive right to sell in the United States an authorized generic of Angiomax (bivalirudin). We entered into the supply and distribution agreement as a result of the July 2, 2015 U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or Federal Circuit Court, ruling against us in our patent infringement litigation with Hospira, Inc., or Hospira, with respect to U.S. Patent No. 7,582,727, or the ‘727 patent, and U.S. Patent No. 7,598,343, or the ‘343 patent, covering a more consistent and improved Angiomax drug product and the processes by which it is made. In July 2015, subsequent to the Federal Circuit Court’s ruling against us in our patent infringement litigation with Hospira, Hospira’s abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, for its generic versions of Angiomax were approved by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and Hospira began selling its generic versions of Angiomax. Our patent infringement litigation involving the ‘727 patent and ‘343 patent, including our litigation with Hospira, are described in more detail in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Angiomax is now subject to generic competition. Due to the Federal Circuit Court’s July 2, 2015 decision and our resulting entry into a supply and distribution agreement with Sandoz and Hospira’s entry into the market, Angiomax is now subject to generic competition with the authorized generic and Hospira’s generic bivalirudin products. In addition, in our January 2012 settlement of our patent infringement litigation with APP Pharmaceuticals LLC, or APP, we entered into a license agreement with APP under which we granted it a non-exclusive license under the ‘727 patent and ‘343 patent to sell a generic bivalirudin for injection product under an APP ANDA in the United States beginning on May 1, 2019 and, in certain circumstances, on a date prior to May 1, 2019. The generic competition resulting from the Federal Circuit Court’s July 2, 2015 decision triggered APP’s right to sell its bivalirudin product upon approval of its ANDA. In November 2016, APP’s ANDA for its generic version of Angiomax was approved by the FDA and APP, through its affiliated company, Fresenius Kabi, commenced selling its generic version of Angiomax.
Angiomax is approved in the European Union for use as an anticoagulant in adult patients undergoing PCI, including patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI. The approval for ACS in Europe also includes treatment of adult patients with unstable angina or non-STEMI planned for urgent or early intervention, when used with aspirin and clopidogrel. In Europe, we market Angiomax under the tradename Angiox. In Europe, the principal patent covering Angiomax expired in August 2015. This patent covered the composition of matter of Angiomax. As a result, we do not have market exclusivity for Angiomax in Europe.
Angiomax is also approved for use in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Russia, India and a number of countries in Central America, South America and the Middle East for PCI indications similar to those approved by the FDA or European Medicines Agency, or EMA. In addition, Angiomax is approved in Canada for the treatment of patients with HIT/HITTS undergoing cardiac surgery. 
In 2016, our total net revenues related to branded Angiomax and authorized generic Angiomax (bivalirudin) were approximately $121.8 million. Net product revenues related to sales of Angiomax in 2016 totaled approximately $50.6 million, including 
 4

approximately $39.7 million of net product sales in the United States. Royalty revenues in 2016 related to the authorized generic sale of Angiomax (bivalirudin) by Sandoz totaled approximately $71.2 million.
Medical Need
Arterial thrombosis is a condition involving the formation of potentially occlusive blood clots in arteries and is associated with life-threatening conditions such as ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease and stroke. When arterial thrombosis occurs in the coronary arteries, depending on the severity of the occlusion, a range of ACS may result.
The spectrum of ACS, from unstable angina to acute myocardial infarction, or AMI, results in chest pain, other ischemic symptoms, and potential damage to the heart muscle. Unstable angina and similar conditions are caused most often by a rupture of atherosclerotic plaque on an arterial wall that results in clot formation and ultimately decreases coronary blood flow but does not cause complete blockage of the artery. AMI occurs when coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart, become completely blocked by a clot. AMI patients routinely undergo PCI as soon as possible as a primary treatment to unblock clogged arteries. Increasingly, patients with ACS are also undergoing early diagnostic angiography and receive PCI as soon as possible as treatment. 
Coronary angioplasty procedures such as PCI or PTCA that are used to restore arterial blood flow inherently increase the risk of clot formation. Clots form as the body reacts to the manipulation of the artery as a result of, for example, the use of catheters, stents, and other devices as well as from mechanical plaque rupture during the angioplasty procedure. Accordingly, anticoagulation therapy is routinely administered to patients undergoing angioplasty to limit both the underlying thrombotic process of ACS, as well as the clotting process stimulated by the procedure itself. 
Heparin has historically been used as an anticoagulant in the treatment of arterial thrombosis and during PCI or PTCA. However, heparin pharmacokinetics are non-linear, with intra- and interpatient variability. The result is that a patient’s response to the drug is less predictable and standardized dosing is difficult. In some patients, especially patients with ACS, higher doses of heparin and adjunct therapy, such as GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, may be required, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications. These shortcomings are significant because effective anticoagulation is important in patients being treated for ischemic heart disease to reduce the risk of further complications such as death, AMI or repeat revascularization. 
Additionally, heparin has been associated with an immune syndrome known as HIT/HITTS. The most severe form, while rare, is a potentially devastating condition with a very high risk of morbidity and mortality.
Clinical Development
We have invested significantly in the development of clinical data on the mode of action and clinical effects of Angiomax in procedures including coronary angioplasty and stenting. In our large clinical trials, Angiomax was compared to various drug regimens, including heparin and enoxaparin, a low-molecular weight heparin, which until relatively recently were the only injectable anticoagulants available for use in coronary angioplasty, and combinations of drugs including heparin or enoxaparin and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. In these trials, compared with the comparator drug regimens, Angiomax use resulted in similar rates of ischemic complications, such as myocardial infarction, or MI, and in fewer bleeding events, including a reduction in the need for blood transfusion. In addition, in these trials, the therapeutic effects of Angiomax were shown to be more predictable than the therapeutic effects of heparin.
Ionsys
Overview
Ionsys (fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system) is a compact, needle-free patient-controlled system for the short term management of acute postoperative pain for adults requiring opioid analgesia in the hospital. We obtained rights to Ionsys in January 2013 in connection with our acquisition of Incline Therapeutics, Inc., or Incline. In April 2015, we received FDA approval of our Supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, for Ionsys, and in November 2015, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Ionsys in the European Union. As with all opioids approved in the U.S., Ionsys is subject to a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program with the goal to mitigate the risks of respiratory depression resulting from accidental exposure to persons for whom it is not prescribed.
Medical Need
Current post-operative pain management regimens include opioid analgesics administered by patient-controlled pain management systems, known as intravenous patient controlled analgesia, or IV PCA, as well as by intermittent bolus administration (intravenously, intramuscular and oral). IV PCAs are controlled infusion pumps that deliver a prescribed amount of an opioid intravenously when a patient activates a button connected to the pump. IV PCA use has been associated with programming, medication, 
 5

and pump errors, IV line complications, limited patient mobility, and consumption of significant amounts of hospital resources while the use of intermittent opioid analgesics are associated with analgesic gaps. We believe that Ionsys provides on-demand analgesia, avoids the analgesic gaps, and eliminates the programming and other issues associated with IV PCA pumps. 
Clinical Development
Ionsys was originally developed and evaluated in an extensive clinical program, including seven Phase 3 clinical trials that were conducted prior to our acquisition of the product. Ionsys was approved by the FDA in the United States in 2006 but was never launched. Ionsys was approved by the EMA in Europe in 2006 and launched in Europe in 2008. However, due to device stability issues, Ionsys was voluntarily recalled later that year. The MAA was suspended and subsequently expired in 2011. In 2010, ALZA Corporation, or ALZA, licensed Ionsys to Incline and Incline developed an enhanced version of the system to address the device stability issues while further increasing reliability and improving usability. 
We completed both a pharmacokinetic study and usability study of Ionsys in the first quarter of 2013. The objective of the pharmacokinetic study was to demonstrate bioequivalence of fentanyl absorbed between the enhanced Ionsys system and the previously approved Ionsys system in healthy volunteers. The objective of the usability study was to assess ease of use with the enhanced Ionsys system in post-operative patients experienced by nurses, pharmacists and the patients themselves. Bioequivalence was successfully established between Ionsys and the previously approved Ionsys by statistical comparison of historical pharmacokinetics, or PK, data with in vivo-in vitro correlation re-established for Ionsys. The usability study successfully demonstrated ease of use for both patients and healthcare practitioners.
We have completed a trial evaluating Ionsys in 71 postoperative patients ages 12 to 17 years of age who had orthopedic or abdominal surgery. The PK, efficacy and safety results were similar to those observed in adults with no new safety signal evident. 
In 2016, our net sales of Ionsys totaled approximately $0.6 million.
Minocin IV
Overview
As a result of our acquisition of Rempex in December 2013, we acquired and began to market Minocin (minocycline) for injection, or Minocin IV, in the United States. Minocin IV is an intravenous formulation of a tetracycline-class antibiotic that is approved in the United States for the treatment of infections due to susceptible strains of designated gram-negative bacteria, including those due to Acinetobacter spp, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Shigella species, respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenza and respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocin IV is also approved for the treatment of infections caused by the following microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. In April 2015, we received FDA approval of our sNDA for our proprietary reformulation of Minocin IV utilizing magnesium sulfate that enables formulation and manufacturing of minocycline at a more physiologic pH and thus smaller fluid volumes. We ceased marketing the prior formulation of Minocin IV and commercially launched the new formulation in 2015. 
In 2016, our net sales of Minocin IV totaled approximately $8.7 million.
Medical Need
Acinetobacter has emerged as a significant problem in many U.S. hospitals where it can cause serious infections in critically ill patients, particularly in intensive care units. Inadequate treatment of Acinetobacter is associated with high mortality. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, recently classified multi-drug resistant, or MDR, Acinetobacter as a “serious” level antimicrobial drug resistance threat in the United States. “Serious” threats are classified by the CDC as threats that are not considered urgent but will worsen and may become urgent without ongoing public health monitoring and prevention activities. According to the CDC, about 63% of Acinetobacter species are considered MDR. Recent studies of a large hospital database presented at ID Week in 2014 showed that infections due to MDR Acinetobacter were associated with a greater cost and increased hospital length of stay compared to non-MDR isolates. Surveillance data show a significant majority of isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii are susceptible to minocycline in vitro. In studies of large collections of isolates from U.S. hospitals, as well as hospitals worldwide, presented at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy in September 2013 and ID Week in October 2013, minocycline was one of the most active agents in vitro against this pathogen, including MDR strains. In view of the high mortality and cost associated with infections caused by Acinetobacter species, we believe that Minocin IV would be a useful choice in patients infected with susceptible strains of Acinetobacter. 
Orbactiv
Overview
 6

Orbactiv is an intravenous antibiotic that is approved by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of adult patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, or ABSSSI, caused or suspected to be caused by susceptible isolates of designated gram-positive microorganisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, with a single dose treatment. The CDC has designated MRSA as a “serious” level antimicrobial drug resistance threat. Orbactiv is synthetically modified from a naturally occurring compound. In August 2014, we received FDA approval of our new drug application, or NDA, for Orbactiv, and in October 2014, we commercially launched Orbactiv in the United States. In March 2015, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Orbactiv in the European Union. 
We obtained rights to Orbactiv as a result of our acquisition of Targanta Therapeutics Corporation, or Targanta, in February 2009. We have exclusive rights to develop, market, and sell Orbactiv worldwide under a license agreement with Eli Lilly, which originally discovered and developed Orbactiv. In November 2013, the FDA designated Orbactiv a qualified infectious disease product, or QIDP, under the “Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now,” or GAIN, provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. In August 2014, following approval of Orbactiv, the FDA informed us that Orbactiv met the criteria for an additional five years of non-patent exclusivity in the United States to be added to the five year exclusivity period already provided by the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. As a result, the non-patent regulatory exclusivity for Orbactiv is scheduled to expire in August 2024.
In 2016, our net sales of Orbactiv totaled approximately $16.0 million. 
Medical Need
Although there are a number of other approved antibiotics for the treatment of ABSSSI, these antibiotics have important shortcomings, including:

• | bacteria are becoming non-susceptible or resistant to one or more of these existing antibiotics; 


• | some of these antibiotics, referred to as bacteriostatic drugs, inhibit the growth of pathogens and do not show bactericidal activity in vitro or in vivo. In contrast, bactericidal antibiotics, such as oritavancin, kill bacteria in vitro and in vivo in experimental models of infection;


• | oral antibiotic options can be associated with poor patient adherence to prescribed regimens, resulting in the need to seek retreatment in the emergency room and potentially hospital admission;


• | many of the antibiotics used to treat ABSSSI are difficult or inconvenient to administer, as they must be administered intravenously more than once, and in some cases once or twice daily for seven or more days, and may require the insertion of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line). As a result, patients receiving these antibiotics are typically either hospitalized or receive their antibiotics as an outpatient, either at an infusion center or at home, often once or twice a day; and 


• | therapeutic monitoring of plasma drug concentrations is commonly utilized when a frequently used intravenous antibiotic used for the treatment of ABSSSI due to MRSA is given to a patient.

We believe Orbactiv addresses many of the shortcomings of these antibiotics and provides an opportunity to ensure that a complete course of therapy for ABSSSIs is delivered as a single dose in various care settings. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of Orbactiv includes concentration-dependent killing and a long half-life, which allows for the single dose therapy. We believe this single dose regimen, is beneficial because it assists patient compliance, offers physicians the option to treat patients as either an outpatient or inpatient, and does not require additional patient visits for repeat intravenous infusions. 
Clinical Development
In the fourth quarter of 2010, we commenced two independent, pivotal Phase 3 trials of Orbactiv, SOLO I and SOLO II, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single 1200 mg intravenous dose of Orbactiv compared to multiple doses of intravenous vancomycin, for the treatment of ABSSSI, including infections caused by MRSA. We designed these large, identically designed, global, randomized, double-blind studies in accordance with guidance from the FDA and the EMA to ensure accurate representation of the population requiring treatment with an antibacterial agent for ABSSSIs, including ABSSSIs caused by MRSA. The protocols were agreed to with the FDA following a special protocol assessment, or SPA, and with the EMA through Final Scientific Advice process. 
SOLO. In the SOLO I and SOLO II clinical trials, we compared a single 1,200 mg intravenous dose of Orbactiv with seven to 10 days of intravenous vancomycin treatment given twice daily. The trials were designed to demonstrate that oritavancin was non-
 7

inferior to vancomycin using a primary efficacy endpoint that is a composite of resolution of fever and cessation of spread of visible infection without the use of rescue antibiotics at 48 to 72 hours following initiation of treatment. We enrolled 968 patients in the SOLO I clinical trial, and we enrolled 1,019 patients in the SOLO II clinical trial. 
In both trials, non-inferiority to vancomycin was demonstrated for all protocol-specified primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, specifically for the Early Clinical Evaluation (48-72 hours after treatment initiation) endpoint required by the FDA and the Post Therapy Evaluation (7-14 days after end of treatment) endpoint required by the EMA. The most frequently reported adverse events associated with Orbactiv were nausea, headache, vomiting and diarrhea. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of antibacterial agents including Orbactiv.
QT Studies. In the first quarter of 2013, we conducted a randomized, positive-, placebo-controlled thorough QTc study where 135 healthy subjects were administered a single 1600 mg dose of Orbactiv, placebo, and a positive control (moxifloxacin) by IV infusion over 3 hours. At a single 1600 mg dose of oritavancin, no significant effect on QTc interval was detected at peak plasma concentration or at any other time. We announced data from the trial in the second half of 2014. 
Additional development. We are exploring the development of Orbactiv for other potential indications or uses, including ABSSSI in children, uncomplicated bacteremia and other gram-positive bacterial infections.
Acute Care Generic Products
On January 22, 2012, we entered into a license and supply agreement with APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC, or APP, in connection with the settlement of our patent litigations with APP. Under the license and supply agreement, APP granted to us a non-exclusive license under APP’s marketing authorizations and intellectual property to sell ten generic products to hospitals and integrated delivery networks in the United States. The generic products are adenosine, amiodarone, azithromycin, clindamycin, esmolol, haloperidol, ondansetron, midazolam, milrinone and rocuronium. These acute care generic products are used in the therapeutic areas in which we focus or plan to focus, including acute cardiovascular, surgery and perioperative care and serious infectious diseases, and we believe complement our marketed products and product candidates. We began selling three of our acute care generic products, midazolam, ondansetron and rocuronium, in the first quarter of 2013. 
Research and Development Stage Products in Development
Carbavance
Overview
Carbavance is an antibiotic agent that we acquired in connection with our acquisition of Rempex and are developing for the treatment of hospitalized patients with serious gram-negative bacterial infections, including complicated urinary tract infections, hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, and bacteremia. Carbavance is a combination of vaborbactam, a proprietary, novel beta-lactamase inhibitor, with meropenem, a well-known and marketed carbapenem antibiotic. Carbavance is focused on addressing one of the three “urgent” level antimicrobial resistance threats identified by the CDC -- carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE. “Urgent” threats are classified by the CDC as having the potential to become widespread and require urgent public health attention to identify infections and limit transmissions. The FDA designated Carbavance a QIDP under the GAIN provisions of the FDASIA. The QIDP designation provides Carbavance priority review by the FDA, eligibility for the FDA’s “fast track” status, and an additional five years of exclusivity upon approval of the product. Carbavance is being developed under a cost-sharing arrangement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under which we and our subsidiary, Rempex Pharmaceuticals Inc., have the potential to receive additional funding to support the development of Carbavance, as further detailed in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We submitted an NDA to the FDA in the United States and that NDA was accepted for filing with a priority review classification on February 28, 2017. The FDA indicated that it does not currently plan to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application. We intend to submit a marketing authorization application in the European Union.
Medical Need
Enterobacteriaceae are the largest group of gram-negative pathogens associated with healthcare-associated infections. Examples of bacterial pathogens that are members of the Enterobacteriaceae family are E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae. The CDC reports that approximately 140,000 Enterobacteriaceae infections occur annually. These infections are often treated with a variety of antimicrobial agents, including aminoglycoside, cephalosporin and penicillin derivatives, and the carbapenem class of antibiotics. Over time, Enterobacteriaceae have developed resistance to these antibiotics. One important mechanism that results in resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics is bacterial acquisition of resistance genes that code for production of enzymes that 
 8

degrade this class of drugs, called beta lactamases. Over the last decade, clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae have acquired beta-lactamases that degrade all of the members of the beta-lactam class, including the carbapenem class of antibiotics. As a result, CRE infections are increasing among hospitalized patients and have become resistant to all or nearly all antibiotics available today. CRE was designated by the CDC as an urgent antimicrobial resistance threat and was the only pathogen designated at this highest resistant threat level that causes systemic infections in hospitalized patients.
Beta lactamase inhibitors, or BLIs, have been developed to overcome, and are a proven approach to overcoming, beta lactamase-mediated resistance. With the rapid rise of beta lactamases resistant to carbapenems, or carbapenemases, a new generation of BLIs is needed because older agents have no important inhibitory activity against carbapenemases. We discovered a new class of cyclic boronic acid inhibitors, with the first novel member of this class being vaborbactam. Vaborbactam was optimized to be combined with meropenem to create our fixed combination product candidate, Carbavance. Meropenem is a carbapenem that is FDA-approved for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated skin and skin structure infections in adults and pediatric patients, and for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in the U.S. as well as for other indications including urinary tract infections in the European Union. It has been marketed in the U.S. and worldwide for nearly two decades. Meropenem is considered one of the first line agents for the treatment of hospital-acquired infections, including those in the urinary and respiratory tracts, intraabdominal infections, skin and skin-structure infections, and bacteremia. Vaborbactam has broad inhibitory activity against beta-lactamases, but was specifically designed to inhibit serine carbapenemases such as the Klebsiella pneumonia carbapenemase, or KPC, and to be combined with a carbapenem antimicrobial.
We are developing Carbavance for the treatment of serious gram-negative infections in hospitalized patients, particularly in the setting of documented or suspected infections due to KPC-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in patients where limited or no alternative therapies are available. 
Clinical Development
Phase 1 Studies. In December 2013, Rempex completed Phase 1 dose-escalation studies of vaborbactam alone or in combination with meropenem in healthy subjects. In these studies, safety was observed with our beta-lactamase inhibitor, vaborbactam, alone and in combination with a meropenem at expected therapeutic doses. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of our beta-lactamase inhibitor was similar to most carbapenem antibiotics, and there was no evidence of drug-drug interaction between our beta-lactamase inhibitor and meropenem. Additional Phase I studies demonstrated high penetration of meropenem and vaborbactam in lung tissues (to support studies in pulmonary infection), and good safety and pharmacokinetic properties in patients with renal impairment to support use in critically ill patients.
TANGO 1. In June 2016, we announced positive results from the Phase 3 TANGO 1 clinical trial of Carbavance. TANGO 1 was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Carbavance compared to piperacillin-tazobactam in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, or cUTIs, including acute pyelonephritis, in adults. The trial enrolled 550 adult patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive Carbavance (meropenem 2g-vaborbactam 2g) as a three-hour intravenous infusion every eight hours or piperacillin 4g-tazobactam 500mg as a 30-minute intravenous infusion every eight hours, each for up to 10 days. After a minimum of five days of intravenous therapy, patients who met protocol-defined criteria of improvement were transitioned to oral levofloxacin. 
Carbavance met both FDA and EMA pre-specified primary endpoints in patients with cUTIs. Carbavance also demonstrated statistical superiority over piperacillin-tazobactam, with overall success in 98.4% of patients treated with Carbavance, using the FDA primary endpoint. Carbavance was well tolerated in the trial. 
TANGO 2. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we initiated TANGO 2, a multi‑center, randomized, open‑label Phase 3 clinical trial of Carbavance versus “best available therapy” in patients with selected serious infections due to CRE. Patients were randomized on a 2:1 basis to receive either Carbavance or the “best available therapy” for up to 14 days. Best available therapy will be selected from among antimicrobial agents that may have little to no activity against the CRE pathogens, but are often used as therapy in patients with serious infections and desperate needs. This clinical trial is enrolling patients with cUTIs, nosocomial pneumonia and/or bacteremia. 
Inclisiran 
Overview
Inclisiran is a subcutaneously administered PCSK9 synthesis inhibitor which works through RNA interference, or RNAi, and is being developed for the potential treatment of hypercholesterolemia. We obtained rights to this product candidate under a license and collaboration agreement that we entered into with Alnylam in February 2013 to develop, manufacture and commercialize RNAi therapeutics targeting the PCSK9 gene for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and other human diseases. RNAi is a naturally occurring biological pathway within cells for selectively silencing and regulating the translation of specific mRNAs. PCSK9 is a gene involved in the regulation of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, receptor levels on hepatocytes and the metabolism of LDL 
 9

cholesterol, or LDL-C, which is commonly referred to as “bad” cholesterol. Inclisiran is designed to inhibit the synthesis of PCSK9 and lead to reduced levels of LDL-C.
Medical Need
Despite the widespread use of statins, a large number of cardiovascular events still occur. Many of these events occur due to increased lipid related risk, predominantly driven by elevated LDL-C levels. Many patients, including those with familial dyslipidemias, do not achieve adequate LDL-C levels at maximum tolerated doses of lipid-lowering therapies such as statins. Other patients are intolerant of any dose of statins or other lipid-lowering therapies. We believe that, in these scenarios, new effective treatments to significantly lower LDL-C are needed. Clinical studies performed with monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9, with or without statins, as well as preclinical studies in non-human primates and a Phase 1 study with inclisiran conducted by Alnylam have shown that therapies that act on PCSK9 lower LDL-C by as much as 50%, and therefore have the potential to meet this unmet need for additional significant LDL-C reduction.
Clinical Development
Under our license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam, we and Alnylam initially collaborated on the development of inclisiran and ALN-PCS02, an intravenously administered RNAi therapeutic. Alnylam was responsible for the development of these product candidates until Phase 1 was completed. We have assumed all other responsibility for the development and commercialization of all product candidates under our agreement with Alnylam. In October 2013, we and Alnylam selected a lead development candidate, now referred to as inclisiran, for development for the potential treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In December 2014, under the terms of our agreement with Alnylam, Alnylam initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of inclisiran in the United Kingdom. Data from the Phase 1 trial was presented at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in August 2015 and at the American Heart Association meeting in November 2015, and was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
In January 2016, we began enrolling patients in the ORION-1 Phase 2 dose finding trial. ORION-1 is being conducted as a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial of single or multiple subcutaneous injections of inclisiran in a total of 501 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), or ASCVD-risk equivalents (e.g., diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia), and elevated LDL-C despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C lowering therapies. The study compares the effect of different doses of inclisiran and evaluates the potential for an infrequent dosing regimen. The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline at Day 180. 
In November 2016, we and Alnylam reported positive interim data from ORION-1 with all patients completing 90 days follow up. Inclisiran was generally well tolerated and no material safety issue was observed, including no elevations of liver enzymes considered related to study medication and no neuropathy or change in renal function. Overall incidence of treatment emergent adverse events was 54% both in patients randomized to placebo and in patients randomized to inclisiran, with no differences between inclisiran doses. Injection site reactions (ISRs) with inclisiran were infrequent (observed in 3.2% of patients), mild or moderate, and transient - in only 2.4% of patients, the reported ISR started or was still present 4 or more hours after dosing. Baseline LDL-C was approximately 130 mg/dL among 497 randomized and treated patients. Patients dosed with one 300 mg subcutaneous injection of inclisiran achieved mean LDL-C reductions of 51% at Day 60, which were durable to Day 90 (mean 45% and up to 76%). All differences relative to placebo in these 497 patients were statistically significant (p <0.0001). Among 189 randomized and treated patients who had been followed for 180 days or more by the interim data cut-off date of October 25, 2016, one 300 mg subcutaneous injection of inclisiran achieved mean LDL-C reductions of 59% at Day 60, which were durable to Day 90 (mean 50%) and Day 180 (mean 43% and up to 81%). Two 300 mg injections of inclisiran - one given on Day 1 and one on Day 90 - achieved a mean LDL-C reduction of 57% at Day 120, which was durable to Day 180 (mean 52% and up to 81%). All differences relative to placebo in these 189 patients were statistically significant (p <0.0001).
In January 2017, we reported positive top-line results from the interim analysis with Day 180 follow-up for all 501 patients enrolled in the ongoing ORION-1 Phase 2 study. In the interim analysis, inclisiran continued to demonstrate significant and durable LDL-C reduction, reaffirming the potential for a highly-differentiated, low-volume dosing regimen of two or three injections per year. Inclisiran was well tolerated and no material safety issue, including no investigational drug-related elevation of liver enzymes, neuropathy or change in renal function, was observed. Injection site reactions with inclisiran were infrequent, mild or moderate, and transient. 
In January 2017, we initiated the ORION-2 and ORION-3 studies. ORION-2 will examine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of inclisiran in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The ORION-3 study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of long-term dosing of inclisiran and will also measure the effects of treatment, including a comparison of the effects of inclisiran and evolocumab, as well as switching from evolocumab to inclisiran, on certain clinical and patient-reported endpoints.
MDCO-700
Overview
 10

MDCO-700 is an intravenous anesthetic agent being developed for moderate or deep sedation and general anesthesia in patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. We acquired MDCO-700 in connection with our acquisition of Annovation BioPharma, Inc. in February 2015. MDCO-700 is a positive allosteric modulator of the ã-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) ligand-gated ion channel. The endogenous ligand for this channel is GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. MDCO-700 has an ester bond that undergoes rapid cleavage via non-specific tissue esterases producing an inactive carboxylic acid metabolite. This chemical feature is intended to provide for both rapid onset of anesthesia as well as a more rapid and more consistent emergence than presently available intravenous agents.
Medical Need
Over the past decade, the number of surgical procedures performed has steadily increased and the proportion of those performed on an outpatient basis now exceeds 70% in most parts of the United States. At the same time, surgical care and procedural medicine have moved towards lighter anesthesia, minimal and focused procedural sedation, and teams that include many non-physician care providers. These dynamics are expanding most rapidly in the older population who are generally at higher risk due to a greater number of medical co-morbidities. In the European Union where the patient demographic is similar, there is pressure to provide high quality surgical care services with shorter stays to address the increasing costs and increasing demand for surgical care. In light of these trends, we believe that new agents need to be developed that are capable of producing highly specific depth of sedation or anesthesia yet also be highly reversible. We are developing MDCO-700 to meet the need for more effective drugs with a higher therapeutic index that exhibit a predictable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics, or PK/PD, relationship and allow precisely tailored control of sedation and anesthesia.
Clinical Development
Prior to our acquisition of Annovation in February 2015, Annovation advanced MDCO-700 into Phase 1 human testing and completed a first-in-human, single bolus escalation Phase 1 study (ANVN-01). Following our acquisition, we completed a 30-minute infusion escalation Phase 1 study (ANVN-02) in 2015. We have subsequently conducted three additional Phase 1 studies: ANVN-03, a bolus dose optimization study, ANVN-04, an infusion dose optimization study of doses intended to induce light-moderate and deep sedation and ANVN-05, a study examining infusion dose regimens of MDCO-700 intended for the induction of general anesthesia. These studies have evaluated the drug’s safety and tolerability, PK and PD, with an objective to identify dose ranges useful for both sedation and general anesthesia. The entire Phase 1 program has been conducted in the Netherlands. We have initiated a Phase 2 dose-finding procedural sedation study, which is currently enrolling patients in the Netherlands, in patients undergoing elective colonoscopy for screening or diagnostic purposes. 
Sales and Distribution
We market and sell Ionsys, Minocin IV and Orbactiv in the United States with salesforces experienced in selling to hospital customers. As of December 31, 2016, our combined salesforce in the United States consisted of approximately 120 representatives, whom we generally refer to as engagement partners and customer solutions managers. In support of our sales efforts, we focus or expect to focus: 

• | our Ionsys sales efforts on hospital systems, individual hospitals, and health care providers, including anesthesiologists, surgeons, nurses and pharmacists;


• | our Minocin IV sales efforts on hospital systems and individual hospitals, including infectious disease, emergency medicine and critical care physicians, microbiologists and pharmacists; and


• | our Orbactiv sales efforts in the United States on hospital systems, individual hospitals, hospital and physician owned infusion centers and health care providers, including infectious disease and emergency room physicians, hospitalists, infectious disease pharmacists, case managers and microbiologists.

We no longer focus sales efforts on branded Angiomax in the United States. Given the generic competition, we determined to suspend our efforts and expenditures with respect to branded Angiomax other than for supply chain, quality, safety monitoring and limited clinical activities and other necessary activities.
We believe our ability to deliver relevant, advanced and reliable service and information to our concentrated customer base provides us with significant market advantage in the United States, and will provide us with such advantage outside the United States, even in highly competitive sub-segments of the hospital market such as cardiology. 
We distribute our branded Angiomax product, Minocin IV, Orbactiv and the acute care generic products we market in the United States through a sole source distribution model with Integrated Commercialization Solutions, or ICS. Under this model, we currently 
 11

sell our branded Angiomax product, Minocin IV, Orbactiv and our acute care generic products to our sole source distributor, ICS. ICS then sells these products to a limited number of national medical and pharmaceutical wholesalers with distribution centers located throughout the United States and, in certain cases, directly to hospitals and infusion centers. We distribute Ionsys through a similar sole source distribution model with Cardinal Health.
Our agreement with ICS, which we initially entered into in February 2007 and have subsequently amended from time to time, provides that ICS will be our exclusive distributor of our branded Angiomax product, Minocin IV, Orbactiv, and the acute care generic products we market in the United States. Under the terms of this fee-for-service agreement, ICS places orders with us for sufficient quantities of these products to maintain an appropriate level of inventory based on our wholesalers’ historical purchase volumes. ICS assumes all credit and inventory risks, is subject to our standard return policy and has sole responsibility for determining the prices at which it sells the products, subject to specified limitations in the agreement. The agreement terminates on February 28, 2019 and will automatically renew for additional one-year periods unless either party gives notice at least 90 days prior to the automatic extension. Either party may terminate the agreement at any time and for any reason upon 180 days prior written notice to the other party. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement upon an uncured default of a material obligation by the other party and other specified conditions. ICS’s payment terms under our distribution agreement with them are 45 days, which can be further extended to 49 days if ICS pays by wire transfer. 
On July 2, 2015, we entered into a supply and distribution agreement with Sandoz under which we granted Sandoz the exclusive right to sell in the United States bivalirudin (250 mg/ml) under our approved new drug application for Angiomax but labeled and sold under the Sandoz name. We refer to this product herein as authorized generic Angiomax (bivalirudin). Under the agreement, we agreed to supply Sandoz and Sandoz agreed to purchase exclusively from us authorized generic Angiomax (bivalirudin). Sandoz has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to market, distribute and sell authorized generic Angiomax (bivalirudin) in the United States during the term of the agreement. Sandoz has agreed to pay us a price per vial equal to our cost of goods, and Sandoz will pay us on a quarterly basis a high double digit percentage of its net profits (net sales less our cost of goods and certain agreed expenses of Sandoz) on sales of authorized generic Angiomax (bivalirudin). The term of the agreement will continue until July 2, 2020 and will automatically renew for successive one-year periods thereafter unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least six months prior to the end of the applicable term. Either party may terminate the agreement at any time if the other party is in material breach of the agreement and does not cure such breach within 60 days, the other party undergoes bankruptcy events, the other party is unable to perform its obligations under the agreement for more than 120 consecutive days due to a force majeure event, compliance with the agreement would violate law or net profits related to sales of the authorized generic Angiomax in any month fall below a low double digit percentage of net sales of the authorized generic Angiomax in such month. We may also terminate the agreement at any time that no other pharmaceutical product containing bivalirudin in a lyophilized form as its sole active ingredient is being sold in the United States.
We also market and sell Angiomax and Ionsys outside the United States, principally through distributor relationships. These distributors include Sandoz Canada Inc., which distributes Angiomax in Canada, and affiliates of Grupo Ferrer Internacional who distribute Angiox in Cyprus, Greece, Portugal and Spain and in a number of countries in Central America and South America. We also have agreements with other third parties for other countries outside of the United States, including Israel, Slovenia, Hong Kong and certain countries in the Middle East. We have entered into a strategic collaboration with SciClone Pharmaceuticals, or SciClone, under which we granted SciClone a license and the exclusive rights to promote, market and sell Angiomax in China. We have also entered into an agreement with SymBio Pharmaceuticals Ltd., or Symbio, pursuant to which we granted Symbio an exclusive license in Japan to develop and commercialize Ionsys.
We continue to consider potential global and regional collaboration opportunities for certain of our products and products in development. We believe that partnering with third parties has the potential to improve the performance of our marketed products and provide a viable platform to commercialize our products and products in development that are not yet approved, if and when they are approved and ready to be marketed.
Manufacturing
We do not have a manufacturing infrastructure and we do not intend to develop one. We are a party to agreements with contract manufacturers for the supply of bulk drug substance for our products and with other third parties for the formulation, packaging and distribution of our products. Our product manufacturing operation is comprised of professionals with expertise in pharmaceutical manufacturing, product development, logistics and supply chain management and quality management and supply chain compliance. These professionals oversee the manufacturing and distribution of our products by third-party companies. 
Angiomax
Bulk Drug Substance. In December 1999, we entered into a commercial development and supply agreement with Lonza Braine, S.A., or Lonza Braine, which was formerly known as UCB Bioproducts S.A., for the development and supply of Angiomax bulk drug substance. Together with Lonza Braine, we developed a second generation chemical synthesis process to improve the economics 
 12

of manufacturing Angiomax bulk drug substance. This process, which was approved by the FDA in May 2003 and is used in the manufacture of Angiomax bulk drug substance today, is known as the Chemilog process. We have agreed that, during the term of the agreement, we will purchase a substantial portion of our Angiomax bulk drug substance manufactured using the Chemilog process from Lonza Braine at agreed upon prices. Following the expiration of the agreement or if we terminate the agreement prior to its expiration, Lonza Braine has agreed to transfer the development technology to us. If we engage a third party to manufacture Angiomax for us using the Chemilog process prior to bivalirudin becoming a generic drug in the United States, we will be obligated to pay Lonza Braine a royalty based on the amount paid by us to the third-party manufacturer. In June 2015, we amended the agreement with Lonza providing for the transition of the manufacture of Angiomax bulk drug substance from the Chemilog process to a solid phase peptide synthesis process. The amendment extends the expiration date of the agreement to December 31, 2019, subject to automatic renewals of consecutive three-year periods unless either party provides notice of non-renewal within eighteen months prior to the expiration of the initial term or any renewal term. We may only terminate the agreement prior to its expiration in the event of a material breach by Lonza Braine, if such breach is not cured within 30 days. In December 2016, Lonza Braine agreed to sell its peptide business, including the production and supply of Angiomax bulk drug substance, to Polypeptide Laboratories Holding AB.
In September 2011, we entered into a supply agreement with Teva API, Inc., or Teva API, under which we agreed to purchase from Teva API certain minimum quantities of Angiomax bulk drug substance for our commercial supply at agreed upon specified prices.  The supply agreement had an initial expiration date of December 31, 2015, subject to automatic renewals for up to two successive three-year periods unless terminated by us with at least six-months’ written notice or by Teva API with at least 24-months written notice prior to the expiration of the initial term or either renewal term.  Under an amendment to the supply agreement entered into in July 2015, we and Teva API agreed to extend the agreement until December 31, 2016, at which time the agreement will terminate unless extended by the parties. We and Teva have not agreed to extend the term of this agreement; however, there remain certain ongoing production commitments under the agreement.
Drug Product. In March 2011, we entered into a master agreement with Patheon International A.G., or Patheon International, for the manufacture of Angiomax drug product. Pursuant to the agreement, as amended, Patheon International conducts the fill-finish of Angiomax drug product for our commercial sale supply in accordance with binding commitments in a forecast provided by us. Our agreement with Patheon International expires in December 2018, subject to automatic renewals for successive terms of two years each unless either party gives written notice to the other party of its intention to terminate the agreement at least 18 months prior to the end of the then current term. Either party may terminate the agreement for material breach by the other party, if the material breach is not cured within 60 days after written notice, unless the breach by its nature is not curable. In such case, the non-breaching party has the right to terminate the agreement immediately upon providing written notice as long as the written notice is provided within 30 days of the terminating party receiving notice of the breach. We have the right to terminate the agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice in the event that any governmental agency takes any action, or raises any objection, that prevents us from importing, exporting, purchasing or selling Angiomax. 
In January 2012, we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with APP. Under the contract manufacturing agreement, as amended, we agreed to purchase from APP a specified minimum percentage of our requirements for Angiomax finished product for the sale of the Angiomax product in the United States. We agreed to pay APP a fixed price per vial supplied and to reimburse APP for specified development costs and capital expenditures made by APP. The term of the contract manufacturing agreement ends on April 30, 2021, but may be extended, at our sole option, for an additional term of two years. If a generic form of bivalirudin for injection is marketed by APP or another third party during the term of the contract manufacturing agreement, we have the right to renegotiate the price and minimum quantity terms of the contract manufacturing agreement and, if such terms cannot be agreed to by the parties, we will have the right to terminate the contract manufacturing agreement upon 90 days prior written notice. Either party may terminate the contract manufacturing agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party, effective immediately in the case of a non-curable breach and effective upon 60 days prior written notice in the case of a curable breach if such breach is not cured within such 60-day period. Either party may also terminate the contract manufacturing agreement if the other party undergoes bankruptcy events. We may terminate the contract manufacturing agreement upon at least 12 months’ prior written notice if we decide to discontinue marketing the Angiomax product in the United States or upon 30 days’ prior written notice in the event that any government or regulatory authority prevents us from purchasing or selling the Angiomax product in the United States. 
Minocin IV
Bulk Drug Substance. Prior to our acquisition of Rempex, in January 2013 Rempex entered into a master services agreement with IDT Australia Limited for the manufacture of minocycline hydrochloride parenteral active pharmaceutical ingredient, to be used for the supply of Minocin IV. The agreement expires in January 2020 unless earlier terminated by us, for any reason, with 30 days’ notice, or by either party due to a material breach of the agreement after 30 days’ notice if such breach is not cured within such 30-day period.
 13

Drug Product. In January 2017, we entered into a manufacturing services agreement with Patheon UK Limited, or Patheon UK. Under the terms of the agreement, Patheon UK provides fill-finish activities of Minocin IV drug product for commercial sale supply in accordance with a forecast provided by us. Our agreement with Patheon UK expires in December 2025, subject to automatic renewals for successive two year periods unless terminated by either party at least eighteen months prior to the end of the then current term. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a breach by the other party, effective immediately in the case of a non-curable breach and effective upon 45 days prior written notice in the case of a curable breach if such breach is not cured within 90 days of the first written notice. Either party may also terminate the agreement if the other party undergoes bankruptcy or insolvency events. We may terminate the agreement upon 30 days prior written notice if a regulatory authority takes action that prevents us from importing, exporting, purchasing or selling the product which arises from Patheon UK’s acts or omissions. We may also terminate the agreement if we decide to discontinue marketing the product. After the start of commercial manufacturing, either party may terminate the agreement without cause upon 24 months prior written notice. 
Orbactiv
Bulk Drug Substance. Prior to our acquisition of Orbactiv, in December 2001, Targanta entered into a development and supply agreement with Abbott Laboratories, or Abbott, for the supply of Orbactiv bulk drug substance for clinical use in clinical trials. In January 2013, Abbott separated into two independent companies, Abbott and AbbVie Inc., or AbbVie. As a result of the separation, in August 2013 we entered into a new development and supply agreement regarding Orbactiv with AbbVie. Under the terms of the AbbVie agreement we are required to purchase Orbactiv bulk drug substance exclusively from AbbVie, unless AbbVie fails to deliver sufficient Orbactiv bulk drug substance to meet our needs. In such event, we may use another manufacturer to supply Orbactiv bulk drug substance for as long as AbbVie is unable to supply sufficient Orbactiv bulk drug substance. We are also required to provide a 24 month rolling forecast which includes a firm order period. The agreement expires six contract years from the date of the first sale of Orbactiv in the territory a product launch date, subject to automatic three-year renewal periods unless we give notice in writing to AbbVie 30 months prior to the end of any term of our intention not to renew the agreement. Additionally, AbbVie may terminate the agreement by notifying us in writing three years prior to the end of any term, of its intention to not renew the agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement for breach by the other party, if the breach is not cured within 60 days after receipt of written notice or for breaches of a type that cannot be remedied within 60 days, if a remedy is not promptly commenced and diligently pursued until complete remediation. Upon termination, AbbVie is required to return to us all unused raw materials associated with the bulk drug substance that has been paid for by us, cell banks, cell cultures, samples, viruses, genetic materials, data and any other property or other information furnished by us or acquired by AbbVie at our cost with respect to the commercial supply of bulk drug substance or Orbactiv under the agreement.
Drug Product. In October 2011, we entered into an agreement with Patheon UK for the commercial scale up and validation of our commercial manufacturing process. In October 2013, we entered into a master services agreement with Patheon UK for the manufacture of Orbactiv. Pursuant to the agreement, Patheon UK conducts the fill-finish of Orbactiv for our commercial sale supply in accordance with a forecast provided by us. Our agreement with Patheon UK expires in December 2019, and is subject to automatic renewals for successive terms of two years each unless either party gives written notice to the other Party of its intention to terminate the agreement at least 18 months prior to the end of the then current term. 
Acute Care Generic Products
APP, a division of Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC, has agreed to supply and we have agreed to purchase from APP, our entire requirement for the acute care generic products under the license and supply agreement we entered into with APP in January 2012. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required pay APP’s cost of goods for the supply of the acute care generic products on an ongoing basis. The term of the license and supply agreement ends January 22, 2022. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party, unless the material breach is cured within 90 days of written notice or within 120 days of written notice if the breach is incapable of being cured within the 90-day period. APP may terminate the agreement upon 60 days prior written notice if we fail to pay in full any invoice that is past due unless such payment is the subject of a dispute set forth in writing by us. We may terminate the agreement if, with respect to two purchase orders in a calendar year, APP has failed to supply at least the aggregate quantity of conforming product specified in the purchase order or failed to deliver the product prior to the applicable delivery date specified in the purchase order and APP has failed to cure these breaches in the manner specified in the agreement. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement on a product-by-product basis, effective immediately, upon written notice to the other party in the event the FDA takes any action the result of which is to permanently prohibit the manufacture of the product in the United States. APP may also terminate the agreement on a product-by-product basis upon 180 days prior written notice if APP has determined that it will discontinue the marketing authorization for the product in the United States. We may terminate the agreement on a product-by-product basis upon 180 days prior written notice if the total market value of a product falls below a specified percentage of the total market value of the product as of the effective date of the agreement. In the event that the agreement is terminated with respect to a product, the parties shall agree upon a substitute product.
Ionsys
 14

Bulk Drug Substance. Prior to our acquisition of Incline, Incline entered into an agreement with Johnson Matthey for the supply of fentanyl hydrochloride, the drug delivered by the Ionsys system, for development, clinical and initial commercial production. At the appropriate time, we expect to enter into a long term commercial supply agreement for fentanyl hydrochloride with Johnson Matthey.
Drug Unit Manufacturing.  We have entered into a manufacturing agreement with Renaissance Lakewood, LLC, or Renaissance, for the manufacture of the Ionsys drug unit. Under the terms of the agreement, Renaissance will provide product for commercial sale in accordance with minimum purchase commitments and a forecast provided by us. Our agreement with Renaissance expires in December 2021, subject to automatic renewals for successive two year periods unless terminated by either party at least two years prior to the end of the then current term. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a breach by the other party if such breach is not cured within 60 days of the written notice, or if the other party undergoes bankruptcy or insolvency events. We may terminate the agreement upon 30 days prior written notice if Renaissance is unable to supply certain quantities of product or if we decide to discontinue commercialization of the product or a governmental agency or court takes action or raises an objection that prevents the purchase, sale or manufacture of the product. 
Controller Manufacturing. The electronic component of the Ionsys system, referred to as the controller, is manufactured by Sanmina Corporation, or Sanmina. In January 2011, Incline entered into an agreement with Sanmina for manufacturing process development and supply of controllers for development, clinical trial and design verification testing use. In September 2013, we entered into a supply agreement with Sanmina for commercial supply of the controller for the Ionsys system.
The controller uses an application specific integrated circuit, or ASIC, manufactured by On Semiconductor. In November 2010, Incline entered into an agreement with On Semiconductor for the development and qualification of the ASIC, and supply of components for development, clinical trial and design verification testing.
MDCO-700
Bulk Drug Substance. With our acquisition of Annovation in February 2015, we received sufficient bulk drug substance for our immediate development needs. Subsequently, we entered into a letter of intent with CordenPharma (Synkem S.A.S.) for the manufacture of Phase 2 clinical bulk drug substance, and we expect to enter into a commercial supply agreement with a suitably qualified supplier prior to conducting pivotal clinical trials.
Drug Product. Drug product for Phase 1 and early Phase 2 studies has been manufactured by Kabs Pharmaceutical Services and effective July 31, 2016 we entered into an agreement with Patheon Manufacturing Services LLC to supply drug product for our clinical studies. 
Inclisiran
Under our agreement with Alnylam, Alnylam supplied the quantity of finished product required for the conduct of the first Phase 1 clinical trial and the first Phase 2 clinical trial of inclisiran. Alnylam bore the costs of these activities, subject to certain agreed upon caps. We have the sole right and responsibility to manufacture and supply licensed product for further development and commercialization under our development plan. We and Alnylam entered into a development supply agreement under which Alnylam agreed to transfer the manufacturing technology for the product to us or our third-party manufacturers. We have entered into agreements with two contract manufacturing organizations for the manufacture of clinical supplies of drug substance, and another manufacturing organization for the supply of drug product for use in clinical and non-clinical studies. 
Carbavance
Bulk Drug Substance. Prior to our acquisition of Carbavance, Rempex entered into a master services agreement with Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. and a research and manufacturing services agreement with DSM Fine Chemicals Austria Nfg GmbH (now Patheon Austria GmbH) for the supply of bulk drug substance for vaborbactam, the proprietary, novel beta-lactamase inhibitor used in Carbavance. We intend to enter into a long-term commercial supply agreement for the manufacture of bulk drug substance with Patheon. 
Drug Product. Prior to our acquisition of Carbavance, in June 2012, Rempex entered into a development and clinical supply agreement with Hospira Worldwide, Inc. for clinical supplies of vaborbactam. In September 2012, Rempex entered into a master services agreement with ACS Dobfar S.p.A. for additional clinical supplies of vaborbactam. We expect to enter into a long-term commercial supply agreement for the manufacture of both the beta-lactamase inhibitor and the carbapenem used in Carbavance.

Business Development Strategy
We are exploring potential global and regional collaboration opportunities for certain of our products and products in development. We believe that partnering with third parties has the potential to improve the performance of our marketed products and provide a viable platform to commercialize our products and products in development that are not yet approved, if and when they are approved and ready to be marketed.
We also continue to review opportunities to acquire products through licenses, product acquisitions and company acquisitions. We believe that we have proven capabilities in developing and commercializing in-licensed or acquired acute and intensive care drug candidates. In evaluating product acquisition candidates, we have focused on acquisition candidates that are either approved products or late stage products in development that offer improved solutions to our customers and leverage our business infrastructure. In addition, our acquisition strategy has been to acquire global rights for development compounds wherever possible. 
Competition
The development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive. We face competition from pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater capital resources, research and development capabilities and experience, and financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and human resources than we have. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors.
Our business strategy is based in part on us selectively licensing or acquiring and then developing clinical compound candidates or products approved for marketing. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy. However, the acquisition and licensing of pharmaceutical products is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies, which have acknowledged strategies to license and acquire products, may have competitive advantages, as may emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product acquisition. Established companies pursuing this strategy may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash flows and institutional experience.
In addition, our competitors may develop, market or license products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than any that have been or are being developed by us, or may obtain marketing approval for their products from the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. We compete, in the case of our marketed products, and expect to compete, in the cases of our products in development, on the basis of product efficacy, safety, ease of administration, price and economic value compared to drugs used in current practice or currently being developed.
Angiomax
Due to the incidence and severity of cardiovascular diseases, the market for anticoagulant therapies is large and competition is intense. There are a number of anticoagulant therapies currently on the market, awaiting regulatory approval or in development for the indications for which Angiomax is approved.
Angiomax competes primarily with heparin and treatment regimens combining heparin and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Heparin is widely used in patients with ischemic heart disease, including PCI procedures. Heparin is manufactured and distributed by a number of companies as a generic product and is sold at a price that is significantly less than the price for Angiomax. GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors include ReoPro from Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson/Centocor, Inc., Integrilin (eptifibatide) from Merck & Co., Inc., and Aggrastat (tirofiban) from Iroko Pharmaceuticals, LLC and MediCure Inc. Although their use may have decreased in recent years, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are widely used and some physicians believe they offer superior efficacy in high risk patients as compared to Angiomax.
In some circumstances, Angiomax competes with other anticoagulant drugs for the use of hospital financial resources. For example, many U.S. hospitals receive a fixed reimbursement amount per procedure for the angioplasties and other treatment procedures they perform. As this amount is not based on the actual expenses the hospital incurs, hospitals may choose to use either Angiomax or heparin or a combination of heparin and a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor but not necessarily more than one of these drugs.
Angiomax is now subject to generic competition. On July 2, 2015, the Federal Circuit Court ruled against us in our patent infringement litigation with Hospira, with respect to the ‘727 patent and the ‘343 patent, covering a more consistent and improved Angiomax drug product and the processes by which it is made. In its ruling, the Federal Circuit Court held the ‘727 patent and the ‘343 patent invalid. In July 2015, as a result of the Federal Circuit Court’s now vacated July 2, 2015 decision, we entered into a supply and distribution agreement with Sandoz under which we granted Sandoz the exclusive right to sell in the United States an authorized generic of Angiomax (bivalirudin). In July 2015, Hospira’s ANDAs for its generic versions of Angiomax were approved by the FDA and Hospira began selling its generic versions of Angiomax. On November 13, 2015, our petition for en banc review of the Federal Circuit Court’s July 2, 2015 decision was granted and the Federal Circuit Court vacated its July 2, 2015 decision. On 
 16

July 11, 2016, in an unanimous decision, the en banc Federal Circuit Court ruled in our favor by finding that the ‘727 patent and the ‘343 patent were not invalid under the “on sale” bar. Notwithstanding the Federal Circuit Court’s November 13, 2015 and July 11, 2016 decisions, due to the Federal Circuit Court’s July 2, 2015 decision and our resulting entry into a supply and distribution agreement with Sandoz and Hospira’s entry into the market, Angiomax is now subject to generic competition with the authorized generic and Hospira’s generic bivalirudin products. In addition, in our January 2012 settlement of our patent infringement litigation with APP, we entered into a license agreement with APP under which we granted it a non-exclusive license under the ‘727 patent and ‘343 patent to sell a generic bivalirudin for injection product under an APP ANDA in the United States beginning on May 1, 2019 and, in certain circumstances, on a date prior to May 1, 2019. The generic competition resulting from the Federal Circuit Court’s July 2, 2015 decision triggered APP’s right to sell its bivalirudin product upon approval of its ANDA. In November 2016, APP’s ANDA for its generic version of Angiomax was approved by the FDA and APP, through its affiliated company, Fresenius Kabi, commenced selling its generic version of Angiomax.
A number of other companies have filed ANDAs for their generic versions of Angiomax. The FDA has accepted for filing a 505(b)(2) NDA filed by Eagle for a ready to use liquid formulation of bivalirudin. Although Eagle received a complete response letter from the FDA in March 2016, if Eagle is ultimately successful in receiving FDA approval then Eagle may launch commercial sales of the product in the United States upon approval.
In addition to Hospira’s and APP’s generic versions of Angiomax, Sandoz’s authorized generic and, if approved, Eagle’s formulation of bivalirudin, Angiomax could be subject to generic competition in the United States from Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and its affiliates, or Teva, and Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. and affiliates, or Sun, under the conditions set forth in our respective settlement agreements with such parties and upon a final approval of each companies’ ANDA filings by the FDA. Other ANDA filers may commercialize their products ‘at risk’ if they receive final approval of their respective ANDA filings and are not subject to a Hatch-Waxman 30-month stay. In September 2016, Pliva Hrvatska DOO, an affiliate of Teva, received tentative approval for its ANDA filing for its generic version of Angiomax. Further, we remain in infringement litigation involving the '727 patent and '343 patent with the other ANDA filers as described in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of our infringement litigation. We may continue to incur substantial legal expenses related to these matters.
Ionsys
Ionsys competes with a number of injectable opioid delivery systems, including nurse-administered bolus injections and IV PCA. A potential patient-controlled competitor for Ionsys is an oral sufentanil dispensing system, Zalviso using NanoTab, which is in Phase 3 development by AcelRx, Inc. We believe that Ionsys has advantages over other patient-controlled systems due to its reduced potential for medication errors, a smaller overall opioid-related adverse event burden, improved postoperative mobility, fewer analgesic gaps, and reduced labor requirements.
Minocin IV
Minocin IV competes with other antibiotics that are used for the treatment of infections due to Acinetobacter. These include carbapenems, aninoglycosides and other beta-lactam agents. The predominant antibiotic agents used to treat multi-drug resistant Ancinetobacter infections are tigecycline, colistin and polymyxin B. These agents are used “off-label” for this pathogen, but are more established in the marketplace and are less expensive.
Orbactiv 
Orbactiv competes with a number of drugs that target gram-positive infections acquired in the community or hospital and treated in an outpatient setting or hospital. Competition in the market for therapeutic products that address serious gram‑positive bacterial infections is intense. Some of these products are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. The more established products include vancomycin, ceftaroline (Teflaro), clindamycin, daptomycin, linezolid and televancin (Vibativ), and recently approved products that may be competitive include Sivextro from Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc (now a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.) and Dalvance from Durata Therapeutics, Inc. (now a subsidiary of Allergan). Several companies have products in varying stages of development that, if approved, may compete with Orbactiv.
Acute Care Generic Products 
The acute care generic products will compete with their respective brand name reference products and other equivalent generic products that may be sold by APP and other third parties. We believe that our infrastructure and relationships with customers assist us in competing with respective brand name reference products and other equivalent generic products of the acute care generic products.

Patents, Proprietary Rights and Licenses 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to protect the products we acquire or license by obtaining and maintaining patent protection both in the United States and in other countries. We rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations, contractual restrictions and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We plan to prosecute and defend patents or patent applications we file, acquire or license.
Angiomax.  We have exclusively licensed from Biogen Idec and Health Research Inc., or HRI, patents and patent applications covering Angiomax and Angiomax analogs and other novel anticoagulants as compositions of matter, and processes for using Angiomax and Angiomax analogs and other novel anticoagulants. We also own two U.S. patents covering a more consistent and improved Angiomax drug product and the processes by which it is made. We have also filed and are currently prosecuting a number of patent applications relating to Angiomax in the United States and Europe.
The principal U.S. patents covering Angiomax include the ‘727 patent and the ‘343 patent and previously included the ‘404 patent. The ‘404 patent covered the composition of matter of Angiomax.  The ‘404 patent was set to expire in March 2010, but the term was extended to December 15, 2014 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, under the Hatch-Waxman Act. As a result of our study of Angiomax in the pediatric setting, we had an additional six-month period of pediatric exclusivity following expiration of the ‘404 patent.  This period of exclusivity expired in June 2015.
In the second half of 2009, the PTO issued to us the ‘727 patent and the ‘343 patent, covering a more consistent and improved Angiomax drug product and the processes by which it is made. The ‘727 patent and the ‘343 patent are set to expire in July 2029, which includes pediatric exclusivity. In response to Paragraph IV Certification Notice letters we received with respect to ANDAs filed by a number of parties with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Angiomax, we have filed lawsuits against the ANDA filers alleging patent infringement of the ‘727 patent and ‘343 patent. In September 2011, we settled our patent infringement litigation with Teva. In connection with the settlement, we entered into a license agreement with Teva under which we granted Teva a non-exclusive license under the ‘727 patent and ‘343 patent to sell a generic bivalirudin for injection product under a Teva ANDA in the United States beginning June 30, 2019 or earlier under certain conditions. The license agreement also contains a grant by Teva to us of an exclusive (except as to Teva) license under Teva’s bivalirudin patents and right to enforce Teva’s bivalirudin patents. In January 2012, we settled our patent infringement litigation with APP. In connection with the settlement, we entered into a license agreement with APP under which we granted APP a non-exclusive license under the ‘727 patent and ‘343 patent to sell a generic bivalirudin for injection product under an APP ANDA in the United States beginning on May 1, 2019. In addition, in certain limited circumstances, the license to APP could include the right to sell a generic bivalirudin product under our NDA for Angiomax in the United States beginning on May 1, 2019 or, in certain limited circumstances, on June 30, 2019 or on a date prior to May 1, 2019. Generic competition resulting from the Federal Circuit Court’s July 2, 2015 decision in our patent infringement litigation against Hospira triggered APP’s right to sell its bivalirudin product upon approval of its ANDA under the license agreement with APP. In March 2015, we settled our patent infringement litigation with Sun. In connection with the settlement, we entered into a license agreement with Sun under which we granted Sun a non-exclusive license under the ‘727 patent and ‘343 patent to sell a generic bivalirudin for injection product under Sun’s ANDA in the United States beginning on June 30, 2019 or earlier in certain circumstances. We remain in infringement litigation involving the ‘727 patent and ‘343 patent with the other ANDA filers. Our patent infringement litigation involving the ‘727 patent and ‘343 patent are described in more detail in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
In Europe, the principal patent covering Angiomax expired in August 2015. This patent covered the composition of matter of Angiomax. As a result, we do not have market exclusivity for Angiomax in Europe.
Ionsys. As a result of our acquisition of Incline, we acquired a portfolio of patents and patent applications covering the Ionsys device and its uses.  Some of these patents and patent applications were exclusively licensed from ALZA.  The expiration dates of patents covering the Ionsys device and its use range from December 2017 to February 2033 in the United States. In Europe, the expiration dates of patents covering the Ionsys device and its use range from October 2019 to March 2032. We are also currently prosecuting patent applications relating to Ionsys in the United States and in certain foreign countries.
Minocin. As a result of our acquisition of Rempex, we acquired a family of patent applications covering certain minocycline formulations and certain methods of administering minocycline.  We now have issued patents covering Minocin composition and certain methods of administering minocycline, each of which is set to expire in May 2031.  We are also prosecuting other patent applications relating to minocycline formulations and use in the United States and in certain foreign countries.
Orbactiv. As a result of our acquisition of Targanta, we obtained an exclusive license from Eli Lilly to patents and patent applications covering Orbactiv, its uses, formulations and analogs. Under this license, we are responsible for prosecuting and maintaining these patents and patent applications. The principal patent for Orbactiv that we acquired in our acquisition of Targanta was set to expire in the United States and Europe in November 2016. We have filed to extend the patent term for this patent through November 2020 in the United States and, while the filing is still under review, the patent has received an interim extension of one 
 18

year to November 2017. We also have issued patents directed to the process of making Orbactiv that are set to expire in 2017 if no patent term extension is obtained. We also have a U.S. patent covering the use of Orbactiv in treating certain skin infections that expires in August 2029 and an allowed patent application covering Orbactiv compositions, for which the resulting patent will expire in July 2035. In Europe, we have an issued patent with claims directed to Orbactiv composition for treating certain diseases, which expires in August 2029, and for which we are filing supplementary protection certificates in individual European countries to extend the patent term. We have also filed and are prosecuting a number of patent applications relating to Orbactiv and its uses in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.
Carbavance. As a result of our acquisition of Rempex, we acquired a portfolio of patent applications covering the composition of matter of Carbavance and its formulation and use. The principal U.S. patent for Carbavance is set to expire in August 2031 if no patent term extension is obtained. A corresponding patent application is pending in Europe and other foreign countries.  In addition, we are currently prosecuting other patent applications relating to Carbavance’s composition of matter and its use in the United States and in certain foreign countries.
Inclisiran. We have exclusively licensed from Alnylam patents covering RNAi therapeutics targeting PCSK9 for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and other human diseases for purposes of developing and commercializing such RNAi therapeutics. Some of these patents are directed to general RNAi technology and expire between 2020 and 2028 in the United States. Other patents are directed to compositions of the inclisiran product being developed under our license from Alnylam and to methods of treatment using such inclisiran product and the patents expire in 2027 and 2028 in the United States. In addition, Alnylam has filed and is prosecuting a number of patent applications in the United States and in certain foreign countries. One of these applications, which, if issued, expires in December 2033, contains claims directed to specific compositions of the inclisiran product we are developing and methods of administrating such compositions.
MDCO-700. In connection with our acquisition of Annovation, we obtained an exclusive license from The General Hospital Corporation pertaining to certain patents and patent applications covering MDCO-700 and its analogs. One of the patents contains claims directed specifically to MDCO-700 and expires in January 2033. These patent applications, some of which are jointly owned by Annovation and The General Hospital Corporation, are currently being prosecuted by The General Hospital Corporation in the United States and in certain foreign countries. We are also prosecuting certain other patent applications relating to MDCO-700.
The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms like us can be uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know whether any of the patent applications we acquire, license or file will result in the issuance of patents or, if any patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or will be challenged, circumvented or invalidated. Because unissued U.S. patent applications filed prior to November 29, 2000 and patent applications filed within the last 18 months are maintained in secrecy until patents issue, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the PTO to determine priority of invention, or in opposition proceedings in a foreign patent office. Participation in these proceedings could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Even issued patents may not be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using such technology.
The development of acute and intensive care hospital products is intensely competitive. A number of pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and research institutions have filed patent applications or received patents in this field. Some of these patent applications could be competitive with applications we have acquired or licensed, or could conflict in certain respects with claims made under our applications. Such conflict could result in a significant reduction of the coverage of the patents we have acquired or licensed, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if patents are issued to other companies that contain competitive or conflicting claims with claims of our patents and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid, we may not be able to obtain licenses to these patents at a reasonable cost, or develop or obtain alternative technology.
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. However, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques. Others may also otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology. We may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and consultants, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be our exclusive property. 
 19

These agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
We have a number of trademarks that we consider important to our business. The Medicines Company® name and logo, and Angiomax®, Angiox®, Carbavance®, Ionsys® and Orbactiv® names and logos are either our registered trademarks or our trademarks in the United States and other countries. We have also registered some of these marks in a number of foreign countries. Although we have a foreign trademark registration program for selected marks, we may not be able to register or use such marks in each foreign country in which we seek registration. We believe that our products are identified by our trademarks and, thus, our trademarks are of significant value. Each registered trademark has a duration of 10 to 15 years, depending on the date it was registered and the country in which it is registered, and is subject to an infinite number of renewals for a like period upon continued use and appropriate application. We intend to continue the use of our trademarks and to renew our registered trademarks based upon each trademark’s continued value to us.
License Agreements
A summary of our licenses for our products and products in development is set forth below.
Angiomax.  In March 1997, we entered into an agreement with Biogen, Inc., a predecessor of Biogen Idec, for the license of the anticoagulant pharmaceutical bivalirudin, which we have developed and market as Angiomax. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to the technology, patents, trademarks, inventories and know-how related to Angiomax. In exchange for the license, we paid $2.0 million on the closing date and are obligated to pay up to an additional $8.0 million upon the first commercial sales of Angiomax for the treatment of AMI in the United States and Europe. In addition, we are obligated to pay royalties on sales of Angiomax and on any sublicense royalties on a country-by-country basis earned until the later of the date 12 years after the date of the first commercial sales of the product in a country and the date on which the product or its manufacture, use or sale is no longer covered by a valid claim of the licensed patent rights in such country. The royalty rate due to Biogen Idec on sales increases as annual sales of Angiomax increase. Under the agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize Angiomax in the United States and specified European markets, including for PTCA and AMI indications. The license and rights under the agreement remain in force until our obligation to pay royalties ceases. Either party may terminate the agreement for material breach by the other party, if the material breach is not cured within 90 days’ after written notice. In addition, we may terminate the agreement for any reason upon 90 days’ prior written notice. During 2016, we incurred approximately $0.7 million in royalties related to Angiomax under our agreement with Biogen Idec. In August 2012, we and Biogen Idec amended the license agreement providing, among other things, that effective solely for the period from January 1, 2013 through and including December 15, 2014, each of the royalty rate percentages payable by us as set forth in the license agreement increased by one percentage point. As of December 15, 2014, we no longer owe royalties to Biogen Idec or HRI relating to sales of Angiomax in the United States. 
In March 1997, in connection with entering into the Biogen Idec license, Biogen Idec assigned to us a license agreement with HRI under which Biogen Idec had licensed HRI’s right to a specified patent application held jointly with Biogen Idec which resulted in a series of U.S. patents including the ‘404 patent. Under the terms of the agreement, we have exclusive worldwide rights to HRI’s rights to the licensed patent application and patents arising from the licensed patent application, other than rights for noncommercial research and educational purposes, which HRI retained. We are obligated to pay royalties on sales of Angiomax and on any sublicense income we earn. The royalty rate due to HRI on sales increases as annual sales of Angiomax increase. Under the agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to research and develop, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize Angiomax. The license and rights under the agreement remain in force until the expiration of the last remaining patent granted under the licensed patent application. HRI may terminate the agreement for a material breach by us, if the material breach is not cured within 90 days after written notice or, in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation or insolvency, immediately on written notice. In addition, we may terminate the agreement for any reason upon 90 days’ prior written notice upon payment of a termination fee equal to the minimum royalty fee payable under the license agreement. During 2016, we incurred approximately $0.1 million in royalties related to Angiomax under the agreement with HRI. As of December 15, 2014, we no longer owe royalties to HRI relating to sales of Angiomax in the United States.
Orbactiv.  As a result of our acquisition of Targanta, we are a party to a license agreement with Eli Lilly through our Targanta subsidiary. Under the terms of the agreement, we have exclusive worldwide rights to patents and other intellectual property related to Orbactiv and other compounds claimed in the licensed patent rights. We are required to make payments to Eli Lilly upon reaching specified regulatory and sales milestones. In addition, we are obligated to pay royalties based on net sales of products containing Orbactiv or the other compounds in any jurisdiction in which we hold license rights to a valid patent. The royalty rate due to Eli Lilly on sales increases as annual sales of these products increase. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for Orbactiv in the United States and to commercialize Orbactiv in the United States. If we breach that obligation, Eli Lilly may terminate our license in the United States, license rights to Orbactiv could revert to Eli Lilly and we would lose our rights to develop and commercialize Orbactiv. The license rights under the agreement remain in force, on a country-by-country basis, until there is no valid patent in such country and our obligation to pay royalties ceases in that country. Either party 
 20

may terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach by the other party. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s insolvency or bankruptcy.
Acute Care Generic Products. In January 2012, we entered into settlement documents with APP, including a license agreement with APP under which APP granted us a non-exclusive license under APP’s marketing authorizations and intellectual property to sell the acute care generic products to hospitals and integrated delivery networks in the United States. Under the settlement documents, we made a one-time, upfront payment of $32.0 million to APP. We also agreed to purchase our entire requirements for these products from APP for a price equal to APP’s cost of goods. The term of the license and supply agreement ends January 22, 2022. We and APP may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party, unless the material breach is cured within 90 days of written notice or within 120 days of written notice if the breach is incapable of being cured within the 90-day period. APP may terminate the agreement upon 60 days written notice if we fail to pay in full any invoice that is past due unless such payment is the subject of a dispute set forth in writing by us. We may terminate the agreement if, with respect to two purchase orders in a calendar year, APP has failed to supply at least the aggregate quantity of conforming product specified in the purchase order or failed to deliver the product prior to the applicable delivery date specified in the purchase order and APP has failed to cure these breaches in the manner specified in the agreement. In addition, either party may terminate the license and supply agreement on a product-by-product basis, effective immediately, upon written notice to the other party in the event the FDA takes any action the result of which is to permanently prohibit the manufacture of the product in the United States. APP may also terminate the license and supply agreement on a product-by-product basis upon 180 days written notice if APP has determined that it will discontinue the marketing authorization for the product in the United States. We may terminate the agreement on a product-by-product basis upon 180 days written notice if the total market value of a product falls below a specified percentage of the total market value of the product as of the effective date of the agreement. In the event that the agreement is terminated with respect to a product, the parties shall agree upon a substitute product.
Ionsys. As a result of our acquisition of Incline, we are a party to a license agreement with ALZA through our Incline subsidiary. Under the terms of the agreement, Incline acquired from ALZA certain rights to the Ionsys product and ALZA transferred to Incline specified trademarks, know-how, domain names and tangible assets relating to the Ionsys product. ALZA also granted Incline worldwide licenses under specified patent rights and know-how to develop, manufacture and commercialize iontophoretic transdermal systems providing delivery under the influence of an electric current which is from a source external to the human body of specified fentanyl analogs. The licenses granted by ALZA under the agreement are exclusive with respect to specified patent rights and know-how and nonexclusive under other specified patent rights. 
We, through our subsidiary, Incline have the sole responsibility for the development and commercialization of licensed products under the agreement, and are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Spain.
In addition to the other rights and licenses granted to Incline under the ALZA Agreement, if, at any time during the 10-year period following the date of the agreement, ALZA wishes to grant a license under specified licensed patents to a third party, other than in connection with the settlement of litigation, to develop, manufacture and/or commercialize specified systems that deliver opioid compounds or combinations of opioid compounds with fentanyl analogs or generic compounds, in each case that do not contain any active compound that is proprietary to, licensed by or otherwise controlled by the third party or, except for specified fentanyl analogs, by ALZA, then we will have a right of first negotiation to obtain the proposed license.
If, at any time during the 10-year period following the date of the agreement, we wish to obtain from ALZA a license under specified licensed patents to develop, manufacture and/or commercialize specified systems that deliver generic compounds, combinations of generic compounds with fentanyl analogs or compounds exclusively owned, licensed or otherwise controlled by Incline, alone or in combination with generic compounds or specified fentanyl analogs, in each case that do not contain any active compound, other than specified fentanyl analogs, that is proprietary to, licensed by or otherwise controlled by ALZA or that is a generic drug owned, licensed or controlled by ALZA, then upon notice to ALZA of our desire to obtain the license, ALZA will be obligated to negotiate in good faith with Incline to grant the proposed license.
Under the ALZA Agreement, Incline paid ALZA an upfront payment and we will be obligated to pay ALZA up to an aggregate of $32.5 million in regulatory and commercial launch milestone payments and up to an aggregate of $83.0 million in sales milestone payments if certain specified milestones are met. ALZA is also entitled to specified royalties based on net sales of licensed products, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, during the period commencing on the first commercial sale of the licensed product in the applicable country and ending on the latest of the expiration of the licensed patents covering the licensed product, the expiration of applicable regulatory exclusivity or the 20th anniversary of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in the applicable country. We will also be required to pay amounts that become payable, if any, under specified ALZA third party licenses as a result of our development and commercialization of licensed products.
Either ALZA or we may terminate the agreement due to the other party’s material breach of the agreement if such breach is not cured within 60 days of notice of the breach except that if the breach relates solely to the United States, any country in Europe or any other country in the world, the termination right shall apply to the United States, applicable countries in Europe or the rest of 
 21

the world (other than the US and Europe), as the case may be. ALZA may also terminate the agreement due to our bankruptcy. Neither party has any discretionary right to terminate the agreement. If not terminated earlier pursuant to its terms, the agreement terminates upon the expiration and satisfaction of all payment obligations under the agreement.
Alnylam License Agreement. In February 2013, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam to develop, manufacture and commercialize therapeutic products targeting the human PCSK-9 gene based on certain of Alnylam’s RNAi technology. Under the terms of the agreement, we obtained the exclusive, worldwide right under Alnylam’s technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize PCSK-9 products for the treatment, palliation and/or prevention of all human diseases. We paid Alnylam $25.0 million in an initial license payment and agreed to pay up to $180.0 million in success-based development and commercialization milestones. In addition, Alnylam will be eligible to receive scaled double-digit royalties based on annual worldwide net sales of PCSK-9 products by us or our affiliates and sublicensees. Royalties to Alnylam are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the last to occur of the expiration of patent rights in the applicable country that cover the applicable product, the expiration of non-patent regulatory exclusivities for such product in such country, and the twelfth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. The royalties are subject to reduction in specified circumstances. We are also responsible for paying royalties, and in some cases milestone payments, owed by Alnylam to its licensors with respect to intellectual property covering these products.
The agreement expires when the last royalty term expires under the agreement, unless earlier terminated. We may terminate the agreement at any time with four months prior written notice to Alnylam. Either party may terminate the agreement on 60 days (10 days in the event of a payment breach) prior written notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such breach within the applicable notice period. Such cure period may be extended in certain circumstances. If the agreement is terminated by us for convenience or by Alnylam for our uncured material breach or challenge of the patents licensed from Alnylam, we have agreed to grant a license to Alnylam under certain of its technology developed in the course of our activities under the agreement, subject to a royalty to be negotiated between the parties, and we will provide certain other assistance to Alnylam to continue the development and commercialization of the products. The exclusivity restrictions imposed on us will survive termination of the agreement for specified periods of time if we terminate the agreement for convenience or if Alnylam terminates the agreement for cause or for a patent challenge by us. 
MDCO-700. As a result of our acquisition of Annovation, we, through our subsidiary Annovation, are a party to a license agreement with The General Hospital Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, Annovation licensed from the General Hospital Corporation exclusive worldwide rights to certain patents, patent applications and other intellectual property related to MDCO-700. We will be obligated to pay General Hospital Corporation up to an aggregate of $6.5 million upon achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales milestones. In addition, we will be obligated to pay General Hospital Corporation low single-digit percentage royalties on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis based on net sales of MDCO-700 products until the later of the duration of the licensed patent rights which are necessary to manufacture, use or sell MDCO-700 products in a country and the date ten years from our first commercial sale of MDCO-700 products in such country. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the MDCO-700 product and achieve specified stages of clinical development within specified time periods.
Customers
We currently sell branded Angiomax, Minocin IV and Orbactiv in the United States to our sole source distributor, ICS. ICS accounted for 71%, 88% and 94% of our net product revenue for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, amounts due from ICS represented approximately $6.2 million and $33.2 million, or 25% and 47%, of gross accounts receivable, respectively. We also have a supply and distribution arrangement with Sandoz under which Sandoz sells authorized generic Angiomax (bivalirudin) in the United States. Product sales to Sandoz accounted for 17% and 4% of our net product revenues for 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, amounts due from Sandoz related to product sales were approximately $5.6 million or 22% and $3.0 million or 4%, respectively, of gross accounts receivable. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, amounts due from Sandoz related to royalty revenues represented approximately $9.1 million or 36% and $29.4 million or 42%, respectively, of gross accounts receivable. 
Government Regulation 
Government authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate the research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, advertising, promotion, storage, sales, distribution, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our products and product candidates. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologics, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act respectively and their implementing regulations. We cannot market or commercially distribute a drug until we have submitted an application for marketing authorization to the FDA, and the FDA has approved it. Both before and after approval is obtained, violations of regulatory requirements may result in various adverse consequences, including, among other things, clinical holds, untitled letters, warning letters, fines and other monetary penalties, the FDA’s delay in approving or refusal to approve a product, product recall or seizure, suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, interruption 
 22

of production, operating restrictions, injunctions and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. The steps required before a drug may be approved by the FDA and marketed in the United States generally include:

• | pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.

Pre-Clinical Tests
Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, study protocols, and other information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA puts the trial on clinical hold because of concerns or questions about issues such as the design of the trials or the safety of the drug for administration to humans. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. Submission of an IND does not necessarily result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. In addition, the FDA may impose a clinical hold on an ongoing clinical trial if, for example, safety concerns arise, in which case the trial cannot recommence without the FDA’s authorization.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring subject safety, and the effectiveness criteria, or endpoints, to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and the FDA may or may not allow that trial to proceed. Each trial also must be reviewed and approved by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, at each proposed study site before it can begin.
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into people to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to:

• | evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage;


• | identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and


• | evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific indications.

Phase 3 trials typically involve administration of the drug to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. We cannot guarantee that Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. Furthermore, we, the IRB, or the FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
Sponsors are required to publicly disseminate information about ongoing and completed clinical trials on a government website administered by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and are subject to civil money penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions for failing to meet these obligations.
Sponsors of drugs may apply for a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, from the FDA.  The SPA process is a procedure by which the FDA provides official evaluation and written guidance on the design and size of proposed protocols that are intended to form the primary basis for determining a drug product’s efficacy. Even if the FDA agrees on the design, execution and analyses 
 23

proposed in protocols reviewed under an SPA, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement if, among other reasons, new public health concerns emerge or the relevant assumptions change or are determined to be inaccurate. Moreover, an SPA does not guarantee approval, which depends on the results of the trials, the adverse event profile, and an evaluation of the benefit/risk profile of the drug product.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical studies and of the clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of an NDA or BLA typically requires the payment of a significant user fee to FDA. Before approving an application, the FDA usually will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured, and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA also often inspects one or more sites at which the pivotal clinical trial or trials were conducted to ensure the integrity of the data and compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements. If the FDA determines the application, data or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, the FDA may outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. As a condition of approval of an application, the FDA may request or require post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. The FDA also may impose requirements designed to ensure the safety of the drug up to and including distribution and use restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS. After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval before the changes can be implemented. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
The FDA regulates combinations of products that cross FDA centers, such as drug, biologic or medical device components that are physically, chemically or otherwise combined into a single entity, as a combination product. The FDA center with primary jurisdiction for the combination product will take the lead in the premarket review of the product, with the other center consulting or collaborating with the lead center, and often will require approval of only a single application, such as an NDA or BLA. The FDA’s Office of Combination Products, or OCP, determines which center will have primary jurisdiction for the combination product based on the combination product’s “primary mode of action.” A mode of action is the means by which a product achieves an intended therapeutic effect or action. The primary mode of action is the mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product, or the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product. For example, our Ionsys product is considered to be a combination drug-device product, but because it has a primary mode of action of a drug, it has been approved under an NDA by FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER.
Manufacturing Requirements
After the FDA approves a product, we, our suppliers, and our contract manufacturers must comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approved NDA or BLA are required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, we and our contract manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. In addition, discovery of problems such as safety problems may result in changes in labeling, imposition or modification of a REMS, or other restrictions on a product manufacturer, or NDA or BLA holder, including removal of the product from the market.
We use and will continue to use third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and we cannot be sure that future FDA inspections will not identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Also, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications and Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
Once an NDA is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a listed drug that can, in turn, be relied upon by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. The FDA may approve an ANDA if the product is the same in important respects as the listed drug or if the FDA has declared it suitable for an ANDA submission. In these situations, applicants must submit studies showing that the product is bioequivalent to the listed drug, meaning that the rate and extent of absorption of the drug does not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their 
 24

drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Conducting bioequivalence studies is generally less time-consuming and costly than conducting pre-clinical and clinical trials necessary to support an NDA or BLA. Drugs approved via ANDAs on the basis that they are the “same” as a listed drug are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be and are substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. A number of ANDAs have been filed with respect to Angiomax. The regulations governing marketing exclusivity and patent protection are complex, and until the outcomes of our effort to extend the patent term and our patent infringement litigation, we may not know the disposition of such ANDA submissions.
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. An ANDA applicant relying upon a listed drug is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the listed drug product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 

• | the required patent information has not been filed;


• | the listed patent has expired;


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the new product.

A certification that the proposed generic product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification notice automatically prevents the FDA from granting final approval to the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
The ANDA also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity period, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, for the referenced product has expired, unless the exclusivity period protects an indication or other aspect of labeling that can be “carved out” of the labeling for the proposed generic product. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active moiety during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA if a listed drug contains a previously approved active moiety but FDA requires as a condition of approval new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination, or indication. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, federal law also provides that periods of patent and non-patent marketing exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for a drug may be extended by six months if the NDA sponsor conducts pediatric studies identified by the FDA in a written request. For written requests issued by the FDA after September 27, 2007, the date of enactment of the Food and Drug Administrative Amendment Act (FDAAA), the FDA must grant pediatric exclusivity no later than nine months prior to the date of expiration of patent or non-patent exclusivity in order for the six-month pediatric extension to apply to that exclusivity period. 
Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application. 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication(s) sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 25

To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would be required to do so. As a result, approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be prevented until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act
Under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, enacted in the United States in 2010, the FDA now has the authority to approve biosimilar and interchangeable versions of previously-approved biological products through an abbreviated pathway following periods of data and marketing exclusivity. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to show its molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic, also known as a reference product, address the challenges of biologics manufacturing, and include a certain amount of safety and efficacy data which the FDA will evaluate on a case-by-case basis. A competitor seeking approval of an interchangeable biological product must demonstrate not only biosimilarity but also that the products can be expected to produce the same clinical effects in any given patient. Under the data protection provisions of this law, the FDA cannot accept a biosimilar application until four years, or approve a biosimilar application until 12 years, after initial marketing approval of the reference product. Although the FDA has issued draft guidance documents, to date it has not issued any regulations or final guidance explaining how it will implement the abbreviated BLA or biosimilar provisions enacted in 2010 under the BPCIA, including the exclusivity provisions for reference products. Regulators in the European Union and other countries also have been given the authority to approve biosimilars. The extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be approved as interchangeable with or substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biologic products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. A number of states have recently considered and, in some cases, adopted legislation governing the substitution of interchangeable biosimilars for the reference product.
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, which was amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. The PPACA, as amended, contains numerous provisions that impact the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries and it empowers the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to implement a number of related healthcare reform, or HCR, measures that are likely to have a broad impact on the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry. We are continually evaluating the impact of the PPACA and other HCR-related programs and regulations on our business, including potential PPACA repeal and replacement. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not identified any provisions that currently materially impact our business and results of operations. However, the potential impact of the PPACA and other HCR measures on our business and results of operations is inherently difficult to predict because many of the details regarding the implementation of this legislation have not been determined. In addition, the impact on our business and results of operations may change as and if our business evolves. President Trump and HHS Secretary Price have announced support for a repeal of PPACA and a number of other HCR programs initiated under the Obama administration. It remains unclear whether replacement programs will include similar limitations affecting reimbursement, although scrutiny over drug pricing and government costs is expected to continue. Similarly, efforts in Congress to reform Medicare and Medicaid may impact the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries.
“Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now,” Provisions of Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act
On July 9, 2012, President Obama signed the FDASIA. Under the GAIN provisions of FDASIA, the FDA may designate a product as a qualified infectious disease product, or QIDP. A QIDP is defined as an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by either an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens or a so-called “qualifying pathogen” found on a list of potentially dangerous, drug-resistant organisms to be established and maintained by the FDA under the new law. The GAIN provisions describe several examples of “qualifying pathogens,” including MRSA and Clostridium difficile. Upon the designation of a drug by the FDA as a QIDP, any non-patent exclusivity period awarded to the drug will be extended by an additional five years.  This extension is in addition to any pediatric exclusivity extension awarded.  
We developed Orbactiv for the treatment of ABSSSI, including infections caused by MRSA, and are exploring the development of Orbactiv for other indications, including ABSSSI in children, uncomplicated bacteremia and other gram-positive bacterial infections. We developed the new formulation of Minocin IV, which is approved by the FDA, for the treatment of infections due to susceptible strains of designated gram-negative bacteria, including those due to Acinetobacter spp, and designated gram-positive bacteria. We are also developing Carbavance for the treatment of hospitalized patients with serious gram-negative bacterial infections. In November 2013, the FDA designated Orbactiv a QIDP. In August 2014, following approval of Orbactiv, the FDA informed us 
 26

that Orbactiv met the criteria for an additional five years of non-patent exclusivity to be added to the five year exclusivity period already provided by the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. As a result, Orbactiv’s non-patent regulatory exclusivity is scheduled to expire in August 2024. In December 2013, the FDA designated Carbavance a QIDP. We expect that, if we submit an NDA for Carbavance and the NDA is approved, Carbavance would receive an additional five years of non-patent exclusivity. In April 2015, the FDA designated the new formulation of Minocin IV a QIDP for certain additional potential indications involving gram-negative bacteria, and we expect that if we submit a supplemental NDA for one or more of those indications and such supplemental NDA is approved, Minocin IV would receive an additional five years of non-patent exclusivity with respect to such indications.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payers, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. 
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive health economic studies in order to demonstrate the economics of the product, in addition to incurring the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically reasonable or necessary or economically viable. Even if a drug product is covered, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and economic benefit of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payers do not consider our products to be economically beneficial compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. Third-party payers may provide coverage, but place stringent limitations on such coverage, such as requiring alternative treatments to be tried first. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, in a final rule adopted in 2016 regarding the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System, CMS finalized a proposal to “bundle” reimbursement for certain hospital outpatient observation services with payment for a number of medicines used in connection with those services. This bundling policy could affect Orbactiv once its Medicare “pass-through” status expires, potentially in 2018. This particular policy is one example of a broader trend in health care in which the government and other payors are seeking to move from individualized “fee for service” payments toward a system focused on “bundled” payments for more comprehensive packages of services and episodes of care.  Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug product candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.
Pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. 
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third party reimbursement 
 27

rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Foreign Regulations
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA or BLA in the United States is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Drugs can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
Centralized EMA Procedure.  The EMA, formerly the EMEA, implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Union. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines.
For drugs that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the drug concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
National EMA Procedures.  There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products outside the scope of the centralized procedure:

• | Decentralised procedure. Using the decentralised procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralised procedure. 


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union member state, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
