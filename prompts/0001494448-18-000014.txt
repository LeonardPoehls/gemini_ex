Item 1. Business
Overview
Emergent Capital, Inc. was founded in December 2006 as a Florida limited liability company, Imperial Holdings, LLC, and converted into Imperial Holdings, Inc. on February 3, 2011, in connection with the Company’s initial public offering. Effective September 1, 2015, the name was changed to Emergent Capital, Inc. (with its subsidiary companies, the "Company" or "Emergent Capital").
Emergent Capital, through its subsidiary companies, owns a portfolio of 608 life insurance policies, also referred to as life settlements, with a fair value of $567.5 million and an aggregate death benefit of approximately $2.9 billion at December 31, 2017. The Company primarily earns income on these policies from changes in their fair value and through death benefits. 
Life Settlements Portfolio & Portfolio Management
The life insurance policies in Emergent Capital’s portfolio were acquired through a combination of direct policy purchases from the original policy owners (the secondary market), purchases of policies owned by other institutional investors (the tertiary market) and from policy surrenders or foreclosures in satisfaction of loans issued under the Company’s legacy premium finance business. Emergent Capital uses a probabilistic method of valuing life insurance policies, meaning the insured individual’s probability of survival and probability of death are applied to the required premiums and net death benefit of the policy to extrapolate the likely cash flows over the life expectancy of the insured. These likely cash flows are then discounted using a net present value formula. Management believes this to be the preferred valuation method in the industry at the present time.
Until a policy matures, the Company must pay ongoing premiums to keep that policy in force and to prevent it from lapsing. Upon a policy lapse, the Company would suffer a complete loss on its investment in that policy. Accordingly, the Company must proactively manage its cash in order to effectively run its business, maintain liquidity and continue to pay premiums in order to maintain the policies in its portfolio. 606 of these policies, with an aggregate death benefit of approximately $2.9 billion and a fair value of approximately $566.7 million at December 31, 2017, are pledged under a $370.0 million, revolving credit agreement (the "White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility") entered into by the Company’s indirect subsidiary, White Eagle Asset Portfolio, LP ("White Eagle"). At December 31, 2017, 2 policies owned by the Company, with an aggregate death benefit of approximately $12.0 million and a fair value of $750,000 were not pledged as collateral under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility.
Regulation
The sale and solicitation of life insurance policies in the secondary market is highly regulated by the laws and regulations of individual states and other applicable jurisdictions. The purchase of a policy directly from a policy owner is referred to as a life settlement and is regulated on a state-by-state basis.
At December 31, 2017, the Company, through its subsidiary Imperial Life Settlements, LLC, maintained licenses to transact life settlements as a provider in 28 of the states that currently require a license and was qualified to conduct business in 37 states and the District of Columbia.
The primary regulator for Imperial Life Settlements, LLC when purchasing life settlements in the secondary market is the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. A majority of the state laws and regulations concerning life settlements relate to: (i) provider and broker licensing requirements; (ii) reporting requirements; (iii) required contract provisions and disclosures; (iv) privacy requirements; (v) fraud prevention measures; (vi) criminal and civil remedies; (vii) marketing requirements; (viii) the time period in which policies cannot be sold in life settlement transactions; and (ix) other rules governing the relationship between policy owners, insured persons, insurers, and others.
Competition
Competition is primarily through two channels: life settlement providers and institutional investors. In order to be a life settlement provider and transact with the original holder of a life insurance policy, in most instances, a license on a state-by-state basis is required. The life settlement business is highly fragmented and, therefore, competition is diverse. Often, life settlement providers are originating life settlements on behalf of institutional investors who do not maintain the necessary

licenses to transact in the secondary market for life insurance. These investors may have significantly more resources than the Company and can generally also transact directly in the tertiary market.
