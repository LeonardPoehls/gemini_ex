 Marketplaces
 Leaf Group’s Marketplaces segment includes art and design marketplaces that serve a global community of approximately 380,000 independent artists. Our marketplaces empower artists to reach a global audience of art lovers and design conscious buyers and earn a living or supplement their income while pursuing their passion, while we handle various marketing, promotion, and logistics, such as coordination of made-to-order production, global shipping and payment processing. Through our portfolio of marketplace brands, we create compelling and differentiated experiences that serve the needs of an attractive demographic of art enthusiasts and design conscious consumers throughout their key life stages. Our marketplace brands are distinguished by the diversity and quality of available products, high caliber of artists and superior customer service that we provide to both artists and buyers.
 Our portfolio of marketplace brands includes:
     Made-to-order marketplaces.  We operate artist-driven, made-to-order digital commerce marketplaces where large communities of artists and designers can market and sell their original art and designs printed on a wide variety of products. Our distinct made-to-order marketplaces target diverse demographics across multiple channels and operate as an integrated business, which allows for strategic and advantageous partnerships with our third party vendors and suppliers.

  Media
 Leaf Group’s Media segment consists of a diverse portfolio of media properties that educate and inform consumers on a broad range of topics. Our media properties enable a large community of subject matter experts to share their knowledge and passion with consumers across the internet.

 Brands.  Our portfolio of owned and operated media properties includes Livestrong.com, Hunker, eHow and Cuteness.com, as well as approximately 20 other media properties that are focused on specific topics or interests. Collectively, our owned and operated media properties reached over 50 million average monthly unique visitors in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2017 according to comScore.

      Content Creation. We create high-quality, informative and entertaining digital content in a wide variety of formats including videos, articles and slideshows. We use a combination of internal editorial staff, freelance contributors and social influencers to produce this content. Our platform uses advanced algorithms to identify the questions or topics that are on consumers’ minds. Our platform also manages the development, refinement and eventually the publishing of this content to the web, email and social channels. Our mission is to connect the knowledge and the passion of an expert with interested and curious consumers.

 Traffic Sources. Consumers can find our content through a variety of modern digital distribution channels including search, social networks, email campaigns and direct navigation. Once a consumer discovers us, we make it easier for them to follow us on social networks, share our content with friends and sign-up for our newsletters. We have a large and growing following across social networks including Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram.
 Mobile Applications.  Our media portfolio also includes mobile applications. MyPlate, our most successful app, is integrated into our Livestrong.com brand. As of December 2017, MyPlate was used by over 410,000 consumers to track their calories and improve their diet. MyPlate is monetized via ads, sponsorships and a premium subscription offering that unlocks advanced features.
 Monetization.  Each of our owned and operated properties is designed to optimize revenues from a diverse set of buyers. We carefully maximize yield across the monetization ad stack between direct brand, programmatic and third parties, each representing a different value bracket. We engage directly with brands on unique content and sponsorship opportunities to connect with our diverse consumers. We also leverage programmatic tools and proprietary data to connect advertisers with valuable audiences across our media properties.
 Partner Sites. Some of our websites were developed in coordination with other media companies and publishers. In these cases, we create, maintain and host content that exists on the partner’s sub-domain and is seamlessly integrated into our partner’s website. Revenues from this content are shared with the partner. We currently have 25 such hosted properties in our portfolio of media properties
 Technology 
 Our technologies include software applications built to run on independent clusters of standard and commercially available servers located at co-location facilities in North America. We make substantial use of off-the-shelf available open-source technologies such as Linux, PHP, MySQL, Redis, mongoDB, Memcache, Elasticsearch and Couchbase. These systems are connected to the internet via load balancers, firewalls, and routers installed in multiple redundant pairs. We also utilize third party services to geographically deliver data using major content delivery network (“CDN”) providers, such as Akamai. Virtualization is heavily deployed throughout our technology architecture, which affords scaling numerous properties in an efficient and cost effective manner. Enterprise class storage systems provide redundancy in order to maintain continued and seamless system availability in the event of most component failures.
 Our business intelligence platform and financial systems are hosted in a Tier IV data center alongside most of our public facing Media websites and applications. Some of our Marketplaces websites are hosted with a third party cloud hosting provider. Each of our significant websites is designed to be fault-tolerant, with collections of application servers, typically configured in a load balanced state, in order to provide additional resiliency. Our environment is equipped with a full-scale monitoring solution, which includes an outsourced network operations center that is continuously staffed.
 International Operations
 We provide our products and services to consumers around the world. Our marketplaces are available to artists and buyers globally and while it is still a small part of our outsourced production process, we work with international vendors in the Asia-Pacific and European regions to more efficiently ship products to customers and we will continue to look for opportunities to work with additional international vendors. In addition, Saatchi Art’s The Other Art Fair currently hosts art fairs in the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States. 
 Information regarding financial data by geographic areas is set forth in Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15, “Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and additional information regarding certain risks associated with our international operations is provided under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Customers
 The products and artwork sold through our Marketplaces segment are primarily sold directly to consumers. We also distribute products through third party retailers and sell products and artwork to trade professionals and commercial customers.
 Our Media customers currently include advertisers and advertising providers that purchase advertising space on our owned and operated media properties, as well as third party brands, publishers and advertisers for whom we create and, in some cases, host content. Our advertising strategy is currently focused on both direct sales channels with brands and advertising agencies, particularly with respect to native and sponsored ad campaigns, and programmatic offerings that utilize various advertising network exchanges to manage our ad stack. A significant portion of the advertising revenue generated by our Media business is derived from our agreements with Google. See “Item 1A.  Risk Factors—We depend upon certain arrangements with Google for a significant portion of our revenue. A termination of, or a loss of revenue generated from, our agreements with Google would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
     Competition
 We operate in highly competitive and developing industries that are characterized by rapid technological change, various business models and frequent disruption of incumbents by innovative entrants.
 Marketplaces. Our art and design marketplaces compete with a wide variety of online and brick-and-mortar companies selling comparable products. Our made-to-order marketplaces, Society6 and Deny Designs, primarily compete with companies that also utilize a made-to-order business model whereby consumer products featuring artist designs are produced by third party fulfillment partners and shipped directly to customers, such as RedBubble and Threadless, as well as companies that offer broader home décor and apparel products for creative, design conscious consumers, such as Etsy, Wayfair, Urban Outfitters, and West Elm. Our fine art marketplace, Saatchi Art, competes with traditional offline art galleries, art consultants, and online platforms selling original artwork such as Artfinder, Artspace, Rise Art, eBay and Amazon Art, as well as various art fairs that feature reasonably priced artwork from emerging artists such as The Affordable Art Fair. Our marketplaces must successfully attract, retain and engage both buyers and sellers to use our platforms and attend our fairs. We believe that the principal competitive factors for such marketplaces include the quality, price and uniqueness of the products, artwork or services being offered; the selection of goods and artists featured; the ability to source numerous products efficiently and cost-effectively with respect to our made-to-order products; customer service; the convenience and ease of the shopping experience we provide; and our reputation and brand strength. We expect competition to continue to intensify as online and offline businesses increasingly compete with each other and the barriers to enter online channels are reduced. 
 Media. We face intense competition for the properties within our Media segment from a wide range of competitors. These markets are rapidly evolving, highly fragmented and competition could increase in the future as more companies enter the space. We compete for advertisers on the basis of a number of factors, including return on marketing expenditures, price of our offerings, and the ability to deliver large audiences or precise types of segmented audiences. Our principal competitors in this space currently include various online media companies ranging from large internet media companies to specialized and enthusiast properties that focus on particular areas of consumer interest, as well as social media outlets such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Pinterest, where brands and advertisers are focusing a significant portion of their online advertising spend in order to connect with their customers. Some of our competitors have larger audiences and more financial resources than we have and many of our competitors are making significant investments in order to compete with various aspects of our business. 
 Many of our current Marketplaces and Media competitors have, and potential competitors may have, substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have; greater technical capabilities; greater brand recognition; longer operating histories; differentiated products and services; and larger customer bases. These resources may help some of our competitors and potential competitors respond more quickly as the industry and technology evolves, focus more on product innovation, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and system development than we do. Additional information regarding competition is included under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Intellectual Property
 Our intellectual property consists of trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights and trade secrets, and is, in the aggregate, important to our business. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, including trademarks, patents, copyrights, and trade secret laws, together with contractual provisions and technical measures that we have implemented. We rely more heavily on trade secret protection than patent protection. To protect our trade secrets, we maintain strict control access to our proprietary systems and technology, including our platforms, infrastructure and production environments. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with third parties that provide products and services to us. We also license certain trademarks, tradenames and/or copyrights through long-term license arrangements.
 We have trademarks registered in the United States and in various countries (some of which are registered in multiple classes) for some of our core properties, including “Society6”, “Hunker”, “Cuteness” and “eHow”, and we have additional trademark applications pending in the United States and other jurisdictions. We also have patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other jurisdictions with respect to certain methods, processes and technologies related to our Media segment that expire between 2027 and 2034, and we have patent applications pending in the United States and other jurisdictions specific to our Media segment. We believe that the duration of our patents is adequate for the current needs of our business. We generally do not register the copyrights associated with our Media content with the United States Copyright Office due to the relatively high costs we would incur to register all of our copyrights.
 In addition to the intellectual property we own, we also have perpetual licenses to use the “Saatchi” name in connection with our Saatchi Art marketplace and the “Livestrong.com” name in connection with our Livestrong.com media property, in each case, as permitted by the terms of intellectual property or licensing agreements with the third parties who retain the perpetual ownership rights to such names. Additional information regarding certain risks related to our intellectual property is included under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Regulation
 We are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, including laws and regulations relating to freedom of expression; information security; data privacy and data collection; pricing and fees; employment related matters; online content and the distribution of content; intellectual property rights, including secondary liability for infringement by others; product liability claims; taxation, including sales and value-added taxes (“VAT”); online advertising and marketing, including email marketing, unsolicited commercial email, native advertising and sponsored content; and the use of social media influencers. 
 In the United States, Congress has adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the internet, including the Communications Decency Act, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Lanham Act, the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, the CAN-SPAM Act, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and the Federal Trade Commission Act. Advertising and promotional information presented to visitors on our online properties, our related social media channels and through our other marketing activities are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern unfair and deceptive practices. Because we operate large consumer-facing media properties and marketplace platforms, we are also subject to state, federal and foreign laws and regulations governing privacy of users’ search and purchasing habits and other information, including requirements related to the collection and protection of consumers’ non-public personal information, user preferences and similar personal data. We believe that we will also be subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which was enacted in the European Union in May 2016, becomes effective in May 2018 and relates to data protection and privacy.
 We must also comply with certain foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and the economic and trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and the U.S. Commerce Department based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. Additionally,

some of the products and services we provide to customers globally may require approval under applicable U.S. export and customs laws. 
 Federal, state, local and foreign governments are also considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate the internet in more and different ways than exist today, including with respect to taxes. New laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may significantly impact our business. The costs of compliance with the various laws and regulations applicable to us are high and may increase in the future and any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may subject us to additional liabilities and penalties. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 286 employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are good. Seasonality
 Our Marketplaces service offering is affected by traditional retail seasonality and there is generally increased sales activity on our marketplaces platforms during the third and fourth quarter back-to-school and holiday seasons. Both our Marketplaces and Media service offerings are also affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, which generally slows in the first quarter of the calendar year as well as during the summer months. These seasonal trends have caused, and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results. Available Information
 We file reports with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any other filings required by the SEC. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available free of charge in the investor relations section of our corporate website (http://ir.leafgroup.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.

The SEC maintains an internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
 We webcast our earnings calls and certain events we participate in or host with members of the investment community on the investor relations section of our corporate website. Additionally, we provide notifications of news or announcements regarding our financial performance, including SEC filings, investor events, and press and earnings releases, on the investor relations section of our corporate website.
