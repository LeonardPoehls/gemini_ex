ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
 
Integral Technologies, Inc. ("Integral," the "Company" or "we") is, incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 12, 1996.  To date, we have expended resources on the research and development of several different types of technologies.
 
Integral focuses the majority of its resources on researching, developing and commercializing its ElectriPlast® technologies. The technology possesses a multitude of applications in a myriad of industries. These include the auto industry, the aerospace, consumer electronics, and commercial aviation industries, among others. One key factor that could drive demand for ElectriPlast is the need for light-weighting. Automotive and aerospace are leading the way to achieve reduced emissions and increased fuel economy. Light-weighting involves the substitution of lighter materials, often times using carbon-fiber based, for heavier (aluminum and other metals) materials.
 
On May 21, 2010, the Obama administration asked the EPA and NHTSA to jointly develop a national program that would “produce a new generation of clean vehicles,” to lower oil usage. The government mandated that auto manufacturers comply with CAFÉ (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards by the year 2025. To become more energy efficient, auto manufacturers are required to have their fleets achieving 54.5 MPG (miles per gallon) by then. According to a 2009 issue of Car and Driver Magazine, in 2009, car fleets averaged 32.5 CAFE MPG and trucks averaged 24.5 MPG. The Trump administration has indicated it will lessen the CAFE requirements, however it is unclear what changes will be made and its effect on the requirements set by the previous administration, but globally, the trend remains an increase in CAFE standards. More importantly, countries have begun to explore a zero emissions policy which would ban internal combustion engines in favor of zero emission power systems, such as battery electric vehicles.
 
We apply a significant portion of our resources to the protection of our intellectual property through patent filings. One source of income is derived from up-front licensing fees as is the case with our manufacturing license agreement for the use of our patents and proprietary “know-how” for the manufacture of the ElectriPlast® pellets by PolyOne Corporation (“PolyOne”), a global polymer company and Hanwha Advanced Materials Co., Ltd. (“Hanwha”) of Korea. In addition, Integral allocates resources to expand and protect the extensive intellectual property holdings surrounding its ElectriPlast® technology. Integral’s business strategy focuses on the leveraging of its intellectual property rights and our strength in product design and material innovation. Integral is focusing its business development and marketing efforts on securing licensing and/or joint development agreements in areas for which it currently hold patents covering specific materials, components, parts, applications or end-products incorporating conductive resins and ElectriPlast technology. Integral collaborates with suppliers, Tier1 vendors, OEM's and manufacturers of products who would benefit from the incorporation of any of the ElectriPlast® applications.
 
Our business model calls for the Company to generate revenue from license fees from the use of our patent portfolio and proprietary “know-how”, to generate revenue through the sale of ElectriPlast® material either through a royalty revenue stream or from direct sales of ElectriPlast®, and by providing technical services through our Detroit Tech Center to companies needing our expertise in applying ElectriPlast® in their applications. The Company’s management and engineering team has expertise and know-how in the ideas related to the use of the product.
 
Various examples of applications for ElectriPlast® where Integral holds patent protection are: batteries, antennas, electronics shielding, lighting/LED circuitry, motors, switch actuators, resistors, medical devices, thermal management, toys and cable connector bodies, among others. We have been working to introduce these new applications and the ElectriPlast® technology on a global scale.
 
In particular, our business model calls for collaborating with leading resin and fiber suppliers, manufacturers, and technology innovators to manufacture ElectriPlast®, and develop new product applications for ElectriPlast® . We anticipate that these relationships will lead to greater market penetration and adoption for our products. In view of these goals, we have recently formed relationships with BASF, Chang Rim Eng. Inc., Delphi Automotive PLC, Advanced Battery Concepts, The Ultimate Battery Co., LeddarTech, TheMix Plastics, Inc., PolyOne and Hanwha, and believe that we now have several key global relationships to help us expand our operations both domestically and internationally.

Since the previous 10-K filing, several actions were taken by the Company to better position the commercialization of ElectriPlast. The most notable event was the license agreement with PolyOne in February 20, 2018. The agreement is a 10-year, global exclusive license to manufacture, sell and distribute conductive pellets using the Company’s know-how and certain patents for automotive related EMI/RFI shielding applications. The agreement requires PolyOne to pay the Company an upfront fee and royalties from future sales during the term of the agreement. The agreement excludes the Company’s bipolar battery technology and the territory provided to Hanwha in an earlier agreement. The Company continues to emphasize the expansion of ElectriPlast's technical and engineering capabilities with other prospective customers and partners. The bipolar battery technology remains an important opportunity for the Company and the global vehicle electrification trend creates new opportunities that existing battery technologies are unable to meet. In 2015, the Company filed non-provisional patents associated with its bipolar battery technology and bipolar plate products. The Company believes the bipolar battery plate and associated power storage technology provides long-sought breakout weight savings and performance benefits for the lead-acid battery market. The Company intends to develop the power storage technology as an Integral Technologies business unit and will seek partners to fully develop batteries for consumer and industrial consumption. The world-wide market demand for lead-acid batteries was estimated to be $44.7B in 2014, and expected to grow to $58.6B by 2020 (a 5% CAGR). Contributing to this growth will be new battery requirements established by the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (“USABC”) for 12V and 48V batteries in support of new Start – Stop systems in micro hybrid vehicles and 48V systems in hybrid vehicles coming to market over the next decade. From 2025, vehicle electrification (Hybrid & Battery EV) is expected to grow from about 10% of total vehicles sold to completely replace internal combustion engine (ICE) technology by 2050. These trends are already having a significant impact in the automotive industry and the need for new battery technologies to support growing power demands.
 
The Company continues to advance its bipolar plate technology for the battery industry. A core component of the bipolar plate is the ElectriPlast pellet that enables the conductivity and moldability of the proprietary bipolar plate using a nonmetal plate. The Company is presently in discussions with several prospective investment partners in the US, UK and Asia regarding the sale of the battery plate technology and global manufacturing rights. Under the present discussions, the Company retains all rights to the ElectriPlast pellet and the prospective buyer of the bipolar technology is required to purchase pellets exclusively from the Company. The first prototype battery utilizing the ElectriPlast bipolar technology was produced in 2015. The battery was produced with the assistance of Advanced Battery Concepts (“ABC”). Based on the initial prototype and a series of discussion during the quarter, the Company announced on April 26, 2016 a Joint Technology Assessment Program with Advanced Battery Concepts, an industry leader in large format bi-polar battery design and manufacture. The Company continues its technical partnership with ABC and it remains a potential partner in commercializing the bipolar technology.
 
On June 26, 2017 the Company announced that it had been chosen by a global Tier 1 automotive supplier to provide its conductive plastic for an EMI shielding application in an automotive optical sensing system.  The ElectriPlast part will be going into a global automotive platform in approximately two million vehicles with production expected to start in 2018 for a major United States auto manufacturer. The program is expected to run for five years upon commencement.
 
On June 21, 2017 the Company announced that its ElectriPlast material had been chosen by a leading European electric luxury SUV maker for use in a high voltage connector. This electric SUV made its European debut in late 2017. The order will run through 2024 and marks ElectriPlast's first European automotive commercial order, and the second ElectriPlast order for use in an electric vehicle platform during the reporting period. The application was co-developed with a North American automotive Tier 1. 
 
In Asia, the Company is supporting Hanwha’s market development efforts targeting the automotive sector. The Company also is also working with Chang Rim Eng. Inc. (“Chang Rim”) as it continues its efforts to commercialize ElectriPlast® in South Korea. The Company announced on October 8, 2014 that Chang Rim had successfully completed its prototype phase for a motor casing targeting the domestic Asia automotive market. On August 20, 2015, the Company announced with Chang Rim the largest ElectriPlast order in the Company’s history. The Company continues to make progress in shielding in the electric vehicle market and is currently working with multiple Tier 1's in implementing their EMI shielding solutions for automotive applications. Two million electric vehicles were on the road globally in 2016 and that number is estimated to grow to 70 million by 2025.

In March 2015 the Company relocated its North American manufacturing from Jasper Rubber Products in Jasper, Indiana to the Nova Polymers facility in Evansville, Indiana to support its growing demand for ElectriPlast.  In addition to relocating the line, additional capacity was added by dedicating existing Nova fixed assets to the ElectriPlast process that increased capacity by ten times.  Nova was selected because they had the infrastructure to scale manufacturing capacity to meet the expected growth in customer volumes through 2020 and beyond. The recent licensing agreement with PolyOne accelerates and expands the Company’s ability to provide conductive plastic pellets to customers around the world. PolyOne is a fully integrated polymer manufacturing organization with major manufacturing plants located around the world. As a recognized global polymer supplier, PolyOne already meets the stringent manufacturing, quality control and financial requirements needed to be an automotive Tier 1 supplier, items which are essential since PolyOne will become the supplier for the Company’s existing projects with the automotive Tier 1’s, and all other future customers for ElectriPlast. With the Polyone licensing agreement, the Company plans to reduce its capabilities at the Nova facility.
 
The PolyOne license agreement not only enables PolyOne to manufacture conductive pellet using the Company’s proprietary know-how and patents, it also permits PolyOne to sell, market and distribute conductive pellets worldwide. The Company believes PolyOne’s much larger global sales force will be key in further accelerating the Company’s growth in the auto sector, while enabling the Company to focus on its key technical strengths, including applications development and a customer technical support.
 
Companies continue to incorporate ElectriPlast in their on-going product development evaluations. One of the Company’s customers, LeddarTech raised over $100 million during the period. A LeddarTech product includes ElectriPlast material to produce lens barrels in its latest release of its LeddarOne Sensing Module, a compact and low-cost lidar that provides valuable presence detection and distance measurement capabilities to a wide range of finished products, including systems for autonomous driving vehicles. A key reason for LeddarTech using ElectriPlast is due to the superior qualities of ElectriPlast in the key areas of weight-reduction, cost, and robustness in the demanding environments where LeddarTech products are used.
 
In December 2017, the Company met with several prospective European investor partners in Europe regarding the feasibility of establishing a bipolar battery R&D facility and manufacturing plant in the UK. Companies and organizations included a global chemical company, a luxury car manufacturer, a leading UK university specializing in advance battery development and manufacturing processes for industry, and representatives from a local government that were supportive of providing infrastructure and tax incentives for establishing a battery plant in their district. The Company continues these discussions.
 
In April 2017, ElectriPlast presented its bipolar plate technology for lead acid batteries to a leading lead acid battery manufacturer in Asia. ElectriPlast’s Vice President of Engineering presented the advanced lead acid battery technology and its numerous benefits, including performance, reduced size and weight compared to existing lead-acid batteries. The Asian battery company requested to purchase several bipolar batteries for their internal testing. During its next prototype production, the Company will produce a sufficient number of batteries to provide to the Asian battery company.
 
In January 2016, the Company and a Tier 1 partner reached a technical milestone when its wire shielding application currently under development obtained the highest shielding effectiveness to date. The Company believes the level of shielding effectiveness validates the commercial viability of the technology. The companies have completed subsequent trials and continue to work towards commercialization for an effective alternative in replacing the more-costly metal, braided shielding.
 
The Company entered into a term sheet dated April 19, 2015 with a low conductive plastics compounder (the “Compounder”) for the purpose of acquiring all the assets of the Compounder, with the Compounder remaining a separate entity. The Compounder is a niche supplier of low conductive plastics with an international customer base. The Company’s strategic interest in the Compounder is its equipment and expertise in low conductive material compounding, as well as its customer base. The term sheet contemplated that upon the closing, all sales and marketing would be performed by the Company, and the Compounder would become the sole manufacturer for the Company. In October 2015, the founder and majority shareholder of the Compounder died from an accident before the transaction could be completed. Following the founder’s death, the Company made product for the Compounder through a combination of using former employees of the Compounder as well as the Company’s own staff. The Company has since stopped making material for the Compounder and is exploring other manufacturing options regarding the manufacture of low conductive materials, including exiting this low margin, capital intensive business.

ElectriPlast®
 
We have researched and developed an innovative, electrically and thermally conductive resin-based material called “ElectriPlast®.” The ElectriPlast® polymer is a compounded formulation of resin-based materials that are conductively loaded, or doped, with a proprietary-controlled, balanced concentration of micron conductive materials, and then pelletized using our patented manufacturing process. The conductive loading or doping within this pellet is then homogenized using conventional molding techniques and conventional molding equipment. The end result is a product that can be molded into any of the infinite shapes and sizes associated with plastics, is non-corrosive, and can serve as an electrically conductive alternative material to metal.
 
ElectriPlast® is a patented non-corrosive, durable, conductive plastic pellet that replaces the metallic component currently used for shielding and conductive devices, thus creating applications never before possible and with a 40-60% weight reduction. ElectriPlast's® intellectual property rights and 55 issued patents, of which 51 of those patents not yet expired, and 10 pending applications cover both the material and its applications.
 
Various examples of applications for ElectriPlast® include antennas, EMI shielding, lighting circuitry, switch actuators, resistors, batteries, medical devices, thermal management and cable connector bodies, among many others. We have been working to introduce these new applications and the ElectriPlast® technology on a global scale.
 
The ElectriPlast® intellectual property (IP) portfolio is the centerpiece of Integral’s strategy to aggressively develop, protect, and market its innovations. Integral’s patent holdings encompass a broad range of ElectriPlast® developments which extend beyond the core technology to include key applications, and manufacturing processes
 
ElectriPlast® can be fabricated into virtually any shape or dimension using low-cost capital investment equipment, such as injection molding and extrusion versus high cost stamping methods. Its design flexibility, shorter development cycle and speed of manufacturing create a valuable market edge for customers.
 
PolyOne Corporation is Integral’s global manufacturing partner of its proprietary ElectriPlast® product line (www.polyone.com). Prior to the recent license agreement with PolyOne, Jasper Rubber Products, Inc. and Nova Polymers were its US manufacturing partners (“Jasper”) (www.jasperrubber.com), and Hanwha remains the Korean manufacture
 
PolyOne is a leading provider of specialized polymer materials, services, and solutions with operations in specialty polymer formulations, color and additive systems, polymer distribution and specialty vinyl resins.

Patents/Trademarks on Technologies

Our intellectual property portfolio consists of over fourteen years of accumulated research and design knowledge and trade secrets.  We have sought United States (“US”) patent protection for many of our ideas related to our ElectriPlast® technologies.  Currently, we have filed 117 non-provisional US patent applications, 55 of which have been issued as patents, with 51 of those issued patents not yet expired.  No assurances can be given that all patent applications will be approved; however, to the extent that patents are not granted, we will continue to attempt to commercialize these technologies without the protection of patents.  As patents are issued, we will have the exclusive right to use and license the design(s) described in each issued patent for the life of the patent in the US.
 
Of the 117 non-provisional applications filed that have not issued as patents, 9 are currently pending, and 53 are no longer pending.  Integral continues to pursue intellectual property protection through its patent and trademark portfolio while constantly evaluating its filings to judiciously apply resources to our most critical technologies.  Integral has filed 12 Canadian patent applications, 2 of which have issued, with 10 no longer being active.  Integral has filed an International patent application, which published on September 25, 2014, claiming features of the Company’s capsule.  The Company filed national stage applications based on this PCT on September 15, 2015 in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, China, Japan, South Korea, Europe, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, India, Thailand, Philippines, Singapore and Australia. On August 10, 2015, the Company also filed new US and PCT patent applications for a Bipolar Plate and Method of Making and Using Same   with a US publication date of November 3, 2016 and a PCT publication date of November 10, 2016.

Product Manufacturing and Distribution
 
Our manufacturing licensees PolyOne and Hanwha are currently operating at limited manufacturing capacity in producing the compounded product catalog and ElectriPlast pellets for domestic and international customers. As demand continues to grow these manufacturers have the resources and ability to scale to meet any new production requirements. As we grow, especially outside the automotive sector, we would consider expanding our licensing agreements with our existing partners and/or enter into additional licensing agreements with new manufacturing partners. We may also consider acquiring existing assets or an operating company to help meet new demand is specialized, niche markets. We maintain our relationship with Nova Polymers to manufacture ElectriPlast® in the event product cannot be supplied by PolyOne and Hanwha.

Integral Technologies, Inc.
 

Our previous work with Jasper and Nova has enabled us to advance our manufacturing and molding process of ElectriPlast® and allows us to transfer these know-how advances to PolyOne under the license agreement. Our expertise and past experiences with our conductive pellet will greatly enhance the relationship with PolyOne, who possesses industry leading manufacturing and logistics services, but is limited in the know-how, manufacture and the development of applications using conductive materials. Within the past four years, we relocated our existing manufacturing facility from the Jasper Rubber Products plant to Nova Polymers in early 2015.   In addition to relocating the line, additional capacity was added by dedicating existing Nova fixed assets to the ElectriPlast process which increased capacity by ten times.  The move to Nova made strategic sense at the time because of the added infrastructure they provided that was needed for scaling manufacturing capacity to meet the expected growth in customer volumes. During the past fiscal year, the Company was awarded several large projects that required even greater manufacturing scalability that only a company of PolyOne’s size, resources and global presence could provide.
 
In June 2013, we signed a 10-year agreement with Hanwha that grants Hanwha an exclusive right to sell, distribute and manufacture ElectriPlast® in South Korea. Additionally, Hanwha has acquired non-exclusive sales and distribution rights to ElectriPlast® in Japan, Taiwan and China. Hanwha is part of the Hanwha Group of companies that collectively form one of the largest conglomerates in South Korea, and is a global supplier in both automotive and consumer goods materials. PolyOne is aware of the existing license agreement with Hanwha and our agreement with PolyOne does not affect the Hanwha agreement.
 
As an engineered raw material, our technologies will not be sold directly to the general public, but rather to businesses and manufacturers of certain products who will incorporate our technologies as components in the design of their end-products. In addition to our current relationships, we are also exploring other opportunities for potential global partnerships in non-automotive industries, as well as other industries, including consumer electronics, cable and wire, and telecommunications.
 
Barriers to Entry into Market Segment
 
We have been working to introduce the ElectriPlast® technology as an alternative to metal for use as an electrically conductive material. Although gaining rapidly, little industry knowledge exists today regarding the science and use of conductive resins as an alternative material or how to apply the material to specific applications. As with any new technology, a prospective client must first become educated on the uses of the material, then investigate, test, trial and accept that the alternative material is an adequate, to superior cost-effective replacement option. Until there is greater knowledge and broader acceptance of ElectriPlast as a viable metal replacement technology, we will continue to experience prolonged selling cycles.
SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS
 
Our business model calls for collaborating with leading technology innovators to develop new product applications for ElectriPlast® and to license our intellectual property for its manufacture and commercialization across many industries. Below is a summary of each of our commercial agreements concerning our ElectriPlast® technology (Please note that we have not yet received significant revenues from these agreements unless otherwise noted)
