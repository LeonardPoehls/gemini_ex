Current Projects
 
We currently have the following real estate projects under development:
 
Beauport, QC
 
This project is a low density project in Beauport, a city in the suburbs of Quebec. The main roads are 2 km away from the project and all services, including a shopping center, restaurants, grocery store, clinic, primary school and high school etc. are less than 1 km away. The projects will consist of townhouses, semi-detached and standard houses whereby the Company plans to develop lots after conversion to residential zoning. Since the Company has experienced unexpected delays in zoning conversion, no significant development of this property occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
As of December 31, 2017, we have invested $5,069,324 (CAD 6,363,780) in the property.
 
Terrace, BC
 
Terrace is a city on the Skeena River in British Columbia, Canada. The Terrace region was a booming market in 2015 because of the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects underway. Companies invested hundreds of millions of dollars in advanced work in order to be prepared for LNG. We had decided to participate in this opportunity by buying lands on which we expect to build apartments as the Terrace region had a lack of available housing and a strong need to house their employees. Stemming from the significant decline in global oil and gas prices in 2016, many LNG projects across British Columbia were delayed or discontinued and as such, housing demands in this region also rapidly diminished. No significant development of these properties occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017, however, at the end of year 2017, new discussions about restarting the largest LNG project by the end of 2018 have risen and should the project be reactivated, thousands of domestic jobs could be created, combined with a boom in residential construction in both Kitimat and Terrace.
 
We currently own three properties in Terrace with a total cost to date of $1,719,526 (CAD 2,158,608).
 
Kitimat, BC
 
The Kitimat region was booming due to the LNG projects underway. Companies have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in advanced work in order to be prepared for the LNG projects. Accordingly, this region experienced a severe lack of infrastructure and single family dwellings needed to house their workers. Investments have been made into this region to help strengthen the local community and to create economic advantages for future generations of British Columbians. We incurred $50,000 of development costs on this property during the year ended December 31, 2015. Stemming from the significant decline in global oil and gas prices in 2016, many LNG projects across British Columbia were delayed or discontinued and as such, housing demands in this region also rapidly diminished. No significant development of these properties occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017, however, at the end of year 2017, new discussions about restarting the largest LNG project by the end of 2018 have risen and should the project be reactivated, thousands of domestic jobs could be created, combined with a boom in residential construction in both Kitimat and Terrace.
 
We acquired approximately 250,000 square feet of prime residential land development to build over 300 apartment units. To date, we have invested $1,795,147 (CAD 2,253,540) in the property in Kitimat.
 
Louisette, France
 
Louisette is located in Seyne sur Mer, Var, South of France. The land is less than 5 minutes from the Six-Fours beach, which is a region rich in tourism. We are co-investing on this project with Rome Finance Group and Capital Evolution Group SAS. As of December 31, 2017, we own 2% of the project through an investment in shares of Society Louisette Memories SARL.

Evans, Colorado
 
The town of Evans is located in Weld County, 60 miles from Denver, Colorado. Evans has a growing economy fueled by large oil & gas companies, investors and agriculture. The technology, aerospace, construction, financial and health care sectors are also prominent in Evans with continued hiring and job opportunities. Job creation, strong population growth and a continued influx of new residents and businesses to the area have led to an increased demand for housing in Evans. According to the Department of Labor, Weld County has seen the strongest job growth of any county in the U.S. from June 2013 to June 2014, the last period for which data is available. 
 
We acquired 220 acres (equivalent to 9,583,200 square feet of land) and 763 water rights in Evans. As of December 31, 2017, we have invested $6,717,876 in the property in Evans and have incurred an additional $2,518,008 in development costs. Beginning in 2018, ROI commenced its development of approximately 1,078 lots in approximately five phases. The project will entail developing the land infrastructure and obtaining necessary zoning for a mix of housing units, including single family homes, town homes, duplexes and condos. The Company also plans to develop lots for a community club house as well as commercial and retail areas. A new middle school was opened in fall of 2015 adjacent to the property and a new private hospital was constructed and opened in mid-2017, which are expected to further fuel demand for quality housing.
 
Sobha Hartland, Dubai, UAE
 
Sobha Hartland is a mixed-use development that is located in Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum City. It affords a full view of the Dubai skyline and it is conveniently located close to the metro, the water canal, in front of the Dubai Design District and only minutes from downtown via Al Khail artery road. This complete community offers high net worth residents of Dubai a chance to reduce their commuting drive from 20-25 km to 3 km or 5 minutes to downtown. Dubai is among the fastest growing cities in the world. It is a major financial center and business hub for the Middle East and Africa. Dubai’s economy is fueled by a number of industries including tourism, finance, industrial consulting and communication technologies.
 
We have partnered with Sobha LLC, a subsidiary of PNC Investments LLC (“PNC”), for this project. Sobha LLC is a large and fully integrated developer in the region having developed 450 projects in the Middle East and Europe. On February 7, 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary, ROI Land Investments FZ, entered into a Development Sale and Purchase Agreement with PNC for the purchase of approximately 433,000 square feet of land in Sobha Hartland. The total acquisition price is $29,488,000 (AED 108,281,250). This project features three, eight-story buildings for a total of 300 units. Each building offers Dubai residents with a variety of luxurious housing options including studio apartments, 1-bedroom apartments, 2-bedroom apartments, 3-bedroom apartments, two bedroom duplexes and three bedroom duplexes.
 
On May 15, 2016, the Company received a termination letter from PNC terminating the agreement dated February 7, 2016 for non-payment of the amounts due under the agreement. As a result, the Company forfeited the $4,701,205 (AED 17,271,099) of deposits. A total of $5,048,032 (AED 18,545,258), including $346,827 (AED 1,273,583) of closing and development costs, has been charged to operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 as abandoned project costs. However, the Company is still in negotiations with PNC to acquire a reduced size and price of the land it had agreed to under the agreement dated February 7, 2016 and apply the deposits to this restructured arrangement. Negotiations are under way, but the likelihood that the Company will be successful in reaching a satisfactory agreement is dependent on its ability to pay at least a portion of the new acquisition price. As a result, there can be no assurance that the acquisition will occur as contemplated or at all. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company also incurred $273,048 of other costs related to the project and wrote-off leasehold improvements related to a lease in Dubai for an amount of $299,475. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company did not incur any additional costs relating to this project.
 
Swarovski Towers, Dubai, UAE
 
On December 22, 2017, the Company entered into a Design & Licensing Agreement with Swarovski Brand License AG (“Swarovski”) which provides the Company with an exclusive license to design and to develop the Swarovski Towers building in the Dubai (United Arab Emirates) territory. The Company plans to develop the world’s first luxury hotel and residential property revealing the exceptional standards of high-quality design and decor of the Swarovski brand. The Company is currently in discussions with project partners to achieve its plans to launch the project by the end of year 2018.
