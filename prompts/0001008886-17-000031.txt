General
 
We are a provider of multiple full truckload transportation and logistics services, which generally involve the movement of full trailer or container loads of freight from origin to destination for a single customer.  We are one of North America's largest truckload transportation providers.  We provide significant capacity and a broad range of truckload and logistics services through our nationwide network of service centers, one of the country's largest truckload tractor fleets, and our contractual access to thousands of third-party capacity providers.  We have grown substantially by increasing the geographic reach of our service center network and by expanding the breadth of our services for customers. Historically, we have grown through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions, including through the creation of Kold Trans, LLC (“Kold Trans”), and the acquisition of Barr-Nunn Transportation, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (“Barr-Nunn”) in the fourth quarter of 2014, which has enhanced our business and service offerings with additional service centers and increased our driving associates, tractor fleet and capacity. Through our multiple service offerings, capabilities, and transportation modes, we are able to transport, or arrange for the transportation of, general commodities for our diversified customer base throughout the contiguous United States and parts of Canada and Mexico using state-of-the-art equipment, information technology, and qualified driving associates and non-driver employees.  We are committed to providing our customers with a wide range of truckload and logistics services and continue to invest considerable resources toward developing a range of solutions for our customers across multiple service offerings and transportation modes.  Our overall objective is to provide truckload and logistics services that, when combined, lead the industry for margin and growth, while providing efficient and cost-effective solutions for our customers.

We have two reportable segments: (i) Trucking and (ii) Logistics.  Financial information regarding these two segments is provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
 
Our Trucking segment is comprised of three operating units:  (i) dry van truckload ("Dry Van"), (ii) temperature-controlled truckload ("Refrigerated"), and (iii) drayage services ("Drayage").  We were founded as a provider of dry van truckload services, and in 2004, we took the first step towards our strategy of providing customers with a diversified range of truckload solutions with the creation of Knight Refrigerated, LLC, which provides our refrigerated services.  In 2008, we further enhanced our services by creating Knight Port Services, LLC, which provides drayage services between ocean ports, rail ramps, and shipping docks. In 2014, we grew our asset-based refrigerated offerings through Kold Trans, and we strengthened our dry van and expedited services through the acquisition of Barr-Nunn. We operate a large, modern tractor fleet supplemented with independent contractors to provide various asset-based solutions, including multiple stop pick-ups and deliveries, dedicated equipment and personnel, on-time expedited pick-ups and deliveries, specialized driver training, and other truckload services.
 
Our Logistics segment consists of two primary operating units:  (i) freight brokerage services ("Brokerage") and (ii) rail intermodal ("Intermodal"). We also provide logistics, freight management and other non-Trucking services to our customers through our Logistics business. In 2005, we established Knight Logistics, LLC (formerly known as Knight Brokerage, LLC), which develops contractual relationships with thousands of third-party capacity providers who provide their equipment and services to transport customer freight.  In 2010, we advanced our objective of growing our services with the addition of our Intermodal services.  Our Logistics offerings meet our customers' transportation needs by providing a diverse range of shipping alternatives from our network of third-party capacity providers and our rail providers. We believe that the diversified customer offerings of our Trucking and Logistics segments strategically position us for growth with existing and new truckload and logistics customers.
 
Our headquarters and service center support is located in Phoenix, Arizona.
 
Operations
 
 Our Trucking operating strategy is to gain truckload market share by leveraging our service offerings provided through our service center network, developing and enhancing customer relationships, and improving asset productivity through enhanced technology and market knowledge, while maintaining an extreme focus on cost.  To achieve these goals, we operate primarily in high-density, predictable freight lanes in select geographic regions and attempt to develop and expand our customer base around each of our service centers by providing multiple truckload services for our customers.  This operating strategy allows us to service the large amount of truckload freight transported in regional markets.  Our service centers enable us to better serve our customers and to work more closely with our driving associates.  We operate a modern fleet to appeal to drivers and customers, reduce maintenance expenses and downtime, and enhance our operating efficiencies.  We employ technology in both our Trucking and Logistics segments to assist us in controlling operating costs and enhancing revenue.  Our Logistics operating strategy is to match the shipping needs of our customers with the capacity provided by our network of third-party carriers and our rail providers.  Our goal is to increase our market presence, both in existing operating regions and in other areas where we believe the freight environment meets our operating strategy, while seeking to achieve industry-leading operating margins and returns on investment.
 
Our overall operating strategy includes the following important elements:
 
Regional Service Centers.  We believe that regional operations offer several advantages, including:
 

● | Obtaining greater freight volumes; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Achieving higher revenue per mile by focusing on high-density freight lanes to minimize non-revenue miles; 
● | Enhancing our ability to recruit and train high quality driving associates; 
● | Enhancing safety and driver development and retention; 
● | Enhancing our ability to provide a high level of service and consistent capacity to our customers; 
● | Enhancing accountability for performance and growth; and 
● | Furthering our Trucking and Logistics capabilities to provide various shipment solutions to our customers and to contract with more third-party capacity providers.

We operate primarily in the United States with minor operations in Canada and Mexico.  Substantially all of our revenue is generated from within the United States.  All of our tractors are domiciled in the United States, and for the past three years, we estimate that less than one percent of our revenue has been generated in Canada and Mexico.  We do not separately track domestic and foreign revenue from customers, and providing such information would not be meaningful.  All of our long-lived assets are, and have been for the last three fiscal years, located within the United States.
 
Operating Efficiencies.  We were founded on a philosophy of maintaining operating efficiencies and controlling costs.  We operate modern tractors and trailers in order to obtain operating efficiencies and attract and retain driving associates.  A generally compatible fleet of tractors and trailers simplifies our maintenance procedures and reduces parts, supplies, and maintenance costs.  We regulate vehicle speed in order to maximize fuel efficiency, reduce wear and tear, and enhance safety.  We continue to update our fleet with more fuel-efficient post-2014 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") emission compliant engines, install aerodynamic devices on our tractors, and equip our trailers with trailer blades, which have led to meaningful improvements in fuel efficiency.  Our Logistics segment focuses on effectively optimizing and meeting the transportation and logistics requirements of our customers and providing customers with various sources and modes of transportation capacity across our nationwide service network. We invest in technology that enhances our ability to optimize our freight opportunities while maintaining a low cost per transaction.
Customer Service.  We strive to provide superior, on-time service at a meaningful value to our customers and seek to establish ourselves as a preferred truckload and logistics provider for our customers.  We provide truckload capacity for customers in high-density lanes, where we can provide them with a high level of service, as well as flexible and customized logistics services on a nationwide basis.  Our Trucking services include Dry Van, Refrigerated, and Drayage, which also include dedicated truckload services, customized according to customer needs.  Our Logistics services include Brokerage, Intermodal, and certain logistics, freight management, and non-Trucking services, which provide various shipping alternatives and transportation modes for customers by utilizing our expansive network of third-party capacity providers and rail partners.  We price our Trucking and Logistics services commensurately with the level of service our customers require and market conditions.  By providing customers a high level of service, we believe we avoid competing solely based on price.
Using Technology that Enhances Our Business.  We purchase and deploy technology that we believe will allow us to operate more safely, securely, and efficiently.  All of our company-owned tractors are equipped with in-cab communication devices that enable us to communicate with our drivers, obtain load position updates, manage our fleets, and provide our customers with freight visibility, as well as with electronic logging devices that automatically record our drivers' hours-of-service.  The majority of our trailers are equipped with trailer-tracking technology that allows us to better manage our trailers.  We have purchased and developed software for our Logistics businesses that provides greater visibility of the capacity of our third-party providers and enhances our ability to provide our customers with solutions that offer a superior level of service.  We have automated many of our back-office functions, and we continue to invest in technology that allows us to better serve our customers and improve overall efficiency.
Growth Strategy
 
Our growth strategy is focused on the following key areas:
 
Strengthening our customer relationships.  We market our services to both existing and new customers who value our broad geographic coverage, various transportation and logistics services, and truckload capacity and freight lanes that complement our existing operations.  We seek customers who will diversify our freight base.  We market our Dry Van, Refrigerated, Drayage, Brokerage, and Intermodal services, including dedicated services within those offerings, to existing customers who may be in need of multiple services but do not currently take advantage of our array of truckload solutions.
 
Improving asset productivity.  We focus on improving the revenue generated from our tractors and trailers without compromising safety.  We anticipate that we can accomplish this objective through increased miles driven and an increased rate per mile.
 
Acquiring and growing opportunistically.  We regularly evaluate acquisition and other development and growth opportunities.  Since 1999, we have acquired five short-to-medium haul truckload carriers, including the acquisition of Barr-Nunn during 2014.  These acquisitions have involved the purchase of all outstanding stock, or the purchase of substantially all of the trucking assets, of such carriers.  We are actively looking for acquisition and other opportunities that could favorably contribute to Trucking and Logistics development and growth.
 
Expanding existing service centers.  Historically, a substantial portion of our revenue growth has been generated by our expansion into new geographic regions through the opening of additional service centers.  Although we continue to seek opportunities to further increase our business in this manner, our primary focus is on developing and expanding our existing service centers by strengthening our customer relationships, recruiting quality driving associates and non-driver employees, adding new customers, and expanding the range of transportation and logistics solutions offered from these service centers.

Diversifying our service offerings. We are committed to providing our customers a broad and growing range of truckload and logistics services and continue to invest considerable resources toward developing a range of solutions for our customers.  We believe that these offerings contribute meaningfully to our results and reflect our strategy to bring complementary services to our customers to assist them with their supply chain needs.  We plan to continue to leverage our nationwide footprint and expertise to add value to our customers through our diversified service offerings.
 
 We believe we have the service center network, systems capability, and management capacity to support substantial growth.  We have established a geographically diverse network that can support a substantial increase in freight volumes, organic or acquired.  Our network and business lines afford us the ability to provide multiple Trucking and Logistics solutions for our customers, and we maintain the flexibility within our network to adapt to freight market conditions.  We believe our unique mix of regional management, together with our consistent efforts to centralize certain business functions to achieve collective economies of scale, allow us to develop future company leaders with relevant operating and industry experience, minimize the potential diseconomies of scale that can come with growth in size, take advantage of regional knowledge concerning capacity and customer shipping needs, and manage our overall business with a high level of performance accountability.
 
Marketing and Customers
 
Our marketing mission is to be a strategic, efficient transportation capacity partner for our customers by providing truckload and logistics solutions customizable to the unique needs of our customers.  We deliver these capacity solutions through our network of owned assets, contracted independent contractors, third-party capacity providers, and our rail providers.  The diverse and premium services we offer provide a comprehensive approach to providing ample supply chain solutions to our customers. 
 
 Our Trucking and Logistics sales and marketing leaders are members of our senior management team, who are assisted by other sales professionals in each segment.  Our sales team emphasizes our industry-leading service, superior safety record, environmental leadership, and our ability to accommodate a variety of customer needs, provide consistent capacity, and financial strength and stability.
 
 We strive to maintain a diversified customer base.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top 25 customers among our Trucking and Logistics segments represented approximately 46.5% of revenue; our top 10 customers represented approximately 30.3% of revenue; and our top 5 customers represented approximately 20.5% of revenue.  No single customer represented more than 6.5% of revenue in 2016.
 
To be responsive to the needs of our customers and driving associates, we offer dedicated truckload services under our Trucking segment, in which we assign particular drivers and revenue equipment to prescribed routes.  This provides individual customers with a guaranteed source of capacity, and allows our driving associates to have more predictable schedules and routes.  Our dedicated tractor fleet services may provide a significant part of a customer's transportation requirements.  Under our dedicated transportation services, we provide drivers, equipment, maintenance, and, in some instances, transportation management services that supplement the customer's in-house transportation department.
 
Each of our service centers is linked to our corporate information technology system in our Phoenix headquarters.  The capabilities of this system and its software enhance our operating efficiency by providing cost-effective access to detailed information concerning equipment location and availability, shipment tracking and on-time delivery status, and other specific customer requirements.  The system also enables us to respond promptly and accurately to customer requests and assists us in matching available equipment with customer loads geographically.  Additionally, our customers can track shipments and obtain copies of shipping documents via our website.  We also provide electronic data interchange services to customers desiring these services.

Drivers, Other Employees, and Independent Contractors
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 5,971 total employees, of which 4,738 were company drivers.  None of our employees are subject to a union contract or other collective bargaining unit.
 
Our operating model creates an environment where our employees are able to learn the many aspects of truckload transportation and logistics and demonstrate their talents, entrepreneurial spirit, and commitment.  We believe that the depth of our employee talent within our service center network is one of our competitive advantages.  Our front-line employees bring a high level of commitment to our customers and driving associates, while leveraging the substantial resource of our national network.
 
We recognize that the recruitment, training, and retention of a professional driver workforce, which is one of our most valuable assets, are essential to our continued growth and meeting the service requirements of our customers.  We hire qualified drivers who hold a valid commercial driver's license, satisfy applicable federal and state safety performance and measurement requirements, and meet our objective guidelines relating primarily to their safety history, road test evaluations, and other personal evaluations, including mandatory drug and alcohol testing.  In order to attract and retain safe drivers who are committed to the highest levels of customer service and safety, we focus our operations for drivers around a collaborative and supportive team environment.  We provide late model and comfortable equipment, direct communication with senior management, competitive wages and benefits, and other incentives designed to encourage driver safety, retention, and long-term employment.  We also recognize our drivers for providing superior service and developing good safety records.  Our drivers are compensated on a per mile basis, based on the length of haul and a predetermined number of miles.  Drivers are also compensated for additional flexible services provided to our customers.  Our drivers and other employees are invited to participate in our 401(k) program, and company-sponsored health, life, and dental plans.  We believe these factors help us in attracting, recruiting, and retaining professional drivers in a competitive driver market.
 
Through Squire Transportation, LLC ("Squire"), our trucking training company, we focus on developing skilled, productive, and safe qualified drivers.  Squire's mission is to provide our drivers with the skills necessary to have a safe driving career with us.  We believe Squire will continue to be very beneficial for recruiting and retaining qualified drivers.
 
 We also maintain an independent contractor program.  Because independent contractors provide their own tractors and drivers and are responsible for their own operating expenses, the independent contractor program provides us with an alternate method of obtaining additional truckload capacity.  We intend to continue our use of independent contractors, but competition for independent contractors is intense.  As of December 31, 2016, we had 448 contracts with independent contractors.  Independent contractors contract with us to provide the tractor and driver to service the load offered to them.  We pay independent contractors a fixed rate and a fuel protection based on a predetermined number of loaded and empty miles, fuel prices, and other factors.  We offer tractor maintenance services to our independent contractors, although they are financially responsible for the costs and pay for their own fuel.  We provide trailers for each independent contractor.  In certain instances, we provide financing to independent contractors to assist them to purchase revenue equipment.  As of December 31, 2016, outstanding loans to independent contractors totaled in the aggregate approximately $1.0 million.
 
Revenue Equipment
 
In 2016, we operated an average of 4,286 company-owned tractors with an average age of 1.9 years.  We also had under contract 448 tractors owned and operated by independent contractors as of December 31, 2016.  We also operated an average of 12,288 trailers in 2016.  Growth of our tractor and trailer fleet is determined by market conditions and our experience and expectations regarding equipment utilization.  In acquiring revenue equipment, we consider a number of factors, including economy, price, rate, economic environment, technology, warranty terms, manufacturer support, driver comfort, and resale value.  We maintain strong relationships with our equipment vendors and the financial flexibility to react as market conditions dictate.
 
We have adopted an equipment configuration that meets a wide variety of customer needs and facilitates customer requirements.  We adhere to a comprehensive maintenance program that minimizes downtime and enhances the resale value of our equipment.  We perform routine servicing and maintenance of our equipment at most of our service centers, and we routinely inspect our equipment and that of our independent contractors to determine and monitor compliance with the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”) requirements.  Our current policy is to replace our tractors between 48 months and 60 months after purchase and to replace our trailers over a five- to ten-year period. Changes in the current market for used tractors and trailers, regulatory changes, and difficult market conditions faced by tractor and trailer manufacturers, may result in price increases that may affect the period of time for which we operate our equipment.

Safety and Risk Management
 
We are committed to safe and secure operations. We conduct a mandatory intensive driver qualification process, including defensive driving training for all driving associates, which includes our company drivers, independent contractors, and trainees.  We regularly communicate with driving associates to promote safety and instill safe work habits through effective use of various media and safety review sessions. We also regularly conduct safety training for our drivers, independent contractors, and non-driving personnel.  We dedicate personnel and resources to ensure safe operation and regulatory compliance.  We employ safety personnel whose primary responsibility is the administration of our safety programs.  We employ technology to assist us in managing risks associated with our business.  In addition, we have an innovative recognition program for driver safety performance and emphasize safety through our equipment specifications and maintenance programs. Our Corporate Directors of Safety review all accidents and report weekly to the Senior Director of Safety and Risk Management.
 
We require prospective drivers to meet higher qualification standards than those required by the DOT. The DOT requires drivers to obtain commercial drivers' licenses and requires that we perform drug and alcohol testing that meets DOT regulations. Our program includes pre-employment, random, and post-accident drug testing and all other testing required by the DOT as well as additional Company required testing. We are authorized by the DOT to haul hazardous materials. We require any driver who transports hazardous materials to have the proper endorsement and to be regularly trained as prescribed by DOT regulations.
 
The primary claims arising in our business consist of auto liability, including personal injury, property damage, physical damage, and cargo loss. We are insured against auto liability claims under a self-insured retention ("SIR") policy.  For the policy periods from March 1, 2015 to March 1, 2016, and from March 1, 2016 to March 1, 2017, our SIR is $2.5 million with no additional responsibility for "aggregate" losses.  We regularly review insurance limits and retentions. We have secured excess liability coverage up to $130.0 million per occurrence.  We also carry a $2.5 million aggregate deductible for any loss or losses that rise to the excess coverage layer.
 
We are self-insured for workers' compensation claims up to a maximum limit of $1.0 million per occurrence.  We also maintain primary and excess coverage for employee medical expenses and hospitalization, with self-insured retention of $225,000 per claimant for 2015, $240,000 per claimant for 2016 and 2017.
 
Competition
 
The freight transportation industry is highly competitive and fragmented.  We compete primarily with other truckload carriers and logistics companies, as well as railroads and airfreight providers.  Our Trucking segment competes with other motor carriers for the services of drivers, independent contractors, and management employees.  Our Logistics segment competes with other logistics companies for the services of third-party capacity providers and management employees.  A number of our competitors have greater financial resources, own more revenue equipment, and carry a larger volume of freight than we do.  We believe that the principal differentiating factors in our business, relative to competition, are service, efficiency, pricing, the availability and configuration of equipment that satisfies customers' needs, and our ability to provide multiple transportation solutions to our customers.
 
The freight environment was more challenging in 2016 compared to 2015 and modestly improved as the year progressed.  We attribute the change to excess trucking capacity in the markets we serve, and fewer non-contract opportunities that pressured our revenue per loaded mile. However, we sustained improvement in our asset utilization and experienced more favorable freight conditions toward the end of the year. In this environment, we diligently focused our efforts on cost control and continued to seek operational efficiencies while providing industry-leading service.
 
Regulation
 
Our operations are regulated and licensed by various government agencies, including the DOT, EPA, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ("DHS").  These and other federal and state agencies also regulate our equipment, operations, drivers, and third-party capacity providers.  We currently have, and have always maintained, a satisfactory DOT safety rating, which is the highest available rating, and we take continuous efforts to maintain our satisfactory rating.
 
The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (the “FMCSA”), imposes safety and fitness regulations on us and our drivers, including rules that restrict driver hours-of-service.  In December 2011, the FMCSA published its 2011 Hours-of-Service Final Rule (the “2011 Rule”).  The 2011 Rule requires drivers to take 30-minute breaks after eight hours of consecutive driving and reduces the total number of hours a driver is permitted to work during each week from 82 hours to 70 hours.  The 2011 Rule provides that the 34-hour restart may only be used once per week and must include two rest periods between one a.m. and five a.m. (together, the “2011 Restart Restrictions”).  These rule changes became effective in July 2013.
 

9
 


In December 2014, the 2015 Omnibus Appropriations bill was signed into law.  Among other things, the legislation provided temporary relief from the 2011 Restart Restrictions while the FMCSA conducted a study to determine whether such restrictions had a positive result on driver safety (the “Study”), and essentially reverted to the more straightforward 34-hour restart rule that was in effect before the 2011 Rule became effective.  In December 2016, a short-term funding bill was signed into law that directly ties the reinstatement of the 2011 Restart Restrictions to the outcome of the Study, and requires the Study to demonstrate that the 2011 Restart Restrictions offer a “statistically significant improvement” in safety related matters in order for the 2011 Restart Restrictions to be reinstated.
 
 There are two methods of evaluating the safety and fitness of carriers.  The first method is the application of a safety rating that is based on an onsite investigation and affects a carrier’s ability to operate in interstate commerce. We currently have a satisfactory DOT safety rating under this method, which is the highest available rating under the current safety rating scale.  If we were to receive a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could adversely affect our business, as some of our existing customer contracts require a satisfactory DOT safety rating.  In January 2016, the FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking outlining a revised safety rating measurement system, which would replace the current methodology.  Under the proposed rule, the current three safety ratings of “satisfactory,” “conditional,” and “unsatisfactory” would be replaced with a single safety rating of “unfit,” and a carrier would be deemed fit when no rating was assigned.  Moreover, the proposed rules would use roadside inspection data, in addition to investigations and onsite reviews to determine a carrier’s safety fitness on a monthly basis.  Under the current rules, a safety rating can only be given upon completion of a comprehensive onsite audit or review.  The proposed rule underwent a public comment period that ended in June 2016 and several industry groups and lawmakers expressed their disagreement with the proposed rule, arguing that it violates the requirements of the FAST Act and that the FMCSA must first finalize its review of the CSA scoring system, described in further detail below. Based on this feedback, in January 2017, the FMCSA determined that a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking outlining certain changes to the proposed rule would be released in the future. Therefore, it is uncertain if, when, or under what form this proposed rule could take effect. However, if this rule or a similar rule was adopted, and we were to receive a rating of "unfit," it could materially adversely affect our operations.
 
In addition to the safety rating system, the FMCSA has adopted the Compliance Safety Accountability program (“CSA”) as an additional safety enforcement and compliance model that evaluates and ranks fleets on certain safety-related standards. The CSA program analyzes data from roadside inspections, moving violations, crash reports from the last two years, and investigation results. The data is organized into seven categories.  Carriers are grouped by category with other carriers that have a similar number of safety events (e.g., crashes, inspections, or violations) and carriers are ranked and assigned a rating percentile to prioritize them for interventions if they are above a certain threshold.  Currently, these scores do not have a direct impact on a carrier’s safety rating.  However, the occurrence of unfavorable scores in one or more categories may (i) affect driver recruiting and retention by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment with other carriers, (ii) cause our customers to direct their business away from the us and to carriers with higher fleet safety rankings, (iii) subject us to an increase in compliance reviews and roadside inspections, or (iv)  cause us to incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve unfavorable scores, any of which could adversely affect the our results of operations and profitability.
 
Under CSA, these scores were initially made available to the public in five of the seven categories.  However, pursuant to the FAST Act, which was signed into law in December 2015, the FMCSA is required to remove from public view the previously available CSA scores while it reviews the reliability of the scoring system.  During this period of review by the FMCSA, we will continue to have access to our own scores and will still be subject to intervention by the FMCSA when such scores are above the intervention thresholds.
 
In 2011, the FMCSA issued new rules that would require nearly all carriers, including us, to install and use electronic on-board recording devices (“EOBRs,” now referred to as electronic logging devices, or “ELDs”) in their tractors to electronically monitor truck miles and enforce hours-of-service.  These rules, however, were vacated by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in August 2011. In response, Congress passed legislation in July 2012 renewing the mandate, subject to new regulations to be promulgated by the DOT. Pursuant to its rulemaking authority, the FMCSA published a new final rule in December 2015 which requires the use of ELDs by nearly all carriers by December 2017 (the "2015 ELD Rule"). We have proactively installed ELDs on 100% of our tractor fleet, so we don’t believe the 2015 ELD Rule will impact our operations or profitability or our use of ELDs. Furthermore, we believe that more effective hours-of-service enforcement after the 2015 ELD Rule takes effect may improve our competitive position by causing all carriers to adhere more closely to hours-of-service requirements.
 

10
 


In November 2015, the FMCSA published its final rule related to driver coercion, which took effect in January 2016.  Under this rule, carriers, shippers, receivers, or transportation intermediaries that are found to have coerced drivers to violate certain FMCSA regulations (including hours-of-service rules) may be fined up to $16,000 for each offense.
 
In December 2016, the FMCSA issued a final rule establishing a national clearinghouse for drug and alcohol testing results and requires motor carriers and medical review officers to provide records of violations by commercial drivers of FMCSA drug and alcohol testing requirements.  Motor Carriers will be required to query the clearinghouse to ensure drivers and driver applicants do not have unresolved violations of federal drug and alcohol testing regulations.
 
 Other rules have been recently proposed or made final by the FMCSA, including (i) a rule requiring the use of speed limiting devices on heavy duty trucks to restrict maximum speeds, which was proposed in 2016 but has not yet been made final, and (ii) a rule setting forth minimum driver-training standards for new drivers applying for commercial driver licenses for the first time and to experienced drivers upgrading their licenses or seeking a hazmat endorsement, which was made final in December 2016, with a compliance date in February 2020. The effect of these rules could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could adversely affect our business or operations.
 
Tax and other regulatory authorities have in the past sought to assert that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors.  Federal legislators continue to introduce legislation concerning the classification of independent contractors as employees, including legislation that proposes to increase the tax and labor penalties against employers who intentionally or unintentionally misclassify employees as independent contractors and are found to have violated employees' overtime or wage requirements.  Additionally, federal legislators have sought to (i) abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice, (ii) extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to independent contractors, and (iii) impose notice requirements based upon employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply.  Some states have adopted initiatives to increase their revenues from items such as unemployment, workers' compensation, and income taxes, and we believe a reclassification of independent contractor drivers as employees would help states with this initiative.  Federal and state taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status.  If our independent contractors were determined to be our employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, which could potentially include prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.  We currently observe and monitor our compliance with current related and applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot predict whether laws and regulations adopted in the future regarding the classification of our independent contractor drivers will adversely affect our business or operations.


In May 2010, an executive memorandum was executed directing the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA") and EPA to develop new, stricter fuel efficiency standards for heavy tractors.  In August 2011, the NHTSA and EPA adopted a new rule that established the first-ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, which include tractor-trailers (the “Phase 1 Standards”).  The Phase 1 Standards apply to tractor model years 2014 to 2018 and require the achievement of an approximate 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption by the 2018 model year, which equates to approximately four gallons of fuel for every 100 miles traveled.  In addition, in February 2014, President Obama announced that his administration would begin developing the next phase of tighter fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards for medium-and heavy-duty trucks and trailers (the “Phase 2 Standards”).  In October 2016, the EPA and NHTSA published the final rule mandating that the Phase 2 Standards will apply to trailers beginning with model year 2018 and tractors beginning with model year 2021.  The Phase 2 Standards require nine percent and 25 percent reductions in emissions and fuel consumption for trailers and tractors, respectively, by 2027.  We believe these requirements will result in additional increases in new tractor and trailer prices and additional parts and maintenance costs incurred to retrofit our tractors and trailers with technology to achieve compliance with such standards, which could adversely affect our operating results and profitability, particularly if such costs are not offset by potential fuel savings. We cannot predict, however, the extent to which our operations and productivity will be impacted.
 
The California Air Resources Board ("CARB") also adopted emission control regulations that will apply to all heavy-duty tractors that pull 53-foot or longer box-type trailers within the State of California.  The tractors and trailers subject to these CARB regulations must be either EPA SmartWay certified or equipped with low-rolling resistance tires and retrofitted with SmartWay-approved aerodynamic technologies.  Enforcement of these CARB regulations for 2011 model year equipment began in January 2010 and will be phased in over several years for older equipment.  In order to comply with the CARB regulations, we submitted a large fleet compliance plan to CARB in June 2010.  In addition, in February 2017 CARB proposed California Phase 2 standards that generally align with the federal Phase 2 Standards, with some minor additional requirements, and as proposed would stay in place even if the federal Phase 2 Standards are affected by action from the Trump administration.  We will continue monitoring our compliance with the CARB regulations.  Federal and state lawmakers also have proposed potential limits on carbon emissions under a variety of climate-change proposals.  Compliance with such regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors, may increase the cost of any new trailers that will operate in California, may require us to retrofit certain of our pre-2011 model year trailers that operate in California, and could impair equipment productivity and increase our operating expenses.  These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values of these vehicles, could materially increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations.

In order to reduce exhaust emissions, some states and municipalities have begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors may idle.  These restrictions could force us to purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or to alter our drivers' behavior, which could result in a decrease in productivity, or increase in driver turnover.
 
In April 2016, the Food and Drug Administration published a final rule establishing requirements for shippers, loaders, carriers by motor vehicle and rail vehicle, and receivers engaged in the transportation of food, to use sanitary transportation practices to ensure the safety of the food they transport as part of the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 (the "FSMA").  This rule sets forth requirements related to (i) the design and maintenance of equipment used to transport food, (ii) the measures taken during food transportation to ensure food safety, (iii) the training of carrier personnel in sanitary food transportation practices, and (iv) maintenance and retention of records of written procedures, agreements, and training related to the foregoing items.  These requirements will take effect for larger carriers such as us in April 2017 and are applicable when we perform as a carrier or as a broker.  We believe that our current food shipping practices generally align with the carrier requirements under the rules and the company will be fully compliant with the rules prior to April 2017. If we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations related to the FSMA, we could be subject to substantial fines, penalties and/or criminal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
In addition to the foregoing laws and regulations, our operations are subject to other federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, many of which are implemented by the EPA and similar state agencies.  Such laws and regulations generally govern the management and handling of hazardous materials, discharge of pollutants into the air, surface water and groundwater preservation, and disposal of certain various substances.  We do not believe that our compliance with these statutory and regulatory measures have had a material adverse effect on our operating results, capital expenditures, or business and operations.
 
The regulatory environment has recently changed under the administration of President Trump.  In January 2017, the President’s office issued a temporary moratorium on proposed and recently published regulations, which will delay the effectiveness of such regulations for at least 60 days.  Additionally, in January 2017, the President signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to repeal two regulations for each new one they propose and imposing a regulatory budget, which would limit the amount of new regulatory costs federal agencies can impose on individuals and businesses each year.  The impact of these actions by the Trump administration may inhibit future new regulations and/or lead to the repeal or delayed effectiveness of existing regulations. Therefore, it is uncertain how we may be impacted in the future by existing or proposed regulations.

Seasonality
 
In the transportation industry, results of operations generally follow a seasonal pattern.  Freight volumes in the first quarter are typically lower due to less consumer demand, customers reducing shipments following the holiday season, and inclement weather impeding operations. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase, and the tractor productivity of our fleet, independent contractors, and third-party carriers decreases during the winter months because of decreased fuel efficiency, increased cold weather-related equipment maintenance and repairs, and increased insurance claims and costs attributed to higher accident frequency from harsh weather.  During this period, the profitability of our Trucking operations is generally lower than during other parts of the year. Additionally, we have seen surges between Thanksgiving and Christmas resulting from holiday shopping trends toward delivery of gifts purchased over the internet, as well as the impact of shorter holiday seasons.
Acquisitions, Investments, and Dispositions
 
We regularly examine investment opportunities in areas related to our businesses.  Our investment strategy is to invest in businesses that will strengthen our overall position in the transportation industry, minimize our exposure to start-up risk, and provide us with an opportunity to realize a substantial return on our investment.  Since 1999, we have acquired all of the outstanding stock of five short-to-medium haul truckload carriers, or have acquired substantially all of the trucking assets of such carriers, including: (i) Granger, Iowa-based Barr-Nunn, acquired in 2014; (ii) Phoenix, Arizona-based Roads West Transportation, Inc., acquired in 2006; (iii) Idaho Falls, Idaho-based Edwards Bros., Inc., acquired in 2005; (iv) Gulfport, Mississippi-based John Fayard Fast Freight, Inc., acquired in 2000; and (v) Corsicana, Texas-based Action Delivery Service, Inc., acquired in 1999.  We have not conducted any acquisitions through our Logistics segment.  Although most of our growth has been internal, we continue to evaluate acquisition and other opportunities that contribute to Trucking and Logistics development and growth.

In 2003, we signed a partnership agreement with Transportation Resource Partners, LP (“TRP”), a company that makes privately negotiated equity investments.  Pursuant to the original partnership agreement, we committed to invest $5.0 million out of approximately $260.0 million total, for a 1.9% ownership interest. In early 2006, we increased the commitment amount to $5.5 million.  Contributions to TRP are accounted for using the cost method as our level of influence over the operations of TRP is minor, and no contributions have been made to TRP since 2011.  We did not record any gains or distributions in 2016, while we recorded gains from distributions totaling $208,000 in 2015. In 2014, we received distributions of $2.1 million of which $0.5 million was a return of capital, and $1.6 million was recorded as a gain. The gains are recognized in the year distributions are received. We also recorded impairment of $86,000, $177,000, and $1.0 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, for other-than-temporary loss on the investments remaining within the TRP portfolio. Our ownership interest in TRP is approximately 2.3%, with a carrying value of $214,000 and $300,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
In 2008, we committed to invest $15.0 million in a new partnership managed and operated by the managers and principals of TRP. The new partnership, Transportation Resource Partners III, LP (“TRP III”), focuses on the same investment opportunities as TRP. In 2015, based on an analysis of expected future fund activity, TRP III released investors from a portion of their outstanding commitment. Our share of the commitment release was $2.1 million. As of December 31, 2016, we have contributed approximately $11.1 million to TRP III, leaving an outstanding commitment of $1.8 million. The investment in TRP III is accounted for using the equity method. We have recorded income of approximately $533,000, $422,000, and $6.1 million for our investment in TRP III for years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In 2016, we received distributions totaling $496,000 from TRP III for the sale of TRP III portfolio companies. At December 31, 2016, the investment balance in TRP III was $5.9 million, compared to $5.8 million at December 31, 2015.  Our ownership interest was approximately 6.1% as at December 31, 2016.
 
In 2015, we committed to invest in another TRP partnership, TRP Capital Partners, LP (“TRP IV”). TRP IV is managed and operated by the managers and principals of TRP and TRP III, and is focused on similar investment opportunities. We committed to invest a total of $4.9 million to TRP IV, out of approximately $116.1 million total, for a 4.2% ownership interest and have contributed approximately $2.0 million, leaving an outstanding commitment of approximately $2.9 million as of December 31, 2016. Contributions to TRP IV are accounted for using the cost method. No gains or distributions were recorded during 2016.
 
In the first quarter of 2016, we committed to invest in another TRP partnership, TRP CoInvest Partners, (NTI) I, LP (“TRP Coinvestment”). The new partnership is managed and operated by the managers and principals of the other TRP partnerships, and is focused on similar investment opportunities. We committed to contribute, and have paid a total of, $10.0 million to the new partnership, leaving no outstanding commitment as of December 31, 2016. The investment in TRP Coinvestment is accounted for using the equity method, and the carrying value at December 31, 2016 was $10.0 million.
 
In the third quarter of 2016, we committed to invest in another TRP partnership, TRP CoInvest Partners, (QLS) I, LP (“TRP Coinvestment QLS”). The new partnership is managed and operated by the managers and principals of the other TRP partnerships, and is focused on similar investment opportunities. We committed to contribute, and have paid a total of, $9.7 million to the new partnership, leaving no outstanding commitment as of December 31, 2016. The investment in TRP Coinvestment QLS is accounted for using the equity method, and the carrying value at December 31, 2016 was $9.7 million.
 
In 2010, we partnered with an unrelated investor for the purpose of sourcing commercial vehicle parts. We contributed $26,000 to acquire 52% ownership of this entity. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810-10-15-8, Consolidation, we consolidate the financial activities of this entity into the condensed consolidated financial statements. The noncontrolling interest for this entity is presented as a separate component of the consolidated financial statements.
 
In 2014, we formed Kold Trans (formerly Kool Trans, LLC) for the purpose of expanding our refrigerated trucking business. We are entitled to 80% of the profits of the entity and have effective control over the management of the entity. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810-10-15-8, Consolidation, we consolidate the financial activities of this entity into the consolidated financial statements. The noncontrolling interest for this entity is presented as a separate component of the consolidated financial statements.

We also invest in marketable equity and debt securities, which are stated at fair value and are included in the "Other long-term assets and restricted cash and other investments" item of the consolidated balance sheets.  During 2016, we disposed of our holdings in available-for-sale equity investments leaving no balance on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. Our trading debt securities balance was approximately $1.9 million at December 31, 2016.
