ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Pandora—Internet Radio Service
Pandora is the world’s most powerful music discovery platform, offering a personalized experience for each of our listeners wherever and whenever they want to listen to music—whether through earbuds, car speakers or live on stage. Our vision is to be the definitive source of music discovery and enjoyment for billions. Pandora is available as an ad-supported service or as a subscription service, which we call Pandora Plus. The majority of our listener hours occur on mobile devices, with the majority of our revenue generated from advertising on our ad-supported service on these devices. We offer both local and national advertisers the opportunity to deliver targeted messages to our listeners using a combination of audio, display and video advertisements. We also generate revenue from subscriptions to Pandora Plus. Founded by musicians, Pandora also empowers artists with valuable data and tools to help grow their careers and connect with their fans.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we streamed 21.96 billion hours of internet radio, and as of December 31, 2016, we had 81.0 million active users during the prior 30-day period. Since we first launched our ad-supported service in 2005, our listeners have created over 11 billion stations.
Unlike traditional radio stations that broadcast the same content at the same time to all of their listeners, we enable each of our listeners to create personalized stations. The Music Genome Project and our content programming algorithms power our ability to predict listener music preferences, play music content suited to the tastes of each individual listener and introduce listeners to music we think they will love. When a listener enters a single song, artist, comedian or genre to start a station—a process we call seeding—the Pandora service instantly generates a station that plays music we think that listener will enjoy. Based on listener reactions to the songs we pick, we further tailor the station to match the listener's preferences. Listeners also have the ability to add variety to and rename stations, which further allows for the personalization of our service.
We currently provide the Pandora service through two models and have announced an additional service model to be launched in 2017:

• | Ad-Supported Service. Our ad-supported service allows listeners to access our music and comedy catalogs and personalized playlist generating system for free across all of our delivery platforms. Beginning on September 15, 2016, our ad-supported service includes new features, such as the ability to obtain more skips and replay tracks by watching an advertisement.


• | Subscription Service—Pandora Plus. Our new subscription service, Pandora Plus, launched in the United States on September 15, 2016. Prior to the launch of Pandora Plus, we operated a subscription service called Pandora One. Pandora Plus and Pandora One are premium monthly or annual paid versions of the Pandora service, which include ad-free access, higher quality audio on supported devices and longer timeout-free listening. Pandora Plus includes additional features, such as replays, additional skipping and offline listening.


• | Subscription Service—Pandora Premium. In December 2016, we unveiled our new on-demand music subscription service, Pandora Premium, which will launch to users in 2017. Pandora Premium will be a paid version of the Pandora service that will offer a unique, on-demand experience, providing users with the ability to search, play and collect songs and albums, build playlists on their own or with the tap of a button and automatically generate playlists based on the user’s listening activity.

Beyond song delivery, listeners can discover more about the music they hear by reading the history of their favorite artists, viewing artist photos and linking from Pandora to Amazon or iTunes to purchase and download albums and songs. Our service also incorporates community social networking features. Our music feed feature enables a real-time, centralized stream for listeners to view the music that their social connections are experiencing and to provide and receive recommendations for songs, albums and artists. Listeners can also share their stations through social media, messaging apps and email by using our share feature or by distributing our individualized station URLs.

Ticketing Service
We operate our ticketing service through our subsidiary Ticketfly, a leading live events technology company that provides ticketing and marketing software and services for our clients, which are venues and event promoters, across North America. Ticketfly's ticketing, digital marketing and analytics software helps promoters book talent, sell tickets and drive in-venue revenue, while Ticketfly's consumer tools help fans find and purchase tickets to events. Tickets are primarily sold through the Ticketfly platform but are also sold through other channels such as box offices. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Ticketfly provided ticketing services for approximately 115,000 live events on sale, for which approximately 15.2 million tickets, excluding box office sales, were sold to approximately 5.3 million unique ticket buyers, which resulted in more than $615.0 million in gross transaction value, excluding box office sales. 
Our Technologies
Pandora—Internet Radio Service
At the heart of our service is our set of proprietary personalization technologies, including the Music Genome Project and our playlist generating algorithms. When a listener enters a single song, artist, comedian or genre to start a station, the Pandora service instantly generates a station that plays music or comedy we think that listener will enjoy. Based on listener reactions to the recordings we pick, we further tailor the station to match the listener's preferences. Listeners also have the ability to add variety to and rename stations, which further allows for the personalization of our service.
Music Genome Project
The Music Genome Project is a database of over 1,000,000 uniquely analyzed songs from over 150,000 artists, spanning over 600 genres and sub-genres, which we develop one song at a time by evaluating and cataloging each song's particular attributes. Once we select music to become part of our catalog, our music analysts genotype the music by examining up to 450 attributes including objectively observable metrics such as tone and tempo, as well as subjective characteristics, such as lyrics, vocal texture and emotional intensity. We employ rigorous hiring and training standards for selecting our music analysts, who typically have four-year degrees in music theory, composition or performance, and we provide them with intensive training in the Music Genome Project's precise methodology.
Comedy Genome Project
Our Comedy Genome Project leverages similar technology to that underlying the Music Genome Project, allowing a listener to choose a favorite comedian or a genre as a seed to start a station and then give feedback to personalize that station. Our comedy collection includes content from more than 3,000 comedians with more than 35,000 tracks.
Our Other Core Innovations
In addition to the Music Genome Project, we have developed other proprietary technologies to improve delivery of the Pandora service, enhance the listener experience and expand our reach. Our other core innovations include:
Playlist Generating Algorithms. We have developed complex algorithms that determine which songs play and in what order on each personalized station. Developed since 2004, these algorithms combine the Music Genome Project with the individual and collective feedback we receive from our listeners in order to deliver a personalized listening experience.
Pandora User Experience. We have invested in ways to enable us to reach our audience anytime, anywhere that they enjoy radio. To this end, we have developed a number of innovative approaches, including our autocomplete station creation feature, which predicts and generates a list of the most likely musical starting points as a listener begins to enter a favorite station, song or artist. In 2016, we undertook a complete rebuild of the Pandora web interface, which included a redesign of our systems, graphics and functionality for the end user. 
Royalties Ingestion and Matching. We have developed a system to ingest ownership information from rightsholders and to match ingested ownership information with the tracks in our catalog for our ad-supported and subscription services. 
Pandora Mobile Streaming. We have designed a sophisticated system for streaming content to mobile devices. This system involves a combination of music coding programs that are optimized for mobile devices as well as algorithms designed to address the intricacies of reliable delivery over diverse mobile network technologies. For example, these algorithms are designed to maintain a continuous stream to a listener even in circumstances where the mobile data network may be unreliable. Our subscription service now includes predictive offline listening which detects when a mobile device has lost its signal and automatically transitions the listener to one of their top recent stations.

Pandora Automotive Protocol. We have developed an automotive protocol to facilitate increased availability of the Pandora service in automobiles. Through this automotive protocol, certain automobile manufacturers, their suppliers and makers of aftermarket audio systems can easily connect dash-mounted interface elements to the Pandora app running on a smartphone. This allows us to deliver the Pandora service to listeners via their existing smartphone, while leveraging the automobile itself for application command, display and control functionalities.
Pandora API. As part of our effort to make the Pandora service available everywhere our listeners want it, we have developed an application programming interface, which we call the Pandora API. Through our partnerships with manufacturers of consumer electronics products, we have used this technology to bring the Pandora experience to connected devices throughout the home.
tv.pandora.com. We have developed a standards-based HTML5 website called tv.pandora.com that allows users to stream music content on next generation TV, game consoles and set top box architectures that support open web standards. tv.pandora.com features streamlined navigation with controls and displays designed specifically for larger screens. 
Next Big Sound ("NBS")
NBS Platform. NBS is the leading provider of online music analytics and insights tracking hundreds of thousands of artists around the world. NBS was founded in 2009 and tracks social, streaming and video data in one centralized platform. Sources range from Facebook and Twitter to Wikipedia, YouTube, Vevo, Instagram and many others. The NBS platform complements Pandora's Artist Marketing Platform ("AMP") and expands the suite of data-driven products that Pandora offers music makers and direct deal partners.
Ticketing Service
Fully-Integrated Cloud Ticketing Platform. Ticketfly has developed a fully-integrated cloud ticketing platform for live events. The ticketing and marketing software powers the event lifecycle for venues and event promoters, including the booking of acts, the building and marketing of events and fan customer relationship management after the event.
Distribution and Partnerships
Pandora—Internet Radio Service
A key element of our strategy is to make the Pandora service available everywhere that there is internet connectivity. To this end, we make the Pandora service available through a variety of distribution channels. In addition to streaming our service to computers, we have developed Pandora mobile device applications ("apps") for smartphones and mobile operating systems, such as the iPhone and Android, and for tablets, including the iPad and Android tablets. We distribute those mobile apps free to listeners via app stores.
Pandora is integrated with connected devices, including automobiles, automotive aftermarket devices and consumer electronic devices. Currently, most automobile integrations rely on smartphones for internet connectivity, which has enabled Pandora to be available in the ten best-selling passenger vehicles in the United States. Some automobiles are now using embedded, built-in internet connectivity to power the Pandora experience. These native integrations, whether using embedded or phone-based connectivity, allow drivers to control the service via in-dash entertainment systems. As part of this ongoing effort to extend our reach in the car, we also built support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay into our mobile applications in 2015. While these platforms are still nascent, we expect these platforms will develop and grow significantly and help broaden our reach and provide consumers with additional flexibility for accessing Pandora in the car. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 24.9 million unique users have activated Pandora through a native integration in 27 major automobile brands and 8 automotive aftermarket manufacturers. We view the integration of the Pandora service into automobiles as an area of potential growth for the service, as a large portion of terrestrial radio listening occurs in automobiles.
Ticketing Service
Our ticketing services are available through multiple distribution channels, including the Ticketfly website, the websites of Ticketfly's venue and promoter clients, box offices, the Ticketfly mobile app and the Ticketfly website optimized for mobile devices. Tickets for events are delivered to fans through a variety of delivery methods, including mail, will call, print at home and mobile tickets, which are delivered electronically and presented by fans on their smartphones upon arrival to the venues. In 2016, we began the first stages of integrating Ticketfly into the Pandora mobile app. Listeners can now receive concert 
recommendations based on the listener's listening profile, concert reminders and purchase tickets to Ticketfly concerts, all from within the Pandora mobile app.
Ticketfly contracts with clients to sell tickets for events to fans over a set period of time, which generally ranges from three to five years. Ticketfly does not set ticket prices or seating configurations for events, as this information is determined by the client. Ticketfly generally is paid a fee per ticket sold, which usually increases as the face value of the ticket increases, or a percentage of the total ticket service charges. Ticketfly usually receives funds for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the ticket is sold and periodically remits these receipts to the client after deducting Ticketfly's portion of the fee. Clients also sell tickets through the box office at the venue using the Ticketfly technology. Ticketfly does not usually earn a fee on these box office ticket sales. 
Pandora Advertising Revenue
We derive the substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of audio, display and video advertising for delivery across our computer, mobile and other connected device platforms. We generate the majority of our revenue from mobile and other connected devices, which presents an opportunity for us to reach our audience anytime, anywhere that they enjoy music and therefore offer additional distribution channels to current and potential advertisers for delivery of their advertising messages.
Our advertising strategy focuses on developing our core suite of audio, display and video advertising products and marketing these products to advertisers for delivery across computer and mobile and other connected device platforms. Our advertising products allow both local and national advertisers to target and connect with listeners based on attributes including age, gender, zip code and content preferences using multi-platform ad campaigns to target their advertising messages to listeners anytime and anywhere. As listenership on our mobile platforms has grown more rapidly than on our other platforms, we have sought to improve our mobile advertising products to better enable us to market multi-platform advertising solutions. In the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, advertising revenue accounted for approximately 80%, 80% and 77% of our total revenue, respectively, and we expect that advertising will comprise a substantial majority of revenue for the foreseeable future.
Pandora Audio Advertising. Our audio advertising products allow custom audio messages to be delivered between music and comedy content during short ad interludes on our ad-supported service. Audio ads are available across all of our delivery platforms. On supported delivery platforms, the audio ads can be accompanied by display ads to further enhance advertisers' messages.
Pandora Display Advertising. Our display advertising products offer opportunities to maximize advertising exposure to listeners of our ad-supported service on computers and mobile platforms. The graphical interface for our services on these delivery platforms is divided between our tuner, which contains our player and "now playing" information, and the information space surrounding our tuner. Our display ads include industry-standard banner ads of various sizes and placements within the information space surrounding our tuner, depending on the delivery platform and listener interaction.
Pandora Video Advertising. Our video advertising products allow delivery of rich, branded messages to further engage listeners of our ad-supported service. We currently offer five video ad products, all of which offer full-screen video when activated. Some video ad products operate across our mobile and computer platforms, while others operate only on our mobile platform. All are designed to ensure they are viewable while playing, using interactions with Pandora to determine when a user is engaged with the screen. Some of our products play a full-screen video, and others go even further to offer a value exchange where opting into watching a video ad gives the listener benefits such as extra skips, song replays and even the ability to accept sponsorship by one advertiser in return for uninterrupted listening for a period of time.
Pandora Advertising Technologies. We have developed a suite of proprietary advertising technologies including order management, advertising serving and timing, native advertising formats, targeting and reporting. These technologies enable Pandora to streamline the quote to cash flow, maximize value for advertisers, simultaneously optimize yield and listener experience and personalize the advertising experience for listeners. 
Pandora Native Advertising. Our audio, display and video advertising products can be designed and modified by us and advertisers to tailor advertising campaigns to fit specific advertiser needs. Our advertisers can create custom "branded" stations from our music library that can be accessed by listeners of our ad-supported and subscription services, as well as engage listeners by allowing them to personalize the branded stations through listener-controlled variables. In addition to branded stations, we offer advertisers our sponsored listening product, in which advertisers sponsor ad-free listening for listeners of our 
ad-supported service in exchange for the listener’s active brand interaction, such as watching a video advertisement, interacting with rich media or visiting the advertiser's landing page.
Pandora Audience Targeting. Our audio, display, video and native advertising products have access to a set of over 2,000 targeting segments across all of our platforms, ranging from Pandora’s unique proprietary targeting segments to second- and third-party enabled segments. Examples include Pandora’s inferred Spanish Speakers and Political Preference proprietary segments, direct customer CRM upload and Datalogix and Neustar third-party segments. Additionally, advertisers can benefit from our proprietary ad targeting capabilities, which leverage listener-submitted profile information, enabling advertisers to precisely reach sought-after consumers without needing third-party cookies.
Pandora's advertising inventory is integrated into the leading radio media buying platforms, Mediaocean and STRATA, and we are continuing to enhance the ability of radio advertisers to purchase media on these platforms, which incorporate Triton measurements of our radio audience reach side-by-side with terrestrial radio metrics.
 We provide in-car advertising solutions, offering advertisers the opportunity to reach in-car audiences through audio ads running on vehicle models and aftermarket automotive devices with native Pandora automotive integrations. 
 In addition, we have invested in building a local advertising sales force in major radio markets. As of December 31, 2016, Pandora has 153 local sellers in 39 markets in the United States and we intend to continue investing to extend our local market presence for the foreseeable future.
We have introduced a programmatic advertising buying solution into the market primarily for national digital display and remnant performance advertising inventory. We intend to continue investing in our programmatic advertising buying solution in the future. 
Our integration into standard radio media-buying processes and measurement, our in-car advertising solutions, our local advertising sales force and our programmatic advertising buying solution are key elements of our strategy to expand our penetration of the radio advertising market. Our success in executing this strategy is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in "Risk Factors."
Pandora Subscription and Other Revenue
Prior to the launch of Pandora Plus, subscription and other revenue was generated primarily through the sale of Pandora One. Subsequent to the launch of Pandora Plus, subscription and other revenue is generated primarily through the sale of Pandora Plus. Pandora Plus is an enhanced version of the Pandora service, which currently includes product features such as replays, additional skipping and offline listening, together with our advertisement-free access and higher audio quality on the devices that support it. Pandora Plus is primarily available for purchase through major app stores and through the Pandora website. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, subscription and other revenue accounted for 20%, 19% and 16% of our total revenue, respectively. 
Ticketing Service Revenue
Ticketing service revenue is generated primarily from service and merchant processing fees generated on ticket sales through the Ticketfly platform. Ticketfly sells tickets to fans for events on behalf of clients and charges a fee per ticket, which generally increases as the face value of the ticket increases, or a percentage of the total convenience charge and order processing fee, for its services at the time the ticket for an event is sold. Ticketing service revenue is recorded net of the face value of the ticket at the time of the sale, as Ticketfly generally acts as the agent in these transactions. As Ticketfly was acquired on October 31, 2015, the consolidated statements of operations include ticketing service revenue for the two months ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, ticketing service revenue accounted for approximately 1% and 6% of our total revenue. We had no ticketing service revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014.
Pandora Content, Copyrights and Royalties
The content we stream to users of the Pandora service consists primarily of music. To stream music, we must obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, copyright owners, or their agents, for each sound recording that we stream, as well as for each underlying musical work, subject to certain exclusions. These licensing and royalty arrangements strongly impact our business operations. Refer to our discussion of these matters in Item 1A—"Risk Factors".
In 2015 and 2016, we signed direct license agreements with major and independent labels and distributors for sound recordings as well as publishers and composers for the musical works contained in such sound recordings. These agreements allow us to provide new and improved products that include enhanced features such as replays of the sound recordings, additional skipping capability, offline stations and on-demand listening. Certain of these license agreements include minimum guarantee payments, some of which are paid in advance. Refer to Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for our policy on prepaid content acquisition costs. 
Sound Recordings
Prior to signing direct license agreements with major and independent labels and distributors, we obtained all performance rights licenses and paid performance rights royalties mainly pursuant to the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 (the "DPRA") and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA"). Under federal statutory licenses created by the DPRA and the DMCA, we are permitted to stream any lawfully released sound recordings and to make reproductions of these recordings on our computer servers without having to separately negotiate and obtain direct licenses with each individual sound recording copyright owner. These statutory licenses are available on the condition that we operate in compliance with the rules of the statutory licenses and pay the applicable royalty rates. 
Prior to signing direct license agreements with major and independent labels and distributors, we paid all performance rights royalties for sound recordings we streamed on our services to SoundExchange, the non-profit organization designated by the Copyright Royalty Board (the "CRB"), a tribunal established within the U.S. Library of Congress, to collect and distribute royalties under these statutory licenses. On December 16, 2015, the CRB announced the new per-performance rates that apply for commercial webcasters for calendar years 2016 through 2020 (the "Web IV Proceeding"). Absent direct licenses in place with major and independent labels and distributors, effective January 1, 2016, the content acquisition costs we paid for sound recordings were set by the Web IV Proceeding. The rates for non-subscription services, including our ad-supported service, were set at $0.0017 per performance for 2016. The rates for subscription services, applicable to our Pandora One service, were set at $0.0022 per performance for 2016.
Subsequent to September 15, 2016, the majority of the content acquisition costs related to our ad-supported and subscription services are driven by direct license agreements with major and independent labels and distributors. Depending on the applicable service, these license agreements generally require us to pay either a per-performance fee based on the number of sound recordings we transmit, a percentage of revenue associated with the service or a per-subscriber minimum amount, all generally subject to certain discounts. Certain of these license agreements include minimum guarantee payments, some of which are paid in advance.
If we have not entered into a direct license agreement with the copyright owner of a particular sound recording that is streamed on our services, we stream that sound recording pursuant to the statutory license and pay the applicable Web IV Proceeding rate. Enhanced features of our services, such as replays of sound recordings, additional skipping capability and offline stations, are not available for sound recordings streamed under the statutory license and paid at the Web IV Proceeding rate.
Musical Works
Our content costs also include the royalties we pay for the musical works embodied in the sound recordings that we stream. Prior to January 1, 2016, we obtained the rights to stream musical works on both our ad-supported and subscription services by obtaining so-called “blanket” licenses from performing rights organizations ("PROs"), such as the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers ("ASCAP"), Broadcast Music, Inc. ("BMI"), SESAC, Inc. ("SESAC") and Global Music Rights ("GMR"). These PROs are organized to aggregate rights in musical works from millions of songwriters and publishers, negotiate blanket licenses with copyright users (such as Pandora), collect royalties under such licenses and distribute them to copyright owners. The blanket licenses that we obtained from PROs traditionally obligated us to pay a percentage of our revenue or a flat fee.
In 2015 and 2016, we signed new direct license agreements with PROs and thousands of music publishers that grant us the rights to stream musical works under their control on both our ad-supported and subscription services for a multi-year period. Prior to September 15, 2016, the combined effect of these licenses was that each copyright holder received its usage-based and ownership-based share of a royalty pool equal to 20% of the content acquisition costs paid by us for sound recordings on the respective tier of service. Subsequent to September 15, 2016, this calculation still applies to our ad-supported service, but content acquisition costs for the streaming of musical works on our subscription services are equal to the rates determined in accordance with the statutory license set forth in 17 U.S.C. §115 ("Section 115"). If we have not entered into a 
direct license agreement with the copyright owner of a particular musical work, or a PRO representing the copyright owner, then we stream that musical work pursuant to the Section 115 statutory license and pay the applicable rate.
Rate-Setting Proceedings for Reproduction Rights under Section 115 
The current rate structure for the statutory license for reproduction rights under Section 115 expires at the end of 2017. We are currently one of five commercial music service operators (along with Amazon, Apple, Google and Spotify) participating in rate-setting proceedings in which three judges of the CRB will determine the Section 115 rates for calendar years 2018 to 2022 (the "Phonorecords III Proceedings"). The Nashville Songwriters Association International, the National Association of Music Publishers and George Johnson Music Publishing are also participating in the Phonorecords III Proceedings. A trial before the CRB is expected to commence in March 2017, and the CRB is expected to render a decision prior to the end of 2017. The rates established by the CRB in the Phonorecords III Proceedings may be higher, lower or the same as the rates currently in effect.

The Phonorecords III Proceedings are important to us because our direct licenses with music publishers reference the Section 115 rates. As a result, any increase in the Section 115 rates would increase our content acquisition costs, which, if such increase were substantial, could materially harm our financial condition and hinder our ability to provide interactive features in our services, or cause one or more of our subscription services to not be economically viable.
Non-U.S. Licensing Regimes
In addition to the copyright and licensing arrangements described above for our use of sound recordings and musical works in the United States, we have obtained licenses in Australia and New Zealand for the communication of sound recordings and the musical works embodied in those sound recordings, which have not had a material effect on our results of operations to date. 
Government Regulation
As a company conducting business on the internet, we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security and data protection, among other things. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In the area of information security and data protection, the laws in several states require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of information. Likewise, all but a few states have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their information. We are also subject to federal and state laws regarding privacy of listener data, among other things. Our privacy policy and terms of use describe our practices concerning the use, transmission and disclosure of listener information and are posted on our website. 
Sales and Marketing
Pandora—Internet Radio Service
We organize our Pandora sales force into multiple geographically-based teams that are each focused on selling advertising across our computer, mobile and other connected device platforms. Teams are located in our Oakland, California headquarters, in regional sales offices throughout the United States and local sales offices throughout the United States, in Australia and in New Zealand. 
Our marketing team is charged with using all forms of communications to reach our business and reputational goals. We organize the marketing team into four groups focused on campaign planning and analytics, consumer marketing, communications and our Music Makers Group. While we have historically relied on the success of viral marketing to expand consumer awareness of our service, in 2014 we began to launch marketing campaigns to increase consumer awareness and expand our listener base and in 2015, we began to launch advertising campaigns to increase the awareness of our brand. We anticipate that we will continue to utilize these types of advertising campaigns in the future.
Ticketing Service
The Ticketfly sales force is organized into various teams based on vertical, such as client type, and is focused on obtaining contracts with clients to sell tickets on the Ticketfly platform. Teams are located in the Ticketfly headquarters in San Francisco, California and in local sales offices throughout the United States and in Canada.
Artist Relations
Pandora Music Makers Group 
In 2014, to consolidate all of our music industry initiatives, and to help drive connections with fans across all channels at Pandora, we brought the teams across the business that work most directly with the music industry together into a single group known as the Music Makers Group. Our vision is to ensure artists can promote and market their music to fans, drive engagement with experiences from live events to original content and audio messages to fans and understand all of the benefits of these interactions via our analytics tools.
Pandora Artist Marketing Platform
Pandora AMP consists of products and programs that enable music makers to leverage data to grow an audience, track progress and connect with fans on Pandora. Since its original launch focusing on artist data and insights in 2014, AMP has evolved into a set of powerful self-serve marketing tools including Artist Audio Messaging, AMPcast and Featured Tracks. Newly added features of AMP, which include a dynamic feed of an artist’s campaign, performance metrics and suggestions for new campaigns, were launched in October 2016 alongside a data integration with Next Big Sound, shifting artist insights and analytics to the NBS platform and enhancing the set of desktop and mobile marketing tools offered via AMP.
Derived from tens of billions of hours of personalized listening on Pandora, the marketing tools on AMP along with the analytics tools on NBS are available to all artists spinning on Pandora and their teams. Additionally, enterprise-level tools and marketing opportunities are available to artist and label teams who have opted into a direct deal with Pandora.
Competition
Pandora—Internet Radio Service
Competition for Listeners
We compete for the time and attention of our listeners with other content providers on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of experience, relevance, acceptance and perception of content quality, ease of use, price, accessibility, perceptions of ad load on our ad-supported service, brand awareness and reputation. We also compete for listeners on the basis of our presence, branding and visibility as compared with other providers that deliver content through the internet, mobile devices and consumer products. We believe that we compete favorably on these factors. For additional details on risks related to competition for listeners, please refer to Item 1A—"Risk Factors."
Many of our current and potential future competitors enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, legacy operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as greater financial, technical and other resources. We compete with many forms of digital media for the time and attention of our listeners, such as Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, Pinterest and Instagram. Our direct audio competitors, however, include iHeartRadio, LastFM and other companies in the traditional broadcast and internet radio market. We also directly compete with the non-interactive, internet radio offerings from providers such as Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Google Play Music and Slacker.
We compete for listeners with broadcast radio providers, including terrestrial radio providers. Many broadcast radio conglomerates own large numbers of radio stations or other media properties. Many terrestrial radio stations broadcast digital signals, which provide high quality audio transmission. We compete for listeners indirectly with satellite radio providers, whose content is more heavily skewed to spoken word and talk, sports and business-related content versus traditional radio whose content is more heavily skewed to music.
Broadcast and satellite radio companies generally enjoy larger established audiences and a significant cost advantage because they pay a much lower percentage of revenue for content acquisition costs. Broadcast radio companies pay no content acquisition costs for the radio broadcast of sound recordings, and satellite radio companies paid only 10.5% of revenue in 2016 and will pay only 11% of revenue in 2017 for satellite transmissions of sound recordings. By contrast, Pandora incurred content acquisition costs for our internet transmissions of sound recordings representing 44.2% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016. 
We also face competition for listeners and listener hours from on-demand music streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, SoundCloud, Google Play Music, Amazon Prime, Rhapsody, and Deezer. These services offer consumers the ability to choose the songs and artists they want to hear and create customized playlists - functionality that our 
service does not currently provide. When Pandora Premium launches in 2017, we will more directly compete against these on-demand services. This on-demand content is accessible in automobiles and homes, using portable players, mobile phones and other wireless and consumer electronic devices. The audio entertainment marketplace continues to rapidly evolve, providing our listeners with a growing number of alternatives and new media platforms.
At a macro level, we compete for the time and attention of our listeners with providers of other forms of in-home and mobile entertainment. To the extent existing or potential listeners choose to watch cable television, stream video from on-demand services or play interactive video games on their home-entertainment system, computer or mobile phone rather than listen to the Pandora service, these content services pose an adjacent competitive threat for consumer time and mindshare.
Competition for Advertisers
We compete with traditional media products and services, and with other internet-based services, for a share of our advertising customers' overall marketing budgets. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including perceived return on investment, effectiveness and relevance of our advertising products, reporting and pricing structure and ability to deliver large volumes or precise types of ads to targeted demographics. We believe that our ability to deliver targeted and relevant ads across a wide range of platforms allows us to compete favorably on the basis of these factors and justify a long-term profitable pricing structure. However, the market for online advertising is intensely competitive and rapidly changing, and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. 
The market for online advertising has become increasingly competitive, yet advertisers are allocating increasing amounts of their overall marketing budgets to online advertising. We compete for online advertisers with other internet companies, including major internet portals, search engine companies and social media sites. Large internet companies with greater brand recognition have significant numbers of direct sales personnel, more advanced programmatic advertising capabilities and substantial proprietary advertising inventory and web traffic that provide a significant competitive advantage and have a significant impact on pricing for internet advertising and web traffic. 
Terrestrial broadcast, and to a lesser extent satellite radio, are sources of competition for advertising dollars. These radio providers deliver ads across a more familiar platform than the internet may be to traditional advertisers. 
Our competitors include Facebook, Google, Snap, Yahoo! and traditional media such as ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. We directly compete against iHeartRadio, Entercom, CBS Radio, Cumulus and other companies of the traditional broadcast radio market. For additional details on risks related to competition for advertisers, please refer to Item 1A—"Risk Factors." 
Ticketing Service
Competition for Clients
We compete with other online live events technology and primary ticketing companies for contracts with our clients, which are promoters and venues. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including our ability to sell tickets and provide enhanced fan experiences. Our ticketing platform also offers website, email, social marketing, booking, analytics, fan CRM and other tools for our clients. Cloud technology has made it easier for other technology-based companies to offer primary ticketing services and standalone, automated ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize self-ticketing systems. We also experience competition from other national, regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure contracts with new promoters and venues. Our main competitors for clients include primary ticketing companies such as Live Nation Entertainment's Ticketmaster division, Tickets.com, AXS and Paciolan and upstart providers such as Eventbrite and eTix. Some of these competitors have greater brand recognition, and financial, technical and other resources, than we do.
Competition for Fans
We compete with other live events technology and primary ticketing companies, as well as secondary ticketing companies for ticket sales to fans. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including our ability to reach fans and provide enhanced fan experiences. The ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online channels, but also through telephone, mobile devices and ticket outlets. In the online environment, we compete with other websites, live events technology and ticketing companies to provide event information, sell tickets and provide other online services. We experience competition from other national, regional and local primary ticketing service providers to reach fans for events. Resale, or secondary, ticketing services have created automated internet "bot" technology to attempt to bypass 
queues and buy tickets when they go on sale, so that these services may then re-sell those tickets to fans at increased prices. Our main competitors for fans include primary ticketing companies such as Live Nation Entertainment's Ticketmaster division, Tickets.com, AXS and Paciolan, upstart providers such as Eventbrite and eTix and secondary ticketing companies such as StubHub.
Seasonality
Pandora—Internet Radio Service
Our results reflect the effects of seasonal trends in listener and advertising behavior. We expect to experience both higher advertising sales due to greater advertiser demand during the holiday season and increased usage due to the popularity of holiday music during the fourth quarter of each calendar year. In addition, in the first quarter of each calendar year, we expect to experience lower advertising sales due to reduced advertiser demand, and increased usage by listeners due to increased use of media-streaming devices received as gifts during the holiday season. See the section entitled "Business Trends" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more complete description of the seasonality of our financial results.
Ticketing Service
Ticketfly's results reflect the effects of seasonality related to the timing of events. Tickets for festivals, which constitute a significant portion of Ticketfly's business, typically go on sale during the first half of the year. As such, the Ticketfly business has historically experienced an increase in revenue in the first half of each year relative to the fourth quarter of the prior year. We expect these seasonal trends to continue to affect our operating results.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our technologies and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, contractual restrictions, technological measures and other methods. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and business partners, and we control access to and distribution of our technology and proprietary information.
We have filed and acquired dozens of active patent applications and issued patents in the United States and other countries. We continue to pursue additional patent protection, both in the United States and abroad where appropriate and cost effective. We intend to hold these patents as part of our strategy to protect and defend Pandora in patent-related litigation. We also acquire patents and patent applications from time to time as part of other transactions.
Our registered trademarks in the United States include "Pandora," the "Music Genome Project," and "Ticketfly," in addition to a number of Pandora logos and other Pandora marks. "Pandora" is also registered in Australia, Canada, Chile, the European Union, India, Israel, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Switzerland, Taiwan and other countries. "Music Genome Project" is also registered in Australia, Canada, China and New Zealand. We have pending trademark applications in the United States and other countries for Pandora names and marks.
We are the registrant of the internet domain names for our primary websites, pandora.com and ticketfly.com, as well as others related to our current and potential businesses. 
In addition to the forms of intellectual property listed above, we own rights to proprietary processes and trade secrets, including those underlying the Pandora service. We use contractual, policy and technological means to generally control access to, use and distribution of our proprietary software, trade secrets and other confidential information, both internally and externally, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners.
