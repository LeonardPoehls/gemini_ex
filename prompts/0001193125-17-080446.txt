Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a nationwide provider of credit products and services to small businesses. The products and services we provide to our customers include loans and leases for the acquisition of commercial equipment, working capital loans, and insurance products. Our average original transaction size was approximately $15,000 at December 31, 2016, and we typically do not exceed $250,000 for any single transaction. We access our end user customers primarily through origination sources consisting of independent commercial equipment dealers, various national account programs, through direct solicitation of our end user customers, and through relationships with select lease and loan brokers. We use both a telephonic direct sales model and, for strategic larger accounts, outside sales executives to market to our origination sources and end user customers. Through these origination sources, we are able to cost-effectively access end user customers while also helping our origination sources obtain financing for their customers. As of December 31, 2016, we serviced approximately 86,000 finance contracts having a total original value of $1.3 billion for approximately 72,000 small business customers. 
 The small balance commercial financing market is highly fragmented. We estimate that there are more than 100,000 independent commercial equipment dealers and other intermediaries who sell the types of equipment we finance or require the types of financing we provide. We believe this segment of equipment dealers is underserved because: (1) the large commercial finance companies and large commercial banks typically concentrate their efforts on marketing their products and services directly to larger equipment manufacturers and larger distributors, rather than to independent equipment dealers; and (2) many smaller commercial finance companies and regional banking institutions have not developed the systems and infrastructure required to adequately service large volumes of low-balance transactions. We focus on establishing our relationships with independent equipment dealers who value convenient point-of-sale lease financing programs because we can make their sales process more effective. By providing them with the ability to offer our financing and related services to their customers as an integrated part of their selling process, our origination sources have the opportunity to increase their sales and provide better service to their customers. By doing this, we are also able to gather small business end user customers to which we can sell additional credit products and services through our fully integrated origination platform which allows us to efficiently solicit, process, and service a large number of low-balance financing transactions. From our inception in 1997 to December 31, 2016, we have processed approximately 1,038,000 lease applications and originated over 436,000 new leases. 
 Through the issuance of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured deposits, the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, Marlin Business Bank (MBB), serves as the Companys primary funding source. MBB receives time deposits through a variety of sources including: directly from customers, through the use of on-line listing services, and through the use of deposit brokers. In the future MBB may elect to offer other products and services to the Companys customer base. As a Utah state-chartered Federal Reserve member bank, MBB is supervised by both the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions.

On January 13, 2009, Marlin Business Services Corp. became a bank holding company and is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act and supervised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. On September 15, 2010, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia confirmed the effectiveness of Marlin Business Services Corp.s election to become a financial holding company (while remaining a bank holding company) pursuant to Sections 4(k) and (l) of the Bank Holding Company Act and Section 225.82 of the Federal Reserve Boards Regulation Y. Such election permits Marlin Business Services Corp. to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity, including the maintenance and expansion of our reinsurance activities conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary, AssuranceOne, Ltd. (AssuranceOne). 
 Reorganization 
 Marlin Leasing Corporation (MLC) was incorporated in Delaware on June 16, 1997. On August 5, 2003, we incorporated Marlin Business Services Corp. in Pennsylvania. On November 11, 2003, we reorganized our operations into a holding company structure by merging MLC with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marlin Business Services Corp. As a result, all former shareholders of MLC became shareholders of Marlin Business Services Corp. MLC remains in existence as our primary operating subsidiary. 
Competitive Strengths 
 We believe several characteristics may distinguish us from our competitors, including the following: 
 Multiple Sales Origination Channels. We use multiple sales origination channels to penetrate effectively the highly diversified and fragmented small-ticket equipment leasing market. Our direct origination channels, which account for approximately 89% of the active lease contracts in our portfolio, involve: (1) establishing relationships with independent equipment dealers; (2) securing endorsements from national equipment manufacturers and distributors to become the preferred lease financing source for the independent dealers who sell their equipment; and (3) soliciting our existing end user customer base for repeat business. Our indirect origination channels account for approximately 11% of the active lease contracts in our portfolio and consist of our relationships with brokers and certain equipment dealers who refer transactions to us for a fee or sell leases to us that they originate. Indirect business represented 12% of 2016 originations, while direct business represented 88%. 
 Highly Effective Account Origination Platform. Our telephonic direct marketing platform and our strategic use of outside sales account executives offer origination sources a high level of personalized service through our team of 135 sales account executives and sales support personnel. Our business model is built on a real-time, fully integrated customer information database and a contact management and telephony application that facilitate our account solicitation and servicing functions. 
 Comprehensive Credit Process. We seek to manage credit risk effectively at the origination source as well as at the transaction and portfolio levels. Our comprehensive credit process starts with the qualification and ongoing review of our origination sources. Once the origination source is approved, our credit process focuses on analyzing and underwriting the end user customer and the specific financing transaction, regardless of whether the transaction was originated through our direct or indirect origination channels. Our underwriting process involves the use of our customized acquisition scorecards along with detailed rules-based analysis conducted by our team of seasoned credit analysts. 
 Portfolio Diversification. As of December 31, 2016, no single end user customer accounted for more than 0.08% of our portfolio balance and leases from our largest origination source accounted for only 1.38% of our portfolio. Our portfolio is also diversified nationwide with the largest state portfolios existing in California (13%), Texas (10%) and Florida (10%). 
 Fully Integrated Information Management System. Our business integrates information technology solutions to optimize the sales origination, credit, collection and account servicing functions. Throughout a transaction, we collect a significant amount of information on our origination sources and end user customers. The enterprise-wide integration of our systems enables data collected by one group, such as credit, to be used by other groups, such as sales or collections, to better perform their functions. 
 
-3- 
 
Sophisticated Collections Environment. Our centralized collections department is structured to collect delinquent accounts, minimize credit losses and maximize post charge-off recovery dollars. Our collection strategy employs a delinquency bucket segmentation approach, where certain collectors are assigned to accounts based on their delinquency status. We also stratify and assign our accounts to collectors based on other relevant criteria, such as customers with an early missed payment, risk profile and transaction size. This segmentation approach allows us to assign our more experienced collectors to the late stage delinquent accounts. In addition, the collections department also focuses on collecting delinquent late fees, property taxes, and other outstanding amounts due under the customers contracts. 
 Access to Multiple Funding Sources. We have established and maintained diversified funding sources, with our wholly-owned subsidiary, MBB. MBB is currently our primary funding source through the issuance of fixed and variable rate FDIC-insured deposits raised nationally through various deposit brokers. Our proven ability to access funding consistently at competitive rates through various economic cycles provides us with the liquidity necessary to manage our business. (See Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7). 
 Experienced Management Team. Our executive officers have an average of more than 20 years of experience in financial services. As we have grown, we have expanded the management team with a group of successful, seasoned executives. 
Disciplined Growth Strategy 
 Our primary objective is to enhance our current position as a provider of credit services to small and mid-sized businesses by pursuing a strategy focused primarily on organic growth initiatives while actively managing credit risk. We seek to maintain consistent credit quality standards while continuing to pursue strategies designed to increase the number of independent equipment dealers and other origination sources that generate and develop lease and loan customers. We also target strategies to further penetrate our existing origination sources. 
Asset Originations 
 Overview of Origination Process. We access our end user customers through our extensive network of independent equipment dealers and through the direct solicitation of our end user customers. We use both a highly efficient telephonic direct sales model and, for strategic larger accounts, outside sales executives to market to our origination sources. Through these sources, we are able to deliver convenient and flexible financing solutions to our end user customers. 
 Our origination process begins with our database of thousands of origination source prospects located throughout the United States. We develop and continually update this database by purchasing marketing data from third parties, such as Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., by joining industry organizations and by attending equipment trade shows. The prospects in our database are systematically distributed to our sales force for solicitation and further data collection. Sales account executives access prospect information and related marketing data through our contact management software. This contact management software enables the sales account executives to sort their origination sources and prospects by any data field captured, schedule calling campaigns, send e-mails, produce correspondence and documents, manage their time and calendar, track activity, recycle leads and review management reports. 
 Once a sales account executive converts a prospect into an active relationship, that sales account executive becomes the origination sources single point of contact for all dealings with us. This approach, which is a cornerstone of our origination platform, offers our origination sources a personal relationship through which they can address all of their questions and needs, including matters relating to pricing, credit, documentation, training and marketing. This single point of contact approach distinguishes us from our competitors, many of whom require origination sources to interface with several people in various departments, such as sales support, credit 
 
-4- 
 
 and customer service, for each application submitted. Since many of our origination sources have little or no prior experience in using lease financing as a sales tool, our personalized, single point of contact approach facilitates the leasing process for them. Other key aspects of our platform aimed at facilitating the lease financing process for the origination sources include: 
 

 | ability to submit applications via fax, phone, Internet, mail, e-mail, or web portal;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | credit decisions generally within two hours;
--+---------------------------------------------


 | one-page, plain-English form of lease for transactions up to $100,000;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ability to use electronic documents with instantaneous routing;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | check, wire, or ACH funding to the origination source once all lease and loan origination conditions are satisfied;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | value-added services, such as application and portfolio reporting, marketing support and sales training on the benefits of financing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | online portal for dealers to view current status and important information about their customers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | on-site or telephonic training of the equipment dealers sales force on leasing as a sales tool; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | custom leases and loan programs.
--+---------------------------------

 Of our 318 total employees as of December 31, 2016, we employed 135 sales account executives, each of whom receives a base salary and earns commissions based on his or her lease and loan originations. We also have six employees dedicated to marketing as of December 31, 2016. 
 Sales Origination Channels. We primarily use direct sales origination channels to penetrate effectively a multitude of origination sources in the highly diversified and fragmented small-ticket equipment leasing market. All inside sales account executives use our telephonic direct marketing sales model to solicit these origination sources and end user customers. 
 Direct Channels. Our direct sales origination channels, which account for approximately 89% of the active lease contracts in our portfolio, involve: 
 

 | Independent Equipment Dealer Solicitations. This origination channel focuses on soliciting and establishing relationships with independent equipment dealers in a variety of equipment categories located across the United States. Our typical independent equipment dealer has less than $12.0 million in annual revenues and fewer than 50 employees. Service is a key determinant in becoming the preferred provider of financing recommended by these equipment dealers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Major and National Accounts. This channel focuses on two specific areas of development: (i) national equipment manufacturers and distributors, where we seek to leverage their endorsements to become the preferred lease financing source for their independent dealers, and (ii) major accounts (larger independent dealers, distributors and manufacturers) with a consistent flow of business that need a specialized marketing and sales platform to convert more sales using a leasing option.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | End User Customer Solicitations. This channel focuses primarily on soliciting our existing portfolio of approximately 72,000 end user customers for additional equipment leasing or working capital opportunities. We view our existing end user customers as an excellent source for additional business for various reasons, including (i) retained credit information; (ii) consistent payment histories; and (iii) a demonstrated propensity to finance their equipment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Indirect Channels. Our indirect origination channels account for approximately 11% of the active lease contracts in our portfolio and consist of our relationships with lease brokers and certain equipment dealers who refer end user customer transactions to us for a fee or sell us leases that they originated with end user customers. We conduct our own independent credit analysis on each end user customer in an indirect lease 
 
-5- 
 
 transaction. We have written agreements with most of our indirect origination sources whereby they provide us with certain representations and warranties about the underlying lease transaction. The origination sources in our indirect channels generate leases that are similar to those generated by our direct channels. 
 Sales Recruiting, Training and Mentoring 
 Sales account executive candidates are screened for previous sales experience and communication skills, phone presence and teamwork orientation and are asked to complete personality profiles to ensure their skills align with those of our most successful sales account executives. Each new sales account executive undergoes a comprehensive training program shortly after he or she is hired. The training program covers the fundamentals of lease finance and introduces the sales account executive to our origination and credit policies and procedures. New sales account executives also receive technical training on our databases and our information management tools and techniques. At the end of the program, the sales account executives are monitored closely to ensure they meet our performance standards and work directly with the sales managers to resolve any performance issues. In addition to our formal training program, sales account executives receive extensive on-the-job training and mentoring. All sales account executives sit in groups, providing newer sales account executives the opportunity to learn first-hand from their more senior peers. In addition, our sales managers frequently monitor and coach sales account executives during phone calls, providing immediate feedback. Our sales account executives also receive continuing education and training, including periodic, detailed presentations on our contact management system, underwriting guidelines and sales enhancement techniques. 
Product Offerings 
 Equipment Leases. The types of lease products offered by each of our sales origination channels share common characteristics, and we generally underwrite our leases using the same criteria. Our leases provide for non-cancelable rental payments due during the initial lease term. The initial non-cancelable lease term is equal to or less than the equipments economic life. Initial terms generally range from 36 to 60 months. At December 31, 2016, the average original term of the leases in our portfolio was approximately 48 months, and we had personal guarantees on approximately 38% of our leases. The remaining terms and conditions of our leases are substantially similar, generally requiring end user customers to, among other things: 

 | address any maintenance or service issues directly with the equipment dealer or manufacturer;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | insure the equipment against property and casualty loss;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | pay or reimburse us for all taxes associated with the equipment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | use the equipment only for business purposes; and
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | make all scheduled payments regardless of the performance of the equipment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We charge late fees when appropriate throughout the term of the lease. Our standard lease contract provides that in the event of a default, we can require payment of the entire balance due under the lease through the initial term and can take action to seize and remove the equipment for subsequent sale, refinancing or other disposal at our discretion, subject to any limitations imposed by law. 
 At the time of application, end user customers select a purchase option that will allow them to purchase the equipment at the end of the contract term for either one dollar, the fair market value of the equipment or a specified percentage of the original equipment cost. We seek to realize our recorded residual in leased equipment at the end of the initial lease term by collecting the purchase option price from the end user customer, re-marketing the equipment in the secondary market or receiving additional rental payments pursuant to the applicable contracts renewal provision.

Property Insurance on Leased Equipment. Our lease agreements specifically require the end user customers to obtain all-risk property insurance in an amount equal to the replacement value of the equipment and to designate us as the loss payee on the policy. If the end user customer already has a commercial property policy for its business, it can satisfy its obligation under the lease by delivering a certificate of insurance that evidences us as the loss payee under that policy. At December 31, 2016, approximately 53% of our end user customers insured the equipment under their existing policies. For the others, we offer an insurance product through a master property insurance policy underwritten by a third-party national insurance company that is licensed to write insurance under our program in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. This master policy names us as the beneficiary for all of the equipment insured under the policy and provides all-risk coverage for the replacement cost of the equipment. 
 In May 2000, we established AssuranceOne, our Bermuda-based, wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary which enables us to reinsure the property insurance coverage for the equipment financed by MLC and MBB for our end user customers. Under this contract, AssuranceOne reinsures 100% of the risk under the master policy, and the issuing insurer pays AssuranceOne the policy premiums, less claims, premium tax and a ceding fee based on a percentage of annual net premiums written. The reinsurance contract is scheduled to expire in May 2018. On January 27, 2010, pursuant to an application filed with the Bermuda Monetary Authority, AssuranceOne changed from a Class 1 insurer to a Class 3 insurer under the Bermuda Insurance Act of 1978, as amended. As a Class 3 insurer, AssuranceOne is permitted to collect up to 50% of its premiums in connection with insurance coverage on equipment unrelated to the Company, meaning that, through AssuranceOne, we may offer an insurance product to cover equipment not otherwise financed through the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2016, of our total insurance income of $6.4 million, no income was recognized in connection with our insurance product covering equipment not financed through the Company. 
 Funding Stream: Small Business Loans. During the first quarter of 2015, the Company launched Funding Stream, a new, flexible loan program of MBB. Funding Stream is tailored to the small business market to provide customers a convenient, hassle-free alternative to traditional lenders and access to capital to help grow their businesses. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $19.9 million of book value of small business loans on the balance sheet. Generally, these loans range from $5,000 to $150,000, have flexible 6 to 24 month terms, and have automated daily, weekly, and monthly payback. Small business owners can apply online, in ten minutes or less, on Fundingstream.com. Approved borrowers can receive funds in as little as two days. Approximately 40% of our Funding Stream customers renew or take additional capital. 
Portfolio Overview 
 At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 86,000 active leases in our portfolio, representing aggregate minimum lease payments receivable of $867.8 million. With respect to our portfolio at December 31, 2016:

Information Management 
 A critical element of our business operations is our ability to collect detailed information on our origination sources and end user customers at all stages of a financing transaction and to manage that information effectively so that it can be used across all aspects of our business. Our information management system integrates a number of technologies to optimize our sales origination, credit, collection and account servicing functions. Applications used across our business include: 

 | a customer relationship management system that: (1) summarizes vital information on our prospects, origination sources, competitors and end user customers compiled from third-party data, trade associations, manufacturers, transaction information and data collected through the sales solicitation process; and (2) produces detailed reports using a variety of data fields to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our sales account executives;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a call management reporting system that systematically analyzes call activity patterns to improve inbound and outbound calling campaigns for originations, collections and customer service;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our information technology platform infrastructure is industry standard and fully scalable to support future growth. Our systems are backed up to an off-site storage provider after each business day. In addition, we have contracted with a third party for disaster recovery services. 
 Credit Underwriting 
 Credit underwriting is separately performed and managed apart from asset origination. Credit analysts are located in our New Jersey corporate office and at MBBs office in Salt Lake City, Utah. At December 31, 2016 we had a total of 21 credit analysts, each with an average of approximately 12 years of experience. Each credit analysts performance is measured monthly against a discrete set of performance variables, including decision turnaround time, performance metrics and adherence to our underwriting policies and procedures. 
 
-9- 
 
Our typical financing transaction involves three parties: the origination source, the end user customer and us. The key elements of our comprehensive credit underwriting process include the qualification and ongoing review of origination sources, the performance of due diligence procedures on each end user customer and the monitoring of overall portfolio trends and underwriting standards. 
 Qualification and Ongoing Review of Origination Sources. Each origination source is reviewed and qualified by the credit analyst. The origination sources credit information and references are reviewed as part of the qualification process. Over time, our database has captured credit profiles on thousands of origination sources. We regularly track all applications and lease and loan originations by source, assessing whether the origination source has a high application decline rate and analyzing the delinquency rates on the leases and loans originated through that source. Any unusual situations that arise involving the origination source are noted in the sources file. Each origination source is reviewed on a regular basis using portfolio performance statistics as well as any other information noted in the sources file. We will place an origination source on watch status if its portfolio performance statistics are consistently below our expectations. If the origination sources statistics do not improve in a timely manner, we often stop accepting applications from that origination source. Some of our business is originated directly with the end user, therefore there is no origination source involved. 
 End User Customer Review. Each end user customers application is reviewed using our customized acquisition scorecards along with our rules-based set of underwriting guidelines that focus on predictive commercial and consumer credit data. These underwriting guidelines have been developed and refined by our management team based on proven best practices and its experience in extending credit to small and mid-sized businesses. The guidelines are reviewed and revised as necessary by our Credit Committee, which is comprised of our Chief Credit Officer, Chief Executive Officer, Senior Vice President of Portfolio Management, President of MBB and Chief Lending Officer of MBB. Our underwriting guidelines require a thorough credit investigation of the end user customer. The guidelines may also include an analysis of the personal credit of the owner, who may guarantee the transaction, and verification of the corporate name and location. The credit analyst may also consider other factors in the credit decision process, including: 

 | financial strength of the business;
--+------------------------------------


 | length of time in business;
--+----------------------------


 | confirmation of actual business operations and ownership;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | management history, including prior business experience;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | size of the business, including the number of employees;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | third-party commercial credit data and consumer credit data (when applicable);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | legal structure of business; and
--+---------------------------------


 | fraud indicators.
--+------------------

 Transactions over $100,000 receive a higher level of scrutiny, may include a review of financial statements or tax returns and a review of the business purpose of the equipment to the end user customer. 
 Within two hours of receipt of the application, the credit analyst is usually ready to render a credit decision on transactions less than $50,000. If there is insufficient information to render a credit decision, a request for more information will be made by the credit analyst. Credit approvals are typically valid for up to a 90-day period from the date of initial approval. In the event that the funding does not occur within the initial approval period, a re-approval may be issued after the credit analyst has reprocessed all the relevant credit information to determine that the creditworthiness of the applicant has not deteriorated. 
 In some instances after a lease is approved, a phone verification with the end user customer is performed by us prior to funding the transaction. The purpose of this call is to review the terms and conditions of the lease 
 
-10- 
 
 contract, confirm the customers satisfaction with the equipment and obtain additional billing information. We will delay paying the origination source for the equipment if the credit operations analyst uncovers any material issues during the phone verification. 
 Since mid-2009, we have been using proprietary, customized acquisition scorecards for use in our credit decisioning process based on our database of historical information. The scorecards are tested and validated on an ongoing basis by credit and non-credit subject matter experts both inside and outside the organization. The scorecards key attributes and mathematical computations are periodically modified. The scorecards enable us to increase efficiencies and consistency in the credit decisioning process. In 2016, approximately 39% of credit decisions made on new applications have been made using the scorecards. 
 Monitoring of Portfolio Trends and Underwriting Standards. Credit personnel use our databases and our information management tools to monitor the characteristics and attributes of our overall portfolio. Reports are produced to analyze origination source performance, end user customer delinquencies, portfolio concentrations, trends and other related indicators of portfolio performance. Any significant findings are presented to the Credit Committee for review and action. 
 Our internal credit surveillance and internal audit teams are responsible for monitoring to ensure that the credit department adheres to all underwriting guidelines. The examinations conducted by these departments are designed to monitor our origination sources, the appropriateness of exceptions to our underwriting guidelines and documentation quality. Management reports are regularly generated by these departments detailing the results of these surveillance and audit activities. 
 Account Servicing 
 We service the leases we originate. Account servicing involves a variety of functions performed by numerous work groups, including: 
 

 | entering the lease into our accounting and billing system;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | preparing the invoice information;
--+-----------------------------------


 | generally, filing Uniform Commercial Code financing statements on leases in excess of $50,000;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | paying the equipment dealers for leased equipment and services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | billing, collecting and remitting sales, use and property taxes to the taxing jurisdictions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | assuring compliance with insurance requirements; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


 | providing customer service to the leasing customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 Our integrated lease processing and accounting systems automate many of the functions associated with servicing high volumes of small-ticket leasing transactions. 
 Collection Process 
 Our centralized collections department is structured to collect delinquent accounts, minimize credit losses and maximize post-default recovery dollars. Our collection strategy employs a delinquency bucket segmentation approach, where certain collectors are assigned to accounts based on their delinquency status. The collectors are individually accountable for their results and a meaningful portion of their compensation is based on the delinquency performance of their accounts. The delinquency bucket segmentation approach allows us to assign our more skilled collectors to the later-stage delinquent accounts.

Our collection activities typically begin with customer contact when a payment becomes five days past due and continue throughout the delinquency period. We utilize a predictive dialer that automates outbound telephone dialing. The dialer is primarily used to focus on and reduce the number of accounts that are between 10 and 30 days delinquent. A collection notice is normally sent once an account initially falls five days delinquent and then once an account reaches the 31- to 60-day delinquency stage, the 61- to 75-day delinquency stage, the 76- to 90-day delinquency stage and the over 90-day delinquency stage. Collectors input notes directly into our servicing system, enabling the collectors to monitor the status of problem accounts and promptly take any necessary actions. In addition, late charges are assessed when a leasing customer fails to remit payment on a lease by its due date. If the lease continues to be delinquent, we may exercise our remedies under the terms of the contract, including acceleration of the entire lease balance, litigation and/or repossession. 
 In addition, the collections department also focuses on collecting delinquent late fees, property taxes, and other outstanding amounts due under customers contracts. 
 Generally, after an account becomes 120 days or more past due, it is charged-off and referred to our internal recovery group, consisting of a team of paralegals and collectors. The group utilizes several resources in order to maximize recoveries on charged-off accounts, including: (1) initiating litigation against the end user customer and any personal guarantor, using our internal legal staff; (2) referring the account to an outside law firm or collection agency; and/or (3) repossessing and remarketing the equipment through third parties. 
 At the end of the initial lease term, on fair market value leases, a customer may return the equipment, continue leasing the equipment or purchase the equipment under the guidelines set forth in the purchase option granted to the customer. Our end of term department maintains a team of employees who seek to realize our recorded residual in the leased equipment at the end of the lease term. 
 Supervision and Regulation 
 Although most states do not directly regulate the commercial equipment lease financing business, certain states require lenders and finance companies to be licensed, impose limitations on certain contract terms and on interest rates and other charges, mandate disclosure of certain contract terms and constrain collection practices and remedies. Under certain circumstances, we also may be required to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. These acts require, among other things, that we provide notice to credit applicants of their right to receive a written statement of reasons for declined credit applications. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) and similar state statutes or rules that govern telemarketing practices are generally not applicable to our business-to-business calling platform; however, we are subject to the sections of the TCPA that regulate business-to-business facsimiles. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACT Act) requires financial institutions to establish a written program to implement Red Flag Guidelines, which are intended to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft. The FACT Act also provides guidance regarding reasonable policies and procedures that a user of consumer credit reports must employ when a consumer reporting agency sends the user a notice of address discrepancy. 
 Our insurance operations are subject to various types of governmental regulation. Our wholly-owned insurance company subsidiary, AssuranceOne, is a Class 3 Bermuda insurance company and, as such, is subject to the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978, as amended, and related regulations. 
 Banking Regulation. On January 13, 2009, the Company became a bank holding company and is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act and supervised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. On September 15, 2010, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia confirmed the effectiveness of the Companys election to become a financial holding company (while remaining a bank holding company) pursuant to Sections 4(k) and (l) of the Bank Holding Company Act and Section 225.82 of the Federal Reserve Boards Regulation Y. Such election permits the Company to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity, including the maintenance and expansion of our reinsurance activities conducted through AssuranceOne.

Since its opening on March 12, 2008, MBB has been operating in accordance with the agreement entered into with the FDIC on March 20, 2007 (the FDIC Agreement) and in accordance with certain requirements and conditions applicable during its three-year de novo period, as well as requirements and conditions applicable thereafter. MBBs three-year de novo period expired on March 12, 2011, as did certain of the requirements and conditions that were applicable solely during such period. 
 MBB is also subject to comprehensive federal and state regulations dealing with a wide variety of subjects, including reserve requirements, loan limitations, requirements governing the establishment of branches and numerous other aspects of its operations. These regulations generally have been adopted to protect depositors and creditors rather than shareholders. All of our subsidiaries may be subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board even if not otherwise regulated by the Federal Reserve Board, subject to certain conditions in the case of functionally regulated subsidiaries, such as broker/dealers and registered investment advisers. 
 Regulations governing the Company and its affiliates restrict extensions of credit by MBB to Marlin Business Services Corp. and, with some exceptions, to other affiliates. For these purposes, extensions of credit include loans and advances to and guarantees and letters of credit on behalf of Marlin Business Services Corp. and such affiliates. These regulations also restrict investments by MBB in the stock or other securities of Marlin Business Services Corp. and the covered affiliates, as well as the acceptance of such stock or other securities as collateral for loans to any borrower, whether or not related to Marlin Business Services Corp. 
 Additional Activities. Bank holding companies and their banking and non-banking subsidiaries have traditionally been limited to the business of banking and activities which are closely related thereto. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act) expanded the provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act by including a section that permits bank holding companies to become financial holding companies (which we did effective September 15, 2010, while remaining a bank holding company) and permits them to engage in a full range of financial activities. A financial holding company is permitted to engage in a wide variety of activities deemed to be financial in nature including lending, exchanging, transferring, investing for others, or safeguarding money or securities, providing financial, investment or economic advisory services and underwriting, dealing in, or making a market in securities. 
 Capital Adequacy. New capital adequacy standards adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies established new minimum capital requirements for the Company and MBB effective on January 1, 2015. Under the risk-based capital requirements applicable to them, bank holding companies must maintain a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (including the asset equivalent of certain off-balance sheet activities such as acceptances and letters of credit) of not less than 8% (10% in order to be considered well-capitalized). The new requirements include a 6% minimum Tier 1 risk-based ratio (8% to be considered well-capitalized). Tier 1 Capital consists of common stock, related surplus, retained earnings, qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of certain consolidated subsidiaries, after deducting goodwill and certain other intangibles. The remainder of total capital (Tier 2 Capital) may consist of certain perpetual debt securities, mandatory convertible debt securities, hybrid capital instruments and limited amounts of subordinated debt, qualifying preferred stock, allowance for credit losses on loans and leases, allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures and unrealized gains on equity securities. At December 31, 2016, the Companys Tier 1 Capital and total capital ratios were 19.37% and 20.62%, respectively. 
 The new capital standards require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The capital requirements also now require a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio with a required minimum of 4.5% (6.5% to be considered well-capitalized). The Federal Reserve Boards guidelines also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore, the guidelines indicate that the Federal Reserve Board will continue to consider a tangible tier 1 leverage ratio (i.e., after deducting all intangibles) in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. MBB is subject to similar capital standards. At December 31, 2016, the Companys leverage and common equity ratios were 18.36% and 19.37%, respectively.

The Company is required to have a level of regulatory capital in excess of the regulatory minimum and to have a capital buffer above 1.25% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018, and 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter. If a banking organization does not maintain capital above the minimum plus the capital conservation buffer it may be subject to restrictions on dividends, share buybacks, and certain discretionary payments such as bonus payments. 
 On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board approved a final rule to help ensure banking organizations maintain strong capital positions that will enable them to continue lending to creditworthy households and businesses even after unforeseen losses and during severe economic downturns. The final rule minimizes the burden on smaller, less complex financial institutions. It establishes an integrated regulatory capital framework that addresses shortcomings in capital requirements, particularly for larger, internationally active banking organizations, that became apparent during the recent financial crisis. The rule implemented in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act). The final rule was effective January 1, 2014 and phased in over a multiple-year period, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019. 
 Under the final rule, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. In addition, for the largest, most internationally active banking organizations, the final rule includes a new minimum supplementary leverage ratio that takes into account off-balance sheet exposures. The rule establishes new criteria for instruments that will qualify as common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital; adjusts thresholds for the prompt corrective action capital categories and adds in the common equity tier 1 capital ratio to the prompt corrective action thresholds; places limits on distributions or discretionary bonus payments based on the size of the financial institutions capital conservation buffer and retained income; and establishes revised risk weights and credit conversion factors for certain loans and equity exposures. 
 Prompt Corrective Action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires federal regulators to take prompt corrective action against any undercapitalized institution. Five capital categories have been established under federal banking regulations: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Well-capitalized institutions significantly exceed the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. Adequately capitalized institutions include depository institutions that meet but do not significantly exceed the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. Undercapitalized institutions consist of those that fail to meet the required minimum level for one or more relevant capital measures. Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions consist of those with capital levels significantly below the minimum requirements for any relevant capital measure. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are those with minimal capital and at serious risk for government seizure. 
 Under certain circumstances, a well-capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category. A depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions, including paying dividends, or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Institutions that are adequately capitalized but not well-capitalized cannot accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the FDIC and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions may not accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits. 
 The federal bank regulatory agencies are permitted or, in certain cases, required to take certain actions with respect to institutions falling within one of the three undercapitalized categories. Depending on the level of an institutions capital, the agencys corrective powers include, among other things: 
 

 | prohibiting the payment of principal and interest on subordinated debt;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prohibiting the holding company from making distributions without prior regulatory approval;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
-14- 
 

 | placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | placing additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | in the most severe cases, appointing a conservator or receiver for the institution.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan and such a plan will not be accepted unless, among other things, the banking institutions holding company guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a depository institutions holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy. MBBs Tier 1 Capital balance was $130.7 million at December 31, 2016, resulting in a Tier 1 leverage ratio, common equity Tier 1 risk based ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a total risk-based capital ratio of 15.31%, 15.95%, 15.95% and 17.20%, respectively, which exceeded the regulatory requirements for well-capitalized status of 5%, 6.5%, 8% and 10%, respectively. 
 Pursuant to the FDIC Agreement entered into in conjunction with the opening of MBB, MBB must keep its total risk-based capital ratio above 15%. MBBs total risk-based capital ratio of 17.20% at December 31, 2016 exceeded the threshold for well-capitalized status under the applicable laws and regulations, and also exceeded the 15% minimum total risk-based capital ratio required in the FDIC Agreement. 
 The federal banking agencies final regulatory capital rules, discussed above, also modify the above prompt corrective action requirements to add a common equity tier 1 risk-based ratio requirement, and increase certain other capital requirements for the various prompt corrective action thresholds. For example, the requirements for a bank to be considered well-capitalized under the rules are a 5.0% tier 1 leverage ratio, a 6.5% common equity tier 1 risk-based ratio, an 8.0% tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 10.0% total risk-based capital ratio. To be adequately capitalized, those ratios are 4.0%, 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. These changes took effect for the Company on January 1, 2015. 
 Federal Deposit Insurance. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), the FDIC changed its risk-based premium system for FDIC deposit insurance, providing for quarterly assessments of FDIC-insured institutions based on their respective rankings in one of four risk categories depending upon their examination ratings and capital ratios. Beginning in 2011, the FDIC assessment base changed from total domestic deposits to consolidated total assets minus tangible equity capital, defined as Tier 1 Capital. Institutions in FDIC-assigned Risk Categories II, III and IV are assessed premiums at progressively higher rates. 
 On July 21, 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law, which, in part, (1) required the FDIC to increase reserves for the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF) against future losses which will necessitate increased deposit insurance premiums that are to be borne primarily by institutions with assets greater than $10 billion and (2) permanently raised the standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000. To bolster the DIF, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for a new minimum reserve ratio of not less than 1.35% of estimated insured deposits and requires that the FDIC take steps necessary to attain this 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. The FDIC is required by law to offset the effect on institutions with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets of increasing the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. In April 2016, the Board of Directors of the FDIC approved a final rule that amends the way small banks are assessed for deposit insurance, affecting banks with less than $10 billion in assets that have been FDIC insured for at least five years. Changes in the rules include a revised methodology that the FDIC uses to determine risk-based assessments to better reflect risks and assign insurance assessments based on those risks. This final rule was implemented starting in the third quarter of 2016. These changes took effect at the same time rates were reduced for small banks due to hitting the 1.15 percent ratio.

Source of Strength Doctrine. Under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as Federal Reserve Board policy and regulation, a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and is expected to stand prepared to commit resources to support each of them. Consistent with this policy, the Federal Reserve Board has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company should generally not maintain a given rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the organizations capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. 
 USA Patriot Act of 2001. A major focus of governmental policy applicable to financial institutions in recent years has been the effort to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act) was enacted to strengthen the ability of the U.S. law enforcement and intelligence communities to achieve this goal. The Patriot Act requires financial institutions, including our banking subsidiary, to assist in the prevention, detection and prosecution of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The Patriot Act established standards to be followed by institutions in verifying client identification when accounts are opened and provides rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement organizations in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. 
 Privacy. Title V of the GLB Act is intended to increase the level of privacy protection afforded to customers of financial institutions, including customers of the securities and insurance affiliates of such institutions, partly in recognition of the increased cross-marketing opportunities created by the GLB Acts elimination of many of the boundaries previously separating various segments of the financial services industry. Among other things, these provisions require institutions to have in place administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to a customer. 
 Future Legislation. From time to time, legislation will be introduced in Congress and state legislatures with respect to the regulation of financial institutions. The financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 resulted in U.S. government and regulatory agencies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. The U.S. government intervened on an unprecedented scale by temporarily enhancing the liquidity support available to financial institutions, establishing a CP funding facility, temporarily guaranteeing money market funds and certain types of debt issuances, increasing insurance on bank deposits, among other things, and by passing the Dodd-Frank Act, a sweeping financial reform bill. 
 These programs have subjected financial institutions to additional restrictions, oversight and costs. In addition, new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry, impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of compensation, interest rates and financial product offerings and disclosures, among other things. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. We cannot determine the ultimate effect that potential legislation, if enacted, or any regulations issued to implement it, would have on the Company or MBB. 
 National Monetary Policy. In addition to being affected by general economic conditions, the earnings and growth of the Company and MBB are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.

The monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our future business, earnings and growth cannot be predicted. 
 Dividends. The Federal Reserve Board has issued policy statements which provide that, as a general matter, insured banks and bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. For state-chartered banks which are members of the Federal Reserve System, such as MBB, the approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required for the payment of dividends by the bank subsidiary in any calendar year if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in that calendar year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds the current years net income combined with the retained net income for the two preceding calendar years. Retained net income for any period means the net income for that period less any common or preferred stock dividends declared in that period. Moreover, no dividends may be paid by such bank in excess of its undivided profits account. 
 Transfers of Funds and Transactions with Affiliates. Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and applicable regulations impose restrictions on MBB that limit the transfer of funds by MBB to Marlin Business Services Corp. and certain of its affiliates, in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments or purchases of assets. These transfers by MBB to Marlin Business Services Corp. or any other single affiliate are limited in amount to 10% of MBBs capital and surplus, and transfers to all affiliates are limited in the aggregate to 20% of MBBs capital and surplus. These loans and extensions of credit are also subject to various collateral requirements. Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and applicable regulations also require generally that MBBs transactions with its affiliates be on terms no less favorable to MBB than comparable transactions with unrelated third parties. 
 Restrictions on Ownership. Subject to certain exceptions, the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring control of a bank holding company unless the FDIC has been notified 60 days prior to such acquisition and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption in the Change in Bank Control Act, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the 1934 Act, such as the Company, would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of control of the bank holding company. The regulations provide a procedure for challenging this rebuttable control presumption. 
 We believe that we currently are in substantial compliance with all material statutes and regulations that are applicable to our business. 
 Competition 
 We compete with a variety of equipment financing sources that are available to small and mid-sized businesses, including: 
 

 | national, regional and local finance companies that provide leases and loan products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | financing through captive finance and leasing companies affiliated with major equipment manufacturers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | working capital lenders, often referred to as FinTech companies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | corporate credit cards; and
--+----------------------------


 | commercial banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our principal competitors in the small-ticket equipment leasing market are independent finance companies, local and regional banks and, to a lesser extent, in the case of our national accounts channels, national providers 
 
-17- 
 
 of equipment lease financing, some of which are national banks with leasing divisions. Many of our national competitors are substantially larger than we are and generally focus on larger ticket transactions and in some cases international programs. We compete on the quality of service we provide to our origination sources and end user customers. With the introduction of our working capital solution, Funding Stream, we also compete with FinTech lenders. We have encountered and will continue to encounter significant competition. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we employed 318 people. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced any work stoppages.
