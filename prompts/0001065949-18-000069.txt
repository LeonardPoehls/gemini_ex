ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
GENERAL
 
The following is a summary of some of the information contained in this document. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this document to “our Company,” “us,” “we,” “our,” “Mining Power Group,” “Rich Cigars” or the “Company” are to Mining Power Group, Inc.
CORPORATE OVERVIEW AND HISTORY OF MINING POWER GROUP, INC.
 
We were incorporated on July 29, 2013 under the laws of the state of Florida. Originally Rich Cigars, Inc. was established to manufacture and distribute cigars under the Rich Cigars brand name. The Company continually sought to create cigars that appealed to aficionados of high-quality, hand-rolled, premium cigars. One of the founders, Alfred Rushing, has been involved with the cigar industry for more than 20 years. The Company intended to introduce new styles of premium cigars, contracted with a Nicaraguan supplier for the manufacture of hand rolled cigars, which would be distributed and sold principally in the U.S. However, as the consolidated financial statements of the Company for fiscal year 2017 demonstrate, the Company has not been successful in generating adequate revenues in order to generate a net profit or a positive cashflow.

As the result of a change of control of the Company on November 27, 2017, it was decided to wind down the cigar business over the coming months and have the Company enter into new, unrelated business areas. Until the new business strategies are ready for implementation, and a new management team engaged, Richard Davis, sole officer and director of the Company, has been retained on an interim basis.
 
As a result of the change in business, the Company redomiciled from Florida to Colorado and in doing so, changed its name to “Intercontinental Technology, Inc.” Under advice of counsel, on December 26, 2017, the Company, re-domiciled to Delaware under the terms and conditions of a Section 251(g) reorganization under Delaware General Corporation law (the “Reorganization”), and future adjusted its name to “First Intercontinental Technology, Inc.” due the unavailability of the name “Intercontinental Technology, Inc.” in the State of Delaware. The Reorganization was subsequently annulled and vitiated by the Company in February 2018, and the Company returned to Colorado under its current name “Mining Power Group, Inc.” and filed amended and restated Articles of Incorporation (collectively, the “February Corporate Changes”). The February Corporate Changes were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K on February 26, 2018.
 
On January 31, 2018, the Company purchased the proprietary, intellectual property assets, including patents and patents pending rights in nine (9) countries of Simple Cork, Inc., a Florida corporation, with the intent of development the assets into commercial products under the brand name, Simple Cork™ (the “Asset Purchase”). Terms of the Asset Purchase and its material documents were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K on February 6, 2018.
 
“Simple Cork™” represents a family of self-contained devices designed to revolutionize the opening of wine bottles sealed with a cork or a cork-like closure. Each product in the family provides a new level of customer convenience for wine customers and an elegant closure that represents a competitive advantage to wineries using it
 
Each device is comprised of a cork opener apparatus embedded into a cork or food-grade composite substrate which, in the primary version, has retractable, folding telescoping handles for efficient cork - pulling. It simplifies the act of opening a wine bottle in a safer and more secure way without depending on external devices such as cork-screws. Simple Cork™ makes obsolete the traditional cork screw opener, and also eliminates the risk of breaking the cork in the process and having cork pieces fall into the wine in the bottle – a common problem with cork-screws.
 
The strategic intent of the Company is to complete the development of the proprietary patent-protected Simple Cork™ product line during 2018-2019, with primary market introductions of the product line in the U.S. and Europe in 2019.
 
In February 2018 the Company announced that as a short-term strategy to generate revenue while the Company completes the development of Simple Cork™ and makes further investment in it, it would enter the burgeoning cryptomining business.
 
“Cryptomining” is the fundamental methodology of earning and/or creating digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and others, through the use of dedicated, specialized mining machines that perform complex mathematical functions to mine a cryptocurrency and also process cryptocurrency transactions. These machines operate 24-hours per day, 7-days per week within mining-dedicated, temperature-controlled server centers that provide complete end-to-end technical and other support for “peace of mind” and uninterrupted operation.
 
As a result of the short-term focus on cryptomining, the Company renamed itself “Mining Power Group, Inc.” to accentuate the strategy. At the time of the filing of this report on form 10-K, the Company is exploring additional revenue-generating opportunities.
 
As the Company entered 2018, its legacy cigar business was discontinued as it focused its efforts in the new areas with its remaining inventory being liquidated.
