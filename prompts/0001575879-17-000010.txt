Overview
Caesars Acquisition Company
Caesars Acquisition Company (the "Company," "CAC," "we," "our" and "us"), a Delaware corporation, directly owns 100% of the voting membership units of Caesars Growth Partners, LLC ("CGP LLC"), a Delaware limited liability company and a joint venture between CAC and subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment Corporation ("CEC" or "Caesars Entertainment"). Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ("NASDAQ") under the symbol "CACQ."
CAC serves as CGP LLC's managing member and sole holder of all of its outstanding voting units. CAC's primary asset is its membership interest in CGP LLC and does not have any operations other than through its interest in CGP LLC. Certain subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment hold all of CGP LLC's outstanding non-voting units. 
Asset Purchase Transactions
JCC Holding Company II, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively known as "Harrah's New Orleans"), 3535 LV Corp. (formerly known as "The Quad" and recently rebranded as "The LINQ Hotel & Casino"), indirect subsidiaries of Parball Corporation (collectively known as "Bally's Las Vegas") and Corner Investment Company, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively known as "The Cromwell") were direct wholly-owned subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc. ("CEOC"). 
On May 5, 2014, Caesars Growth Properties Holdings, LLC ("CGPH," an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CGP LLC), acquired through one or more subsidiaries (i) The Cromwell, The LINQ Hotel & Casino, and Bally's Las Vegas, (ii) 50% of the ongoing management fees and any termination fees payable under the property management agreements entered between a property manager and the owners of each of these properties, and (iii) certain intellectual property that is specific to each of these properties (collectively referred to as the "First Closing" or "Acquired Properties Transaction"). On May 5, 2014, CGP LLC contributed the equity interests of PHWLV, LLC ("PHWLV") and a 50% interest in the management fee revenues of PHW Manager, LLC ("PHW Manager") to CGPH.
On May 20, 2014, CGPH through one or more subsidiaries acquired (i) Harrah's New Orleans, (ii) 50% of the ongoing management fees and any termination fees payable under the Louisiana property management agreement entered between a property manager and the owners of Harrah's New Orleans and (iii) certain intellectual property that is specific to Harrah's New Orleans (the "Second Closing" or "Harrah's Transaction"). 
In connection with the Acquired Properties Transaction and the Harrah's Transaction (collectively, the "Asset Purchase Transactions"), CGPH and Caesars Growth Properties Finance, Inc. issued $675.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.375% second-priority senior secured notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes"). On May 8, 2014, CGPH closed on $1.175 billion of term loans (the "CGPH Term Loan") and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement. 
Proposed Merger of CAC with CEC
On December 21, 2014, the Company and CEC entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, CAC will merge with and into CEC, with CEC as the surviving company (the "Proposed Merger").
On July 9, 2016, CAC and CEC agreed to amend and restate the Merger Agreement (the "Amended Merger Agreement"). In connection with the entry into the Amended Merger Agreement, on July 9, 2016, (i) CAC and CEOC, a majority owned subsidiary of CEC, agreed to amend and restate the Restructuring Support Agreement (as amended, the "CAC RSA"), dated as of June 12, 2016, among CAC, CEOC and CEC; (ii) CEC and CEOC agreed to amend the Restructuring Support, Settlement and Contribution Agreement, dated as of June 7, 2016 (as amended, the "CEC RSA" and, together with the CAC RSA, the "Caesars RSAs"), between CEC and CEOC; and (iii) CAC entered into a Voting Agreement (the "Voting Agreement") with Hamlet Holdings LLC ("Hamlet Holdings"), and solely with respect to certain provisions of the Voting Agreement, affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC and TPG Capital, LP and certain of their co-investors (collectively, the "Holders"). The Caesars RSAs were entered into with respect to the restructuring of CEOC's indebtedness (the "Restructuring") and, together with the Amended Merger Agreement, are consistent with the terms proposed under the second amended Joint Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (as amended, the "Merger Plan") of CEOC and each of the debtors (together with CEOC, the "Debtors") in the CEOC Chapter 11 Cases.
The exchange ratio, pursuant to which shares of CAC's class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Class A Common Stock") and CAC's class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Class B Common Stock," and together with the Class A Common Stock, the "CAC Common Stock"), will become exchangeable for shares of CEC's common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("CEC Common Stock"), has been amended to ensure that holders of CAC Common Stock immediately 
 3

prior to the closing of the Proposed Merger (the "Merger Closing") will receive 27% of the outstanding CEC Common Stock on a fully diluted basis (prior to conversion of the new CEC convertible notes) (and which, upon conversion at any time following the Merger Closing, will result in pro rata dilution to all holders of CEC Common Stock, including holders of CAC Common Stock immediately prior to the Merger Closing) (the "Exchange Ratio"). The Exchange Ratio may be adjusted pursuant to the Amended Merger Agreement and such adjustment will be determined on the earlier of (i) the date on which the special committee of CAC's Board of Directors (the "CAC Special Committee") and the special committee of CEC's Board of Directors (the "CEC Special Committee"), each composed solely of independent directors, agree in writing as to the Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the sixth business day following the date on which the Adjustment Period (as described below) ends.
The Adjustment Period is the 14 day period beginning on the date, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of the Amended Merger Agreement, on which each of CAC and CEC has received written confirmation from the other party that it and its respective representatives have received certain information (which information must be provided on request as soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than 30 days following the confirmation date) necessary for such party's financial advisor to render a fairness opinion. During the Adjustment Period, the CAC Special Committee, on behalf of CAC, and the CEC Special Committee, on behalf of CEC, will determine whether and to what extent it is necessary, appropriate and advisable to adjust the Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio may be adjusted solely to take into account certain tax costs and tax attributes (except as described below).
If at any time during the Adjustment Period the CAC Special Committee or the CEC Special Committee determines that (i) it cannot obtain a fairness opinion from its respective financial advisor as a result of an adjustment to the Exchange Ratio based solely on the factors set forth in the Amended Merger Agreement or (ii) an adjustment to the Exchange Ratio based solely on the factors set forth in the Amended Merger Agreement would not be advisable or would otherwise be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law, either the CAC Special Committee or the CEC Special Committee may notify the other party of such determination and, following delivery of such notice, the parties will instead take into account all other relevant facts and circumstances impacting the intrinsic value of CAC and CEC at such time.
If the CAC Special Committee, on behalf of CAC, or the CEC Special Committee, on behalf of CEC, (i) are unable to agree to an adjustment to the Exchange Ratio by the end of the Adjustment Period and determine in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to terminate the Amended Merger Agreement would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the directors of CAC or CEC, as applicable, under applicable law or (ii) have not received, as of a date that is reasonably proximate to the date on which the Adjustment Period ends, an opinion of an independent, nationally recognized financial advisor to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in preparing such opinion as set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to CAC or CEC, as applicable, then the Amended Merger Agreement may be terminated within five business days following the end of the Adjustment Period.
The Amended Merger Agreement also contains an amended "Go-Shop" provision on terms substantially the same as the "Go-Shop" provision originally set forth in the Merger Agreement. The Amended Merger Agreement also provides that (i) certain existing litigation, under specified circumstances, (ii) certain legislative changes and (iii) any change in the financial or securities markets or in the market price or valuation of any security or financial interest, or in the business, results of operations or prospects of either of CAC or CEC, subject to certain conditions, in each case will not provide cause for either the CAC board of directors (the "CAC Board") or the CEC board of directors (the "CEC Board") to effect an adverse recommendation change.
The Amended Merger Agreement was fully negotiated by and between the CAC Special Committee and the CEC Special Committee, was recommended by each of the CAC Special Committee and the CEC Special Committee and was approved by the CAC Board and the CEC Board. Stockholders of each of CAC and CEC will be asked to vote on the adoption of the Amended Merger Agreement at special meetings of CAC's stockholders and CEC's stockholders, respectively, that will each be held on a date to be announced. Pursuant to the Amended Merger Agreement, CAC and CEC, as applicable, have agreed to file a joint proxy statement/prospectus as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of the Amended Merger Agreement.
The closing of the merger is subject to the adoption of the Amended Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding shares of CAC Common Stock and CEC Common Stock, respectively. In addition to the closing conditions originally set forth in the Merger Agreement, each of CAC and CEC have agreed that their respective obligation to consummate the merger is subject to the fulfillment of the Merger Plan containing the Debtor Release, the Third-Party Release and the Exculpation. However, the Amended Merger Agreement eliminated from the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (i) minimum cash closing conditions for both parties and (ii) a closing condition that limited tax costs relating to the Restructuring to close the Proposed Merger.
The Amended Merger Agreement provides certain termination rights to each of CAC and CEC based on, among other things: (i) CEOC filing (including any of its debtor subsidiaries), without CAC's or CEC's prior written consent, respectively (x) a plan of reorganization, a disclosure statement or a proposed order entered by the Bankruptcy Court confirming the Merger 
 4

Plan that is materially consistent with the RSAs and the Merger Plan and otherwise acceptable to each of CAC and CEC ("Confirmation Order") that does not include the Debtor Release, the Third-Party Release or the Exculpation as to CAC, CGP LLC, their subsidiaries, and their respective representatives ("CAC Released Parties") or CEC, its subsidiaries, and their respective representatives ("CEC Released Parties"), respectively, in form and substance consistent in all material respects with such provisions as set forth in the Merger Plan or (y) any motion, pleading or other document with the Bankruptcy Court in the CEOC Chapter 11 Cases that is otherwise materially inconsistent with the CAC RSA or CEC RSA, respectively, or the Merger Plan, (ii) the Confirmation Order (x) not including the Debtor Release, the Third-Party Release or the Exculpation as to the CAC Released Parties or the CEC Released Parties, respectively, in form and substance consistent in all material respect with such provisions as set forth in the Merger Plan or (y) not being otherwise materially consistent with the Merger Plan, (iii) the 105 Injunction Order no longer being in effect or, subject to certain conditions, CEOC failing to file a motion on or before August 14, 2016, or such earlier date as may be required by local rules governing the CEOC Chapter 11 Cases for the filing of such motion, seeking to extend the 105 Injunction Order currently in effect to the period ending on the confirmation date, (iv) either of the Caesars RSAs being terminated or becoming null and void or (v) the date on which the merger becomes effective not occurring by the close of business on December 31, 2017.
Caesars Growth Partners, LLC
CAC's primary asset is its interest in CGP LLC.
CGP LLC is a casino asset and entertainment company. Subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment own all of the outstanding non-voting units of CGP LLC and are the majority economic owners of CGP LLC. Through its relationship with Caesars Entertainment, CGP LLC has the ability to access Caesars Entertainment's proven management expertise, brand equity, Total Rewards loyalty program and structural synergies.
CGP LLC's Interactive Entertainment business consists of two operating units: The World Series of Poker and regulated online real money gaming. CGP LLC's Casino Properties and Developments include Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas ("Planet Hollywood"), The LINQ Hotel & Casino, Bally's Las Vegas, The Cromwell, Horseshoe Baltimore Casino ("Horseshoe Baltimore"), Harrah's New Orleans, and a 50% interest in the management fee paid in connection with the management agreements for each of these properties.
New investment and acquisition opportunities, except for any expansion, add-on or additional investment in respect of any existing gaming property of CGP LLC or its subsidiaries, or except for any potential future investment or acquisition by Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Inc. are required to be submitted to Caesars Entertainment. A committee of the board of directors of Caesars Entertainment comprised of disinterested directors will make the determination on behalf of Caesars Entertainment to (1) pursue any potential projects itself or (2) decline the project for itself, after which CGP LLC may elect or decline to pursue the project. The Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of CGP LLC (the "CGP Operating Agreement") includes a framework with respect to the structuring of compensation related to future projects between Caesars Entertainment and CGP LLC. In the event Caesars Entertainment declines an opportunity and CGP LLC undertakes the opportunity, CGP LLC is expected to retain a 50% interest in the management fee to be received by Caesars Entertainment, unless otherwise agreed, and CGP LLC will acquire 100% of the new investment opportunity.
Caesars Enterprise Services, LLC ("CES"), a services joint venture among CEOC, Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, LLC ("CERP"), a subsidiary of Caesars Entertainment, and the Company, (together the "Members" and each a "Member") manages CGP LLC's properties and provides CGP LLC with access to Caesars Entertainment's management expertise, intellectual property, back office services and Total Rewards loyalty program. CES also employs personnel under each property's corresponding property management agreement.
CES manages certain enterprise assets which include all intellectual property currently used, or contemplated to be used, in connection with the properties owned by CEOC, CERP and CGP LLC and their respective affiliates, including any and all intellectual property related to the Total Rewards program. On October 1, 2014, CES began operations in Nevada, Louisiana and certain other jurisdictions in which regulatory approval had been received or was not required, including through the commencement of direct employment by CES of certain designated enterprise-wide employees. CES also manages other assets it owns, licenses or controls, and employs certain of the corresponding employees and other employees who previously provided services to CEOC, CERP and CGP LLC, their affiliates and their respective properties and systems under each property's corresponding property management agreement. Operating expenses are allocated to each Member with respect to their respective properties serviced by CES in accordance with historical allocation methodologies, subject to annual revisions and certain prefunding requirements. Corporate expenses that are not allocated to the properties directly are allocated by CES to CEOC, CERP, and CGPH according to their allocation percentages (initially 70.0%, 24.6% and 5.4%, respectively), subject to annual review. As a result of an annual review undertaken in September 2015 but effective July 2015, the allocation percentages of CES members, CEOC, CERP and CGPH were revised to 65.4%, 21.8% and 12.8%, respectively. CGPH notified CES, CEOC and CERP that it objected to the September 2015 expense allocation but would pay the revised expense allocations under protest and reserved all rights. As a result of an annual review undertaken in August 2016 but effective January 2017, the allocation 
 5

percentages for CEOC, CERP and CGPH were revised to 62.9%, 22.9% and 14.2%, respectively. CGPH notified CES, CEOC and CERP that it objects to the August 2016 expense allocation but will pay the revised expense allocations under protest and reserves all rights. 
On May 20, 2014, the Members entered into an Omnibus License and Enterprise Services Agreement (the "Omnibus Agreement"), which granted licenses to the Members and certain of their affiliates in connection with the formation of CES. Pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement, CGP LLC has access to Caesars Entertainment's leading brand portfolio and management expertise and expects to benefit from its corporate scale, which CGP LLC believes provides a competitive advantage in the operation of CGP LLC's properties. CGP LLC also benefits from management agreements that CGP LLC entered into with management company subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment, which were subsequently assigned to CES. CGP LLC also participates in Caesars Entertainment's industry-leading customer loyalty program, Total Rewards. CGP LLC uses the Total Rewards system to market promotions and to generate customer play within CGP LLC's properties.
Interactive Entertainment
On September 23, 2016, Caesars Interactive Entertainment, LLC ("CIE" or "Caesars Interactive", formerly Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Inc.), a subsidiary of CGP LLC, sold its social and mobile games business (the "SMG Business") for $4.4 billion subject to customary purchase price adjustments. In connection with the SMG Business sale and related restructuring, CIE retained its World Series of Poker ("WSOP") and regulated online real money gaming ("RMG") businesses. CIE also granted an exclusive, royalty bearing license to Playtika, Ltd. ("Playtika"), a former CIE subsidiary constituting part of the sold SMG Business, with respect to the WSOP and other WSOP-related trademarks owned by CIE or its affiliates and an exclusive royalty bearing sublicense with respect to certain trademarks for continued use in Playtika's social and mobile games business. In connection with the SMG Business sale, CIE repurchased, immediately prior to the closing of the sale of the SMG Business (the "SMG Business Sale Closing"), all of the shares of CIE common stock held by Rock Gaming Interactive LLC and by CIE's other minority investors (collectively, the "Minority Investors") and CIE became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CGP LLC. Details of CIE's two continuing operating units follow below.
Regulated Online Real Money Gaming. CIE has built a foundation for a regulated United States ("U.S.") online real money gaming business. CIE obtained a license in Nevada in December 2012 to operate online poker and launched WSOP.com in September 2013. A subsidiary of CIE applied for and received its internet gaming permit and launched online poker and online casino games in New Jersey in November 2013 under the WSOP, Caesars and Harrah's brands. CIE is actively participating in a U.S. lobbying effort for other states to follow Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey's lead.
While online real money gaming has not been legalized at the Federal level, Nevada has approved interactive gaming regulations allowing for intrastate online poker, and Delaware and New Jersey have each passed online real money gaming laws for both poker and casino games. In February 2014, Nevada and Delaware leaders signed the Multi-State Internet Gaming Agreement establishing a legal framework for the first authorized interstate Internet gambling, which launched in March 2015.
The World Series of Poker. The WSOP, which was founded in 1970, is the world's largest annual poker event and organizer of the most-attended regional poker tour. The flagship WSOP tournament series in Las Vegas had 107,833 entries, an event record, and awarded over $221 million in prize money in 2016. The 2016-17 WSOP Circuit is expected to include 22 scheduled stops at casinos throughout North America and 14 international stops. Since 2007, the WSOP has staged at least one international event series per year in venues including Paris, San Paulo and Melbourne. The WSOP benefits from a television programming rights agreement with ESPN through 2017 and sponsorship agreements with a number of leading brands.
Products 
Regulated Online Real Money Gaming 
In Nevada, CIE received its operator's license in December 2012 and launched WSOP.com in September 2013. In November 2013, CIE launched three regulated online real money gaming websites in New Jersey that use and promote the Caesars, Harrah's and WSOP brands: CaesarsCasino.com, HarrahsCasino.com and WSOP.com.
CIE's real money gaming software license agreements with 888 Atlantic Limited ("888") and NYX Gaming Group ("NYX") underpin its operations and preparation for further legalized real money gaming in the United States. 888 provides front and back office services for CIE's U.S. poker offerings, allowing CIE to focus on its strengths in branding and marketing, including the online acquisition and retention of customers. CIE operates WSOP.com in Nevada and WSOP.com and HarrahsCasino.com in New Jersey on 888's platform, and operates CaesarsCasino.com in New Jersey on the NYX casino platform. The combination of these agreements provides CIE with two software alternatives and the ability to employ a multi-brand and multi-platform strategy.
The World Series of Poker
CIE markets the WSOP brand through three distinct avenues: live events, licensing and sponsorships.
 6

Live Events. The signature WSOP live event, the WSOP Las Vegas, was established in 1970 and has occurred annually at the Rio Hotel and Casino ("Rio") in Las Vegas for twelve consecutive years, with an arrangement for the tournament to stay at the Rio through 2017. The 46th annual WSOP Las Vegas event in 2016 drew 107,833 entries from 107 different countries to the 69 events at the Rio to compete in the official WSOP "Gold Bracelet" events.
Since 2005, the WSOP Las Vegas has been complemented by a regular traveling tour of WSOP-branded poker tournaments running from August to May each year (the "WSOP Circuit Events") which culminates in a season-ending National Championship. In the 2015-16 season, the WSOP tour was linked globally for the first time, allowing qualifiers from the U.S. circuit to compete with those on the international circuit for the National Championship. The 2015-16 WSOP Circuit included 19 scheduled stops at casinos throughout North America and six international stops. The 2016-17 WSOP Circuit is expected to include 22 scheduled stops at casinos throughout North America and 14 international stops.
CIE's current contract with ESPN provides that the WSOP Las Vegas will be carried on ESPN and ESPN2 through 2017, with at least 32 hours of original programming annually. CIE receives advertising air-time within all aired episodes on every ESPN platform. ESPN's coverage of this season's WSOP began in August 2016 and ran through November 2016 on both ESPN and ESPN2, concluding coverage with a three-day live final table format.
Since 2007, the WSOP has organized at least one international series per year under the WSOP Europe or WSOP Asia-Pacific brands. The 2017 WSOP Europe will take place at King's Casino in Rozvadov, Czech Republic in October 2017 in what is now the largest live poker room in Europe. The 2016 WSOP Europe took place in Monte Carlo, Monaco. The 2015 WSOP Europe took place at Spielbank Casino in Berlin, Germany in October 2015 and was well-received and attended in its first time in Germany. The first two WSOP Asia-Pacific events were held in 2013 and 2014 in Melbourne, Australia. 
Licensing. CIE licenses the WSOP brand for consumer products, allowing CIE to expand its brand through mainstream channels. WSOP licensed products, from playing cards and poker chips to lifestyle apparel, are sold at such retailers as Target and Lids. New Jersey runs a notable lottery offering in concert with the WSOP brand and eight states have also sold WSOP branded instant-win lottery tickets since 2009.
CIE also currently licenses the WSOP trademark to an affiliate of 888 for their use in 888's operation of WSOP.co.uk which is a regulated online real money gaming website in the UK primarily focused on poker. In addition, CIE currently licenses the Caesars trademark to Gamesys Limited for their use in the operation of regulated online real money gaming websites, CaesarsCasino.co.uk and CaesarsBingo.co.uk, in the UK which primarily focus on casino and bingo related games, respectively.
Starting in September 2016, CIE grants an exclusive, royalty bearing license to Playtika with respect to the WSOP and other WSOP-related trademarks owned by CIE or its affiliates and an exclusive royalty bearing sublicense with respect to certain trademarks for continued use in Playtika's social and mobile games business.
Sponsorships. CIE annually pursues promotional partnerships with a variety of brands. Event sponsors in 2016 included Black Clover and 888Poker. Event sponsors in 2015 included NJOY, Jostens, Black Clover, GPI and 888poker. These partnerships typically include both rights fees and marketing activities promoting the WSOP brand. 2014 was highlighted by a "Watch and Win" promotion distributed on more than 20 million packages of the Ruffles Brand of potato chips encouraging download of the WSOP social game and tune-in of the ESPN broadcast. CIE has the exclusive rights to sell camera-visible brand placements within its television and live Internet broadcast programming to third-party advertisers. 
Information Technology
Regulated Online Real Money Gaming
888 provides CIE with 888's online gaming platform in addition to a suite of back-office operational services such as customer service, technical support and e-payments. Together with 888, CIE received regulatory certification in Nevada for the September 2013 launch of WSOP.com. 888 provides front and back office services for CIE's United States online real money poker offering for online real money casino under the Harrah's brand in New Jersey.
A subsidiary of CIE and affiliates of NYX entered into a platform and services agreement pursuant to which NYX provides online casino platform services including developing, launching, maintaining and operating its software platforms, in New Jersey in exchange for a share of net gaming revenue for the Caesars Casino brand.
Marketing
We believe the Caesars portfolio of properties (including the CEOC properties) that operate under the Total Rewards program enable us to capture a larger share of our customers' entertainment spending when they travel among markets versus that of a standalone property, which is core to our cross-market strategy. We believe that our high concentration of properties in the center of the Las Vegas Strip generates increased revenues and enables us to capture more of our customers' gaming dollars than in markets where we have single properties competing individually against outside competition. 
 7

We believe the Total Rewards program, in conjunction with this distribution system, allows us to capture a growing share of our customers' entertainment spending and compete more effectively. Members earn Reward Credits at all Caesars-affiliated properties in the United States and Canada for on-property entertainment expenses, including gaming, hotel, dining and retail shopping. Members may also earn Reward Credits through the Total Rewards Visa credit card and can redeem Reward Credits with our many partners, including Starwood Hotels and Resorts and Norwegian Cruise Line. Total Rewards members can redeem Reward Credits for amenities or other items such as merchandise, gift cards, and travel. Total Rewards is structured in tiers (designated as Gold, Platinum, Diamond or Seven Stars), each with increasing member benefits and privileges.
Members are also provided promotional offers and rewards based on their engagement with Caesars-affiliated properties, aspects of their casino gaming play, and their preferred spending choices outside of gaming. Member information is also used for marketing promotions, including direct mail campaigns, electronic mail, our website, mobile devices, social media and interactive slot machines.
With respect to our Interactive Entertainment business, in Nevada and New Jersey, we believe the WSOP database of poker players and Total Rewards database of casino players will be important acquisition channels in addition to traditional techniques such as television and online advertising. CIE's WSOP events are primarily marketed through media features and news coverage.

Offering world-class gaming amenities, the 122,000 square foot casino offers approximately 2,200 slot machines, 180 table games and a WSOP-branded poker room.

Competition
Interactive Entertainment
CIE's competitors include regulated online gaming companies that operate in the U.S., poker tournament creators and other forms of casino and media entertainment.
Casino Properties and Developments
The casino entertainment business is highly competitive and characterized by competitors that vary considerably by their size, quality of facilities, number of operations, brand identities, marketing and growth strategies, financial strength and capabilities, level of amenities, management talent, and geographic diversity. In most markets, including Las Vegas, CGP LLC competes directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas.
 10

The Las Vegas and Louisiana hotel/casino industries are highly competitive. Hotels on the Las Vegas Strip compete with other hotels on and off the Las Vegas Strip, including hotels in downtown Las Vegas, and hotels in Louisiana compete with other hotels in Louisiana and on the Gulf Coast. CGP LLC's Las Vegas Strip hotels and casinos also compete, in part, with each other and other Caesars Entertainment resorts. In recent years, many casino operators have been reinvesting in existing markets to attract new customers or to gain market share, thereby increasing competition in those markets. As companies have completed new expansion projects, supply has typically grown at a faster pace than demand in some markets, including Las Vegas, CGP LLC's largest market, and competition has increased significantly. For example, SLS Las Vegas opened in August 2014 on the northern end of the Strip, and the Genting Group has announced plans to develop a casino and hotel called Resorts World Las Vegas, which is expected to open in 2019 on the northern end of the Strip. Also, in response to changing trends, Las Vegas operators have been focused on expanding their non-gaming offerings, including upgrades to hotel rooms, new food and beverage offerings, and new entertainment offerings. MGM's The Park and joint venture with AEG, T-Mobile Arena, located between New York-New York and Monte Carlo, opened in April 2016 and includes retail and dining options and a 20,000 seat indoor arena for sporting events and concerts. In addition, in June 2016, MGM announced that the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino will undergo $450 million in non-gaming renovations focused on room, food and beverage and entertainment enhancements and is expected to re-open in late 2018 as two newly branded hotels. There have also been proposals for other large scale non-gaming development projects in Las Vegas by various other developers. The expansion of existing casino entertainment properties, the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of CGP LLC's competitors have increased competition in many markets in which they operate, and this intense competition is expected to continue.
In addition, in the mid-Atlantic region, existing casino resorts provide a number of gaming options for customers, thereby creating significant competition for Horseshoe Baltimore. The casino resorts in the mid-Atlantic region compete with each other on the basis of overall atmosphere, range of amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment offered and size. Further, MGM National Harbor in Maryland opened in December 2016 and may draw additional customers away from Horseshoe Baltimore. In addition, in June 2016, Maryland Live! announced plans to invest $200 million to construct a new hotel with additional food and beverage and entertainment options adjacent to its casino.
CGP LLC also competes with legalized gaming from casinos located on Native American tribal lands, primarily those located in California. While the competitive impact on CGP LLC's operations in Las Vegas from the continued growth of Native American gaming establishments in California remains uncertain, the proliferation of gaming in California and other areas located in the same regions as CGP LLC's properties could have an adverse effect on CGP LLC's results of operations.
In addition, certain states have legalized, and others may legalize, casino gaming in specific areas, including metropolitan areas from which CGP LLC traditionally attracts customers. A number of states have permitted or are considering permitting gaming, on Native American reservations and through expansion of state lotteries.
While CGP LLC does not believe it to be the case, some have suggested that internet gaming could create additional competition for CGP LLC and could adversely affect CGP LLC's brick and mortar operations. CGP LLC believes that internet gaming complements brick and mortar operations. CGP LLC also competes with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, with various other entertainment businesses, and with other forms of gaming, such as lotteries.
The current global trend toward liberalization of gaming restrictions and resulting proliferation of gaming venues could result in a decrease in the number of visitors to CGP LLC's Las Vegas facilities by attracting customers close to home and away from Las Vegas, which could have a material adverse effect on CGP LLC's businesses.
Seasonality 
We believe that business at CGP LLC's properties is subject to seasonality based on the weather in the markets in which they operate, and the travel habits of visitors. For instance, visitation is lowest during the winter months; however, volume of business generated by our Las Vegas properties is generally lower during the summer months.
Business in CGP LLC's properties can also fluctuate from time to time due to specific events, such as Chinese New Year, the World Series of Poker tournament (with respect to CGP LLC's Las Vegas Properties), city-wide conventions, Mardi Gras (with respect to Harrah's New Orleans), a sporting event (including, with respect to Harrah's New Orleans, a Super Bowl or a NCAA Final Four Championship) or a concert, or visits by our premium players. Seasonality may cause CGP LLC's working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume and timing of sales. These factors, among other things, make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect CGP LLC's ability to manage working capital and to predict financial results accurately, which could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.

Employees 
As of December 31, 2016, CAC did not have any employees. The employees that work at CGP LLC's casino properties are employees of the respective property where they work. CGP LLC's casino properties had approximately 10,150 employees. Approximately 5,490 employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Governmental Regulation
The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Our gaming facilities and online real money platforms are subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules, and regulations of the jurisdiction in which the gaming facility is located and the online real money platform operates. These laws, rules, and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 10‑K.
Our businesses are subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, construction, land use, and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional discussion.
