The Business of the Company
 
Overview
 
Prior to March 2012, we were a computer and technology hardware reseller to businesses and other organizations. Most of our clients were small and medium sized organizations, although we attempted to market our products and services to larger organizations. We also outsourced technology-related services to provide a full solution basket of technology products and services including hardware, software, network development and services. Our clients consisted of some retail purchasers and small to medium-sized organizations, operating mostly in North America, but we did have occasional clients in Europe. On April 2, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire two separate one-fourth (1/4) working interests (collectively, the “Working Interests”) in certain oil and gas leases covering the Board of Education No. 6 Well located in Yazoo County, Mississippi ("Pickens") from Standard Energy Holdings LLC, an entity under common control. The consideration granted by the Company in exchange

About the Pickens Field
 
The first oil field discovered in Mississippi, the Tinsley field, is located 27 miles to the southwest of the Pickens Field. The Pickens Field was discovered six months later.
 
The Pickens Field is located about 35 miles north of Jackson, Mississippi, in Madison and Yazoo Counties. The field was discovered by Kingwood Oil Company in March of 1940 with the drilling of the R. E. Wilburn No.1, which is located in Section 31 of T12N-R3E, Yazoo County. The R.E. Wilburn was completed open hole in the Eutaw Wilburn sand at a depth of 4878-4889 feet, and initially tested 1013 barrels per day of 40 gravity oil and eventually produced 356,489 barrels of oil over its life time.
 
Pickens Field was discovered six months after the discovery of the Tinsley Field in western Yazoo County, and was the fourth field discovered in Mississippi. Pickens Field has produced 20,441,487 barrels of oil from the Eutaw Wilburn sand, approximately 2,000,000 barrels of oil from the Selma Chalk, and approximately 100,000 barrels of oil from the Tuscaloosa and Lower Cretaceous.
 
The Pickens Field is a ten-mile long northwest-southeast trending fault line trap with up-thrown fault blocks and structural closer. The Selma Chalk and the Tuscaloosa reservoirs are also associated with the same type of trapping mechanisms. Pickens is located near the western end of the Pickens-Gilbertown fault system, which begins west of the Pickens Field, and extends to the southeast through the producing oil regions of Scott, Jasper, and Clarke counties Mississippi, and ending at the Gilbertown Field in Choctaw County, Alabama. This fault system is also located at the northern end of the Mississippi Interior Salt Basin, and has had many oil fields discovered along its trend.
 
Other producing oil fields in the region are the Bentonia and Flora oil fields, which are 21 miles to the southwest. It is believed that an upward movement in the Louann Salt caused a northwest-southeast trending salt ridge, creating an overlying high relief Smackover structure and severe faulting in the shallow reservoirs of the Eutaw and other Cretaceous reservoirs. The high-grade crude oil that has charged the shallower horizons, most likely migrated up the faults from the Smackover structure below.
 
The Selma Chalk Formation. The Texas Oil Company discovered oil in the Selma Chalk formation in March of 1963 with the completion of the Eliza Thomas No.1. This well is located in the SE quarter of Section 29 of T12N-R3E, Yazoo County. The Chalk is a light gray carbonate rock, which is approximately 900 feet thick in the Pickens area. The Chalk is more sandy and permeable in the northwest portion of the field and less permeable in the southeast portion of the field. Up until 1963 the oil produced at the Pickens Field came from the Eutaw. Over the years as Eutaw wells were being drilled, it became common knowledge in the local oil industry as well as drilling contractors that a loss of circulation would sometimes occur when drilling through the Chalk. Also, oil would occasionally appear on the mud pits as drilling mud was circulated back to the surface after drilling through the Chalk section.
 
The Eliza Thomas No.1 was north of the Pickens Field on a separate fault. The Thomas well was originally drilled to 5,415 feet, and then completed in the Selma Chalk in the interval from 4434 to 4454. After acidizing, the well flowed 309 BOPD and no water, with 175 pounds of flowing tubing pressure. The Chalk oil was 37 gravity, similar to the Eutaw. Sidewall cores taken in the Chalk had a slight oil show, which probably led Texaco to complete in the interval.

The John McGowan Company and Clement & Stover subsequently drilled other Chalk wells after the successful completion of the Thomas well. These operators would typically run a Drill Stem Test to see if the Chalk would show oil. This was a fairly successful technique, but was not always an indication of whether a well would be productive or not. McGowan and Clement & Stover, however, completed the more successful wells in the field such as the Varnado, the Livingston and the Bridgforth. Out of the 27 Chalk wells completed at the Pickens Field, the average cumulative production was 65,734 BO. However, the better producers in the field were the H. R. Varnado No. 1, the No. 2 Board of Supervisors, the Stewart Bridgforth No. 2, and the Livingston No. 1. These four wells averaged 263,000 BO per well. Drilling in the more permeable part of the field along with cutting the fault at the optimum depth most likely led to the higher recovery.
 
The No. 2 Board of Supervisors was drilled by Clement & Stover and is located in Section 16 of T12N-2E of Yazoo County. This well was completed in the Chalk open-hole and no log was run. The initial test was 64 BO and 8 BW per day, and produced 287,482 BO cumulatively. This well steadily produced an average of 4472 barrels of oil per month (149 per day) for the first four years before it began to decline. The Clement-Stover/Stewart Bridgforth No. 2 flowed 168 BO and 48 BW per day on the initial test, and produced a total of 213,500 BO. The McGowan/H. R. Varnado No.1 tested 156 BO per day, and produced a total of 440,000 BO cumulatively. The Clement-Stover/Livingston No.1 tested 112 BO and 128 BW per day, and produced a total of 110,000 BO.
 
In March of 1996, G&S Oil Company re-entered the Palmer Petroleum/Bridgforth No.1, and completed in the Selma Chalk from 4180 to 4230. The well flowed 380 BOPD with no water and 225 pounds of tubing pressure. Cumulative oil production is 49,496 barrels. A fault cut the Chalk in the top 150 feet of the section. The pay section shows no SP response and resistivity of 7 ohms. This well did not flow oil until it was acidized with Hydrochloric acid. After reviewing various Selma Chalk completions in the Pickens Field, it seems that the wells that cut a fault in the top 100 feet of the Chalk section performed better than the ones that did not. Acidizing (HCL) after perforating is also important for a successful completion.
 
We believe that there is potential remaining in the Selma Chalk at the Pickens Field. New locations should be drilled directly on the down-thrown side of the main faults allowing a fault cut in the top 100 feet of the Chalk section. In the Northwest portion of the Pickens Field, the chalk is more permeable and should have a higher than average recovery of oil.
 
These fields are not yet considered proven reserves because we do not have a current Reserve Report.
 
Market
 
Generally. The oil and gas industry is highly susceptible to extreme fluctuations in energy-related commodity prices, which in turn has a corresponding effect on the level of drilling and exploration activity and the costs associated therewith. Such volatility is also represented in the trends, however disparate, of supplies, demand, and price movements of crude oil and natural gas.
Regulation
 
Federal and state regulations control various aspects of drilling and operating oil and gas wells, including care of the environment, the safety of workers and the public, and the relations with the owners and occupiers of surface lands within or near the leasehold acreage. The effect of these regulations is, invariably, to increase the cost of operations. The costs of compliance with state regulations include a permit for drilling a well before beginning a project. Other compliance matters have to do with keeping the property free of oil spills and the plugging of non-productive wells.

Oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production activities are also subject to private property rights. Owners of real property also own the rights to the minerals underneath the surface, unless such mineral rights have been retained, sold or transferred by a previous landowner. Oil and gas rights held by the United States government are managed by the Bureau of Land Management in conjunction with the U.S. Forest Service pursuant to a variety of federal statutes.
 
Environmental impacts of oil and gas production include produced water and drilling waste. Wastes that cannot be reused or recycled must be stored or disposed of in some manner, increasing the land area affected by oil and gas extraction and raising concerns over potential leaking of drilling fluids and other wastes from storage sites. Some petroleum industry operations have been responsible for water pollution through by-products of refining and oil spills. The combustion of fossil fuels produces greenhouse gases and other air pollutants as byproducts. Pollutants include nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and heavy metals.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 4 part-time contractors, to pursue our business as an oil and gas exploration and development company. There exists a significant amount of competition for skilled personnel in the oil and gas services industry. Nevertheless, we expect to continue to use consultants, contract labor, attorneys and accountants as necessary.
