ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Global Eagle is a leading provider of satellite-based connectivity and media to fast-growing, global enterprise, consumer and government markets across aviation, maritime and land. Supported by proprietary and best-in-class technologies, Global Eagle entertains, informs and connects travelers and crew with our integrated suite of rich media content and seamless connectivity solutions that cover the globe. Global Eagle delivers exceptional service and rapid support to a diverse base of customers around the world. Our business currently consists of two operating segments: Connectivity and Media & Content. The discussion in this Part I, as well as under the heading “Risk Factors,” reflects these two operating segments. However, our financial results reported for fiscal years 2014, 2015 and 2016, and the discussion elsewhere in this Form 10-K, reflects our three operating segments that were in effect as of December 31, 2016. See “Introductory Note—Our Operating Segments.”
Connectivity. Our Connectivity segment provides satellite-based connectivity services to enterprise and government customers in the aviation, maritime and land vertical markets. We provide:

• | Wi-Fi connectivity (utilizing specialized network equipment and technology) that enables access to the Internet, live television, texting services, e-commerce, on-demand content and travel-related information; and


• | Connectivity-enabled solutions for advertising, operational performance management and analytics that enable our customers to increase profitability through generation of new revenue streams and more efficient operations.

Our Connectivity segment generates revenue primarily through the sale of Internet access, data, video, client-server applications, live television, advertising, operations solutions, sponsorships and other related services and network backhaul services, as well as equipment to support these services.
Media & Content. Our Media & Content segment buys, produces, manages, distributes and provides post-production services and wholly-owned and licensed media content, video and music programming, advertising, applications and video games for and to the airline, maritime and other “away from home” non-theatrical markets (also known as “mobility markets”). Our Media & Content segment generates revenue primarily through the licensing and management of owned and licensed media content, video and music programming, applications and video games to the mobility markets. Secondarily, our Media & Content segment generates revenue from providing value-added services such as selection, purchase, production, customer support, software development, creative services and technical editing and curating of media content in connection with the integration and servicing of entertainment programs as well as the sourcing of advertising from agencies and directly from brands for use in those markets.
Operating Segments
Connectivity
Our Connectivity segment provides our customers with satellite-based Internet access and Internet-enabled live television, on-demand content, texting services, e-commerce, travel-related information and backhaul solutions. We provide our customers and their passengers, crew and personnel with operational solutions and Wi-Fi connectivity primarily via C-band, Ka-band, Ku-band and Ku-band High Throughput Satellites (“Ku-HTS”) satellite transmissions. We obtain satellite coverage through various global satellite services providers, including Hughes Network Systems, LLC (“Hughes”), New Skies Satellites B.V. (“SES”), an affiliate of SES S.A., and Intelsat Corporation (“Intelsat”). Global Eagle operates a vertically integrated teleport and ground network 
4

infrastructure that integrates leased satellite capacity from multiple satellite operators. We utilize proprietary performance-enhancing technologies to increase the efficiency of our network with patented software that increases end-user quality of experience. 
Our Connectivity segment connects aircraft, vessels and fixed ground stations to orbiting satellites which link data to ground earth stations. Our ground earth stations are connected by a terrestrial broadband network with fully-meshed Multiprotocol Label Switching (“MPLS”). Global Eagle develops integrates and sells, leases and/or provides a right to use proprietary third-party manufactured antenna systems (including at times as part of an equipment and services bundle) for connectivity customers. 
Global Eagle pioneered the application of satellite-based connectivity in large airline fleets. Our aircraft Wi-Fi connectivity system was first deployed by a commercial airline in 2009, and our in-flight broadband services became fully operational in 2010. Following the completion of our licensed and operational in-flight broadband system in 2010, we commenced installation of our connectivity system equipment on Southwest Airlines Co. (“Southwest Airlines”) aircraft and began to generate revenue. As of September 30, 2017, Global Eagle provides live in-flight connectivity (“IFC”) services on 877 aircraft. 
To expand into the maritime and land connectivity markets, Global Eagle acquired EMC in July 2016 (the “EMC Acquisition”). EMC was a communications services provider that delivered communications, Internet, live television, on-demand video, voice, and network backhaul services to land-based sites and marine vessels globally, and whose offerings have now been integrated into Global Eagle. As noted above, following the EMC Acquisition, EMC comprised our third operating segment, called Maritime & Land Connectivity, which we combined with our former Aviation Connectivity segment in the second quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded a $64.0 million charge related to the impairment of goodwill in this Maritime & Land Connectivity segment. This was as a result of reduced financial projections for the Maritime & Land Connectivity reporting unit, due to, among other things: lower than expected actual financial results from this business due to margin compression resulting from competition in our cellular backhaul land business in Africa, resulting in diminished financial performance relative to our original expectations; delayed new deal executions and slower than anticipated installations and upgrades, also resulting in diminished financial performance relative to our original expectations; and operational challenges in integrating a legacy EMC acquiree in 2015 into this reporting unit, resulting in delayed acquisition synergies. Given the foregoing, we determined there was greater uncertainty in achieving our prior financial projections and so applied a higher discount rate for purposes of our goodwill impairment analysis. The higher discount rate affected the fair value of the Maritime & Land Connectivity reporting unit.
In addition, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, we expect to record an additional goodwill impairment charge of between $75.0 million and $80.0 million related to this reporting unit. This additional impairment is due to continuing challenges in the business operations at this segment as well as delay in realizing our expected synergies, which resulted in lower results than the projections as of December 31, 2016. We determined that there is a higher degree of uncertainty in achieving our financial projections and as such increased our discount rate, which reduced the fair value of the Maritime & Land Connectivity reporting unit. Also, the adoption of ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Others (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, changed the measurement of the goodwill impairment, which increased the impairment. We have not closed our books for any periods subsequent to December 31, 2016. As stated above, we expect to have a significant impairment during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, and we may have additional impairment charges in later periods after completing our impairment assessments for these periods.

Aviation Products and Services
Global Eagle offers satellite-based in-flight entertainment and connectivity solutions that provide cost-effective, high-performance IFC to global airlines. Our platform provides airlines with a single resource for global connectivity and the latest content and digital media solutions to entertain and engage passengers. At the same time, our platform provides airlines with the opportunity to differentiate and monetize their IFC offerings.
Airconnect
Our proprietary branded service, Airconnect, is available worldwide to meet the needs of the global airline industry. Through Airconnect, airline passengers can connect to the Internet through their personal Wi-Fi-enabled devices. Where permitted by government regulations, Airconnect can provide gate-to-gate connectivity. As a “white-label” provider of connectivity services, we provide our airline customers flexibility in how they want to brand and price the Airconnect service to their passengers. Our fee structure for satellite-based Internet service varies by airline and is customarily in the form of (i) a set fee for each enplaned 
5

passenger, (ii) a fee based on the number of passengers using our services or (iii) a flat rate per installed aircraft. In order to utilize our connectivity services, we provide our airline customers with the following:

• | Connectivity Equipment – We sell and lease equipment that enables our satellite-based services to operate on aircraft. Our equipment is generally shipped and sold as a single kit, with components of the kits separately priced for future ordering. Significant components of our equipment kits include the radome, antenna, modems, wireless access points and activation packages. Substantially all of our equipment is manufactured and warrantied by third-party manufacturers. Our antennas are proprietary to us in that we develop the specifications, and our third-party suppliers manufacture them exclusively for our use. 


• | Regulatory Support – We obtain Supplemental Type Certificates (“STCs”), which are certificates issued when an applicant has received Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), European Aviation Safety Agency (“EASA”) or similar international regulatory approval to modify an aircraft from its original type certificate approval. An STC on a particular aircraft type enables our equipment to be installed on that aircraft type. We have STCs for installation on the Boeing 737, 757, 767, 777 and Airbus A320 aircraft families. As an alternative to STC-based installation, we also offer our equipment for factory installation (Boeing Line-fit) on Boeing 737-700, 737-800, 737-900 and the Boeing 737 MAX family.


• | Post-Installation Support – Once our equipment is installed and operational, we provide technical and network support and management services, including 24/7 operational assistance and monitoring of each aircraft’s connectivity performance and bandwidth of our satellite-based services.

In addition, we intend in the future to provide our airline customers with the following additional offerings:

• | Airconnect Global® Antenna – In partnership with Quantenelektronische Systeme GmbH (“QEST”), the Company continues to develop a satellite antenna that would enable global usage of our services, including equatorial regions of the world (the “Global Antenna”). The Global Antenna’s innovative design features a first-of-its-kind three-axis precision pointing mechanism capable of delivering superior satellite connectivity and continuous coverage, including during flights near or below the equator, at high latitudes or during banking maneuvers. It is optimized to deliver airlines a breakthrough mix of reliability, high connection speeds and global coverage. The Global Antenna utilizes a revolutionary steerable pointing system to optimize coverage anywhere a commercial aircraft flies. The Global Antenna is compatible with our current installation architecture and STCs, and is also intended to meet the requirements for future line-fit installations. We expect to begin our first installations of this equipment in early 2018.


• | In late 2015, Global Eagle entered into an agreement with Hughes, the world's leading provider of broadband satellite solutions and services, to utilize Hughes's JUPITER™ System HT Aero Modem to power Global Eagle’s next-generation, high-performance broadband aviation service. Hughes's HT Aero Modem, including the core router module and JUPITER mobility technology, features the JUPITER System second-generation SoC (System on a Chip) that supports over 200 Mbps of throughput, readily accommodating the highest demands for aviation broadband. Compared to Hughes's prior-generation mobility terminal, the new HT modem delivers more than 10 times the throughput performance to an individual aircraft. Designed for the aviation broadband industry, the HT Aero Modem technology also provides faster spot beam and satellite switchover times. The modem is compatible with our antenna system, enabling an easy and cost-effective upgrade to improve speeds for our current connected fleet. We expect to begin our first installations of this equipment in early 2018.

Airtime IFE 
Our Airtime IFE system enables airline passengers to access a custom suite of IFE and connectivity solutions on their personal devices. Through an in-cabin Wi-Fi solution, the Airtime IFE system is a cost-effective, easy-to-install system that can replicate portions of the Airconnect IFE passenger experience without Airconnect system hardware. The Airtime IFE platform delivers content directly to all personal devices, including passenger laptops, tablets and smartphones utilizing Digital Rights Management technology to offer secured viewing of the latest Hollywood and international content.
The Airtime IFE solution also enables airlines to brand their IFE services through a customizable portal (user interface) that becomes the central platform for delivering entertainment in-flight. Airtime IFE offers a comprehensive lineup of world-class content for which airlines can determine access and pricing. The hardware required to power Airtime IFE consists of a server management unit and wireless routers installed on a plane. Media & Content can be refreshed wirelessly as often as an airline requires through our satellite network. Furthermore, our combined content, distribution and technology platforms provide airlines and millions of passengers worldwide with the industry’s most complete offering of IFE content and can deliver the most popular 
6

content according to geographical and passenger demographics. News content and sports programming can be refreshed daily and delivered to a passenger via Airtime IFE’s near-live content capability.

Competitive Advantages
Connectivity
Our satellite-based broadband services allow us to connect our customers to the Internet and deliver live-streaming television, on-demand content, texting services, shopping and other related services over land and sea. Unlike certain peer technologies, our satellite Wi-Fi platform is capable of being operated gate-to-gate (where government regulations permit) and over the majority of the commonly used air and maritime routes across the globe at the data throughput levels required to deliver a feature-rich IFE experience. We also have relationships with Hughes, SES and Intelsat, among others, and have network operational footprints worldwide. These competitive advantages provide us the ability to more rapidly on-board and service new and existing airline, maritime and land-based customers regardless of where they operate.
In addition to regional expansion, we have the ability to rapidly expand our product offerings worldwide. We launched our live television and texting services to customers in the United States and now offer similar and other related services in additional markets around the world. We target heavily air-trafficked regions, which allows us to leverage existing and add additional customers with little interruption to our base operations. Adding customers in areas with existing satellite coverage (utilized for launch customers) enables us to spread fixed costs associated with transponders over a larger network base.
9

We have dedicated engineering resources to our connectivity services, enabling us to deploy end-to-end solutions for our customers. For example, our engineering resources assist our airline customers with obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, such as STCs, which permit our equipment to be installed and operated on the applicable aircraft type covered by the STC (regardless of airline operator). As we continue to obtain STCs on a wider variety of plane types, we will be able to leverage these STCs for more rapid deployment on new airline customers in the future on a more cost-effective and efficient basis.
Our Network Operations Centers (NOCs) are based in the United States (Illinois and Florida), South America (Sao Paolo, Brazil and Paraná, Argentina), Europe (Madrid and Santander, both in Spain) and the Middle East (Sharjah, UAE). The NOCs manage our 24/7 satellite and network operations and monitor each plane and vessel whether in operation on the ground or docked. We recently expanded our NOCs facilities to manage our growing fleet of connected aircraft and vessels and to continue driving new innovations for our IFC system and offerings.
Media & Content
We develop, acquire and distribute video content, games and other media content and work closely with major and independent studios and other content producers. Accordingly, our significant operating and deal-making experience and relationships with companies in these industries gives us a number of competitive advantages and may present us with additional business targets and relationships to facilitate growth going forward. We believe that we have sustainable competitive advantages due to our market positions, technology and relationships with important content suppliers and airlines.
We are a market leader in providing content and services to the airline, maritime and other “away from home” non-theatrical markets around the world. Our cultural expertise allows us to provide customized solutions to accommodate cultural and linguistic requirements in all key markets, across industries. We provide our content services to many airlines in markets such as the Middle East, Asia and Europe, where demand for content tends to be stronger and airlines are more widely equipped with on-board IFE solutions than in the United States. We also provide solutions for advanced, interactive IFE hardware systems. The new IFE hardware systems provide the technological basis for turning the systems previously used only for the purpose of entertaining passengers into interactive passenger platforms that offer a variety of possibilities. In the IFE industry, this strategic development entails changing IFE into a complete “passenger experience.” We intend to leverage our market position and technological know-how to participate in and take advantage of this cutting-edge development in IFE for the benefit of our customers and their passengers.
With the ability to offer a wide variety of content, games and related services, we believe that we provide our customers with more content options and more cost-effective content solutions than our competitors. 
Our Growth Strategy
We believe that our combined connectivity and content services enhance and personalize the experience our customers deliver to their travelers. Using portals created specifically for the mobility audience, we provide Internet access, content-on-demand, and live television programming. Connectivity enhances our content capabilities by expanding our vertical markets across the mobility markets and introducing new capacity for personalized end-user advertising. Providing rich content directly to passengers’ own devices creates new opportunities for revenue from passengers and brand sponsorship. Content enhances our connectivity capabilities by differentiating our products, increasing traffic on our connectivity system, and providing licensing for television and live events. Our services are uniquely positioned to change the existing mobility model and drive towards a satellite-connected entertainment and commerce platform. 
Connectivity
We are seeking to aggressively expand our Connectivity solutions to customers worldwide. In aviation markets, we already have significant operations in North America, Europe and the Middle East. We have initiated operations in South America and Asia, and we strategically target new opportunities in markets with high populations and traffic density, such as Asia Pacific, China, India and Brazil, as well as major airlines in North America and Western Europe. In maritime and land markets, we are focused on winning large fleets and fixed terrestrial installations with a combination of efficient broadband capacity and integrated content that improves traveler experience, crew welfare and revenue generation for our customers.
Leverage Technology
We believe we have the most technologically advanced ground network and performance-enhancing technologies in the market today, and we plan to leverage our network strength as we incorporate the newest technology from our satellite partners. 
10

In aviation markets, our technology has proven reliability, global certifications and market-leading capabilities for performance on geostationary satellite networks at mid- and high-latitudes. In maritime and land markets, we have unique multi-band capabilities, patented technologies that improve the quality of experience for end-users and a global network backbone that we believe differentiates us from our competitors. We plan to leverage these advantages as we target expansion in new and emerging markets. 
Continue Technological Evolution

We work continuously to improve existing systems and user interfaces, while also developing plans to remain at the forefront of the technological curve. We intend to introduce to market our next-generation Ku- and Ka-band antenna systems for aviation in the near future. We also expect to continue to develop better-performing components of our system, including new aviation components to better service long-haul carriers and new maritime components for television and premium media distribution. Our strategic decision to develop key components and systems that interface with handheld devices should enable our aviation, maritime and land customers to stay on the cutting edge of technological advancements.
Media & Content
Supply-Chain Efficiency
Given our strong position in the IFE content market, we are able to manage larger customer budgets, as well as provide a fully outsourced IFE solution to our customers. We believe that this quality and scale will lead to longer-term contracts and a wider variety of services as evidenced by winning multiple new contracts with terms longer than five years and covering creative user interfaces and innovation as well as traditional content. The scale we have in our post-production facilities and range in content rights management allows for a more efficient cost structure and enables us to serve newer, smaller and more remote customers.
Increasing the Value of Traditional Content
One of our strengths is our ability to efficiently scale our post-production facilities and provide a range of content rights management to our customers. We believe that this will lead to expanded services with existing customers, and allow us to more rapidly expand our services to newer, smaller and more remote customers. 
Competition
Our Connectivity segment operates in a highly competitive environment, but only Global Eagle combines network scale across aviation, maritime and land with a global satellite and ground network system, performance-enhancing technologies, end-to-end service management including installation and repair, and fully integrated content and media services. 
In aviation, our primary in-flight connectivity competitors are Gogo, Inc., ViaSat, Inc., Thales Avionics Inc., Inmarsat plc and Panasonic Avionics Corporation. In maritime and land, our primary competitors are Speedcast, Inmarsat plc and O3b Networks Ltd. Our competitors use different technologies, including air-to-ground mobile services and satellite connectivity on C-band, Ku-band, Ka-band and L-band networks to provide connectivity to customers. We believe our satellite services offer a competitive combination of worldwide availability, quality of experience, available high-speed bandwidth and cost compared to our competitors.
Our Media & Content segment services the majority of the content market for the worldwide airline industry. We have different competitors for our various activities in the content market. For airline content curation and post-production and advertising, we primarily compete with Spafax, which is affiliated with the advertising and public-relations company WPP PLC. In the maritime market, our primary competitor is Swank Motion Picture Inc. For applications and games, we compete against two small companies on the seat-back systems whereas on open platforms there are numerous companies that provide applications for consumer mobile devices. 
We believe our state-of-the-art studio services offer unparalleled solutions to our mobility and studio partners compared to our Media & Content competitors. In addition, we believe that our worldwide relationships with major airline carriers and Hollywood studios provide us with a significant competitive advantage over our competition. For software and applications, we have built up processes for certification on all the major proprietary entertainment systems that make up the bulk of airline entertainment systems. 
Government Regulation
As a participant in the global airline and global telecommunication industries we are subject to a variety of government regulatory obligations. 
11

Federal Aviation Administration/European Aviation Safety Agency
Our aviation and maritime and land connectivity services require the installation of network hardware on aircraft and maritime vessels and in remote land locations. The installation of equipment on aircraft is subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by the FAA and its global counterparts, including the EASA. Prior to installing our equipment on an aircraft type, we are required to obtain an STC, which supplements the original Type Certificate obtained by the original aircraft manufacturer from the FAA/EASA and identifies the parts to be installed and the location of the installation and will only be issued by the FAA/EASA after we comply with any additional regulations for the installation of hardware such as ours (for example, bird strike regulation compliance). To date, we have obtained STCs for installing our connectivity solution hardware on the Boeing 737 Next Generation series of aircraft, the Boeing 757, 767 and 777 aircraft families, and the Airbus A320 family. We are also a Boeing linefit supplier for the Boeing 737 Next Generation and 737 MAX aircraft families. We currently have additional STC and linefit certification projects underway. 
Global Aero Mobile Satellite Services Regulation
In order to operate our connectivity services, we are required to obtain authorization in each jurisdiction over which we intend to provide our aero mobile satellite services (“AMSS”). In the United States, we have a license from the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) allowing us to provide AMSS services subject to compliance with various requirements imposed by the FCC. Certain other countries require affirmative licenses; however many countries only require a notification of intent to provide services and certain technical details without requiring affirmative approval. To date, we are authorized to provide our AMSS connectivity services in over 150 countries. 
Employees
As of October 31, 2017, we had approximately 1,500 employees, with approximately 40% employed in the United States. Approximately 2% of our overall workforce is employed in Brazil. Our Brazilian employees are unionized and are employed pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. Such collective bargaining agreements are renegotiated annually on May 1, generally to account for inflation. Other than the foregoing, none of our employees are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that relations with our employees are good.
Corporate History
Prior to January 2013, we were known as Global Eagle Acquisition Corp. Global Eagle Acquisition Corp. was formed in February 2011 as a “special purpose acquisition company” whose purpose was to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition or similar business combination with one or more businesses. In May 2011, we consummated an initial public offering, and from then until January 2013 did not engage in any other business operating activities. In January 2013, we completed a business combination transaction in which we acquired Row 44, Inc. and an 86% equity interest in Advanced Inflight Alliance AG (“AIA”). Following this transaction, we changed our name to Global Eagle Entertainment Inc. We later acquired the remaining 14% equity interest in AIA.
Our principal executive offices are located at 6100 Center Drive Suite 1020, Los Angeles, California, 90045.
