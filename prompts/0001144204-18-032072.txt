Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Our Company
 
During the past year, our management, at the direction of the Board of Directors, has evaluated, considered, and brought forward various opportunities to acquire producing oil fields; however, to date, an oil field meeting the criteria acceptable to the Board of Directors (which criteria include among other things, low general and administrative costs, ability to generate cash flow and ability to fully utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology (“PPT”)) had not been found. As a result, and in lieu of a potential dissolution, on March 23, 2018, we sold substantially all of our assets, including all pertinent intellectual property rights comprising our business of implementing plasma pulse technology (the “Asset Sale”), to Norma Investments Limited (“Norma”), the parent company of Ervington Investments Limited (“Ervington”), the current holder of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, for $650,000 pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Norma, dated February 12, 2018 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”). In connection with the Asset Sale, we also repurchased all of our outstanding securities held by Ervington for $8,500,000 (the “Share Repurchase”) pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement with Ervington, dated February 12, 2018 (the “Share Purchase Agreement”).
 
At this point, the Board is reevaluating its business plan and strategy and has reduced operating expenses, including staffing, in order to preserve capital, while the Board evaluates its options including the possible acquisition of a technology and oilfield services business, of which two of our current directors own a minority equity interest .
 
In July 2015, when we closed the final tranche of our private placement of the sale of our Series C Preferred Stock and raised an additional $9,750,000, we shifted our operational focus from being a direct provider of well services based upon PPT to actively seeking to acquire producing oil fields to generate revenues and the development of untapped hydrocarbon reserves. As a result, in August 2015, our board of directors and shareholders approved through the formation of a joint venture, the exclusive sublicense to our majority owned subsidiary Novas Energy North America, LLC (“NENA”) of our rights to use certain plasma pulse technology that we had licensed from Novas Energy Group Limited (the “Licensor”) pursuant to the terms of an exclusive license agreement (the “License Agreement”), for treatment of vertical wells in the United States (hereafter, the “Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology”). We retained the right to use the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment of our own assets located in the United States as well as treatment of assets outside of the United States. The Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology refers to the process and apparatus of Licensor for its plasma pulse technology as covered by Licensor’s patent rights. Although we were indirectly engaged in the oil recovery business through NENA and directly through our treatment of oil wells in Mexico, it was not our foundational business strategy. In October 2016, we terminated the joint venture due to its failure to meet certain milestones, including its generation of minimal revenue. On March —, 2018, we terminated our agreement with our Mexican partner.
 
We have financed our operations primarily from sales of our securities, both debt and equity, and to a lesser extent revenue from operations and we expect to continue to obtain required capital in a similar manner. We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $18,088,617 through December 31, 2017 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability.

On April 10, 2008 Crystal Magic, Inc. (“CMI”), a Florida Corporation, merged with an acquisition subsidiary of Pledge, and we issued an aggregate of 108,000 shares to the former shareholders of CMI. On May 6, 2008, we acquired both Mountain Capital, LLC (d/b/a Arrow Media Solutions) (“AMS”) and Auleron 2005, LLC (d/b/a Auleron Technologies) (“AUL”) and made each a wholly owned subsidiary and issued a total of 41,987 shares of our Common Stock to the members of Mountain Capital, LLC and a total of 2,721 shares of our Common Stock to the members of AUL (the shares referenced above are in pre-split amounts, that is prior to our 50-to-1 reverse split in August 2012). In 2010 AUL and AMS were dissolved. In September 2010, CMI’s assets were foreclosed upon by its largest creditor and these assets were liquidated and effective December 31, 2013, we disposed of our interest in CMI for nominal consideration.
 
In 2013, we closed a Share Exchange Agreement with the shareholders of Novas, under which we acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Novas in exchange for 100,000,000 shares of our common stock. Novas had entered into a license for use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology licensed from Licensor for use in the United States and Mexico. Prior to the closing of the second tranche of the Series C Preferred Stock private placement and the sublicense with NENA, our focus had been on the provision of production enhancement services.

(“Technovita”) (the “Joint Venture Agreement”) through a newly formed Delaware limited liability company, NENA, whereby Novas agreed to contribute $1,200,000 ($600,000 to be delivered on the effective date (October 22, 2015) of the Joint Venture Agreement, $300,000 on November 1, 2015 and $300,000 on the two month anniversary of the Effective Date) to the capital of NENA for 60% of the membership interests of NENA and Technovita agreed to contribute an aggregate of $800,000 to the capital of NENA for 40% of the membership interests of NENA. In October 2015, Novas entered into a sublicense agreement (the “Novas Sublicense Agreement”) with NENA and the Licensor pursuant to which NENA was granted the right, subject to certain exceptions to be the exclusive provider of the Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment of vertical wells to third parties in the United States. Subject to certain exceptions and pursuant to the terms of Sublicense Agreements (the “Technovita Sublicense Agreement”) that was entered into between Technovita, NENA and Licensor, NENA is the exclusive provider of the Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment of vertical wells to third parties in Canada. Both Novas and Technovita will retain the right to deploy the Plasma Pulse Technology on vertical wells owned by Novas or Technovita in the United States or Canada, respectively. On October 4, 2016, Novas Energy USA, Inc. (“Novas USA”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, delivered a notice to Technovita Technologies USA, Inc.
