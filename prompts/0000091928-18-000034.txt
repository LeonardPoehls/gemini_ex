Item 1. Business
Description of Business
South Jersey Industries, Inc. (SJI or the Company), a New Jersey corporation, was formed in 1969 for the purpose of owning and holding all of the outstanding common stock of South Jersey Gas Company, a public utility, and acquiring and developing non-utility lines of business.

SJI currently provides a variety of energy-related products and services, primarily through the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:


• | South Jersey Gas Company (SJG) is a regulated natural gas utility. SJG distributes natural gas in the seven southernmost counties of New Jersey.


• | South Jersey Energy Company (SJE) acquires and markets natural gas and electricity to retail end users and provides total energy management services to commercial, industrial and residential customers.


• | South Jersey Resources Group, LLC (SJRG) markets natural gas storage, commodity and transportation assets along with fuel management services on a wholesale basis in the mid-Atlantic, Appalachian and southern states.


• | South Jersey Exploration, LLC (SJEX) owns oil, gas and mineral rights in the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania.


• | Marina Energy, LLC (Marina) develops and operates on-site energy-related projects. It currently operates projects in New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts and Vermont. The significant wholly-owned subsidiaries of Marina include: 


• | ACB Energy Partners, LLC (ACB) owns and operates a natural gas fueled combined heating, cooling and power facility located in Atlantic City, New Jersey.


• | AC Landfill Energy, LLC (ACLE), BC Landfill Energy, LLC (BCLE), SC Landfill Energy, LLC (SCLE) and SX Landfill Energy, LLC (SXLE) own and operate landfill gas-to-energy production facilities in Atlantic, Burlington, Salem and Sussex Counties in New Jersey.


• | MCS Energy Partners, LLC (MCS), NBS Energy Partners, LLC (NBS) and SBS Energy Partners, LLC (SBS) own and operate solar-generation sites located in New Jersey.


• | South Jersey Energy Service Plus, LLC (SJESP) serviced residential and small commercial HVAC systems, installed small commercial HVAC systems, provided plumbing services and serviced appliances under warranty via a subcontractor arrangement as well as on a time and materials basis. On September 1, 2017, SJESP sold certain assets of its residential and small commercial HVAC and plumbing business to a third party. SJESP will receive commissions paid on service contracts from the third party on a go forward basis. This transaction did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.


• | SJI Midstream, LLC (Midstream) invests in infrastructure and other midstream projects, including a current project to build an approximately 118-mile natural gas pipeline in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.


In October 2017, SJI announced that it had entered into agreements to acquire the assets of Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas from Pivotal Utility Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Southern Company Gas. SJI is acquiring the assets of both companies for total consideration of $1.7 billion. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2018, and is subject to approvals by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) and the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC), with limited approvals also required from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), as well as certain anti-trust filings and approvals.
Additional Information on the nature of SJI's and SJG's businesses can be found in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” under Item 7 of this Report.

Transportation and Storage Agreements

SJG has direct connections to the interstate pipeline systems of both Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco) and Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC (Columbia). During 2017, SJG purchased and had delivered approximately 55.4 MMdts of natural gas for distribution to both on-system and off-system customers and for injections into storage. Of this total, 31.9 MMdts were transported on the Transco pipeline system while 23.5 MMdts were transported on the Columbia pipeline system. Also during 2017, third-party suppliers delivered 27.4 MMdts to SJG's system on behalf of end use customers behind SJG's city gate stations. SJG secures other long-term services from Dominion Transmission, Inc. (Dominion), a pipeline upstream of the Transco and Columbia systems. Services provided by Dominion are utilized to deliver gas into either the Transco or Columbia systems for ultimate delivery to SJG. In addition, effective December 1, 2017, SJG initiated a new firm transportation service with Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, L.L.C. (Tennessee). Gas transported by Tennessee will be delivered to the Columbia system for subsequent delivery to SJG. Services provided by all of the above-mentioned pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).  Unless otherwise indicated, our intentions are to renew or extend these service agreements before they expire.
Transco:

Transco is SJG's largest supplier of long-term gas transmission services which includes both year-round and seasonal firm transportation (FT) service arrangements. When combined, these FT services enable SJG to purchase gas from third parties and have delivered to its city gate stations by Transco a total of 297,958 dts per day (dts/d). Of this total, 133,917 dts/d is long-haul FT (where gas can be transported from the production areas of the Southwest to the market areas of the Northeast) while 164,041 dts/d is market area FT. The terms of SJG's year-round agreements with Transco extend for various periods through 2025. Certain of these agreements are currently operating under their respective evergreen provisions.

Of the 297,958 dts/d of Transco services mentioned above, SJG has released a total of 10,000 dts/d of its long-haul and 20,000 dts/d of its market area FT service. These releases were made in association with SJG's Conservation Incentive Program (CIP) discussed further under Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."  In addition, SJG released a total of 35,000 dts/d of its long-haul FT and 5,000 dts/d of its market area FT as part of Asset Management Agreements (AMA). The AMA-related releases are discussed below under “Gas Supplies.” 
SJG currently has six long-term gas storage service agreements with Transco that, when combined, are capable of storing approximately 5.0 MMdts. Through these agreements, SJG can inject gas into market and production area storages during periods of low demand and extract gas at a Maximum Daily Withdrawal Quantity (MDWQ) of up to 107,407 dts during periods of high demand. The longest term of these storage service agreements extends through March 31, 2023. 

Dominion:
SJG subscribes to a firm storage service from Dominion, under its Rate Schedule GSS.  This storage has an MDWQ of 10,000 dts during the period between November 16 and March 31 of each winter season, with an associated total storage capacity of 423,000 dts.  Gas withdrawn from Dominion GSS storage is delivered through both the Dominion and Transco (Leidy Line) pipeline systems for delivery to SJG service territory.  The primary term of this agreement extends through March 31, 2019.
Columbia:

SJG subscribes to four firm transportation agreements with Columbia which currently provide for an aggregate of 124,022 dts/d. The term of 9,000 dts/d of this capacity extends through October 31, 2022; the term of 45,022 dts/d extends through October 31, 2019; and the remaining 70,000 dts/d extends through October 31, 2030.

South Jersey Industries, Inc.
Part I

SJG also subscribes to a firm storage service with Columbia under its Rate Schedule Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) along with an associated firm transportation service under Rate Schedule SST, each of which extends through October 31, 2019. SJG has a total FSS MDWQ of 52,891 dts and a related 3,473,022 dts of storage capacity. SJG released to SJRG 19,029 dts/d of its FSS MDWQ along with 1,249,485 dts of its FSS storage capacity. Additionally, SJG released to SJRG 19,029 dts/d of its associated Columbia SST transportation service. Both releases made by SJG were in connection with its CIP and extend through September 30, 2018.
Gas Supplies
During 2017, SJG entered into an AMA with a gas marketer which extends through March 31, 2018. Under this agreement, SJG released to the marketer its firm transportation rights equal to 30,000 dts/d of transportation capacity on Transco. The marketer manages this capacity and provides SJG with up to 30,000 dts/d of firm deliverability each day through March 31, 2018. The marketer's intent was to optimize the capacity released to SJG under this AMA and pay SJG an asset management fee.
Also during 2017, SJG entered into an additional AMA with a separate gas marketer which extends through October 31, 2018. Under this agreement, SJG has released to the marketer 10,000 dts/d of its firm transportation capacity rights. As part of this transition the total quantity is split into two arrangements of 5,000 dts/d each under a separate Transco contract. The marketer manages its capacity and provides SJG with up to 10,000 dts/d of firm deliverability everyday through March 31, 2018 in one case and through October 31, 2018 as to the other. The marketers will seek to optimize the capacity released to it under this AMA and pay SJG an asset management fee.
SJG has a long-term gas purchase agreement with a gas producer, the primary term of which extends through October 31, 2019. The maximum daily quantities (MDQ) available for purchase under this agreement initially start at 6,250 dts/d and will increase to an MDQ of 25,000 dts/d. Gas purchased from this producer will be sourced in the Appalachian supply areas and delivered into the Columbia pipeline system for delivery to SJG. 
SJG also has a long-term gas purchase agreement with an additional gas producer, with a primary term which extends ten years. The MDQ available for purchase under this agreement has started, effective December 1, 2017, at 55,000 dts/d and will increase to an MDQ of 70,000 dts/d. Gas purchased from this producer will be sourced in Northeast Pennsylvania and delivered into the Columbia pipeline system for delivery to SJG.
As part of its gas purchasing strategy, SJG uses financial contracts to hedge against forward price risk. These contracts are recoverable through SJG’s Basic Gas Supply Service Clause (BGSS), subject to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) approval. 
Supplemental Gas Supplies
SJG operates peaking facilities, located in McKee City, NJ, where it liquefies, stores and vaporizes liquefied natural gas (LNG) for injection into its distribution system. SJG's LNG facility has a storage capacity equivalent to 434,300 dts of natural gas and has an installed capacity to vaporize up to 118,250 dts of LNG per day for injection into its distribution system.

Peak-Day Supply

SJG plans for a winter season peak-day demand on the basis of an average daily temperature of 2 degrees Fahrenheit (F) or 63 Heating Degree Days. Gas demand on such a design day for the 2017-2018 winter season is estimated to be 527,490 dts (excluding industrial customers). SJG projects that it has adequate supplies and interstate pipeline entitlements to meet its design day requirements. SJG experienced its highest peak-day demand for calendar year 2017 of 480,820 dts (including industrial customers) on December 31, while experiencing an average temperature of 12.9 degrees F that day.

Natural Gas Prices

SJG's average cost of natural gas purchased and delivered in 2017, 2016 and 2015, including demand charges, was $3.75 per dt, $3.40 per dt and $4.71 per dt, respectively.

Transportation and Storage Agreements - Natural Gas

Access to gas suppliers and cost of gas are significant to the operations of SJE. No material part of the business of SJE is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers. SJE purchases delivered gas only, primarily from SJRG. Consequently, SJE maintains no transportation or storage agreements.
Electric Supply

Due to the liquidity in the market, SJE primarily purchases delivered electric in the day-ahead and real-time markets through regional transmission organizations.

Patents and Franchises

South Jersey Gas Company

SJG holds nonexclusive franchises granted by municipalities in the seven-county area of southern New Jersey that it serves. No other natural gas public utility presently serves the territory covered by SJG's franchises. Otherwise, patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and concessions are not material to the business of SJG.
Seasonal Aspects

South Jersey Gas Company

SJG experiences seasonal fluctuations in sales when selling natural gas for heating purposes. SJG meets this seasonal fluctuation in demand from its firm customers by buying and storing gas during the summer months, and by drawing from storage and purchasing supplemental supplies during the heating season. As a result of this seasonality, SJG's revenues and net income are significantly higher during the first and fourth quarters than during the second and third quarters of the year.

Non-Utility Companies

Among SJI's non-utility activities, wholesale (including fuel supply management) and retail gas marketing have seasonal patterns similar to SJG's. Activities such as energy services and energy project development do not follow seasonal patterns. Other activities, such as retail electric marketing, can have seasonal earnings patterns that are different from the utility. The first and fourth quarters remain the periods where most of SJI's revenue and net income is produced.
