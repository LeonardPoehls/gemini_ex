Our Company
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company driven by an overriding purpose - to save lives, alleviate suffering and contribute to the economics of healthcare. Our goal is to create transformational solutions to address the most pressing healthcare needs facing patients, physicians and providers in cardiovascular care. We are focused on inclisiran, an investigational agent which is potentially a first-in-class lipid-lowering drug, to reduce LDL-cholesterol, or LDL-C, which is commonly referred to as “bad” cholesterol, in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or ASCVD, or cardiovascular risk-equivalents. We believe that inclisiran possesses favorable attributes that competitive products do not possess, would satisfy unmet medical needs and has the potential to improve the economics of healthcare. We have the right to develop, manufacture and commercialize inclisiran under our collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Alnylam. In addition, we market Angiomax® (bivalirudin) in the United States primarily through a supply and distribution agreement with Sandoz Inc., or Sandoz, under which we granted Sandoz the exclusive right to sell in the United States an authorized generic of Angiomax. 
Business Strategy 
On November 3, 2015, we announced that we were in the process of evaluating our operations with a goal of unlocking and maximizing stockholder value. In particular, we stated our intention was to explore strategies for optimizing our capital structure and liquidity position and to narrow our operational focus by strategically separating non-core businesses and products in order to generate non-dilutive cash and reduce associated cash burn and capital requirements. 
As a result of our decision to narrow our operational focus, we have completed the following transactions:

• | On February 1, 2016, we completed the sale of our hemostasis portfolio, consisting of PreveLeak, Raplixa and Recothrom, to wholly owned subsidiaries of Mallinckrodt plc, or Mallinckrodt. At the completion of the sale, we received approximately $174.1 million in cash and may receive up to an additional $235.0 million in the aggregate following the achievement of certain specified calendar year net sales milestones with respect to net sales of PreveLeak and Raplixa. 


• | On June 21, 2016, we completed the sale of Cleviprex, Kengreal and rights to Argatroban for Injection, which we refer to collectively as Non-Core ACC Assets, to Chiesi USA, Inc., or Chiesi USA, and its parent company Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A., or Chiesi. At the completion of the sale, we received approximately $263.8 million in cash, which included the value of product inventory, and may receive up to an additional $480.0 million in the aggregate following the achievement of certain specified calendar year net sales milestones with respect to net sales of each of Cleviprex and Kengreal. 


• | On January 5, 2018, we completed the sale of our infectious disease portfolio, consisting of the products Vabomere, Orbactiv and Minocin IV and line extensions thereof, and substantially all of the assets related thereto, other than certain pre-clinical assets, to Melinta Therapeutics, Inc., or Melinta. At the completion of the sale, we received approximately $166.4 million and 3,313,702 shares of Melinta common stock having a market value, based on Melinta's closing share price on January 5, 2018, of approximately $54.5 million. In addition, we are entitled to receive (i) a cash payment payable 12 months following the closing of the transaction equal to $25 million; (ii) a cash payment payable 18 months following the closing of the transaction equal to $25 million; and (iii) tiered royalty payments of 5% to 25% on worldwide net sales of (a) Vabomere and (b) Orbactiv and Minocin IV, collectively. 

The transactions above are described in more detail in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Development Activity of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Consistent with our intentions announced in November 2015, in January 2017 we announced that we were seeking opportunities to partner or divest Ionsys (fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system). Although we continue to seek a partnership or divestiture transaction for Ionsys, in June 2017 we commenced a voluntary discontinuation and withdrawal of Ionsys from the market and ceased related commercialization activities, with the regulatory authorizations for Ionsys remaining open. In addition, in August 2017, we announced that we are discontinuing the clinical development program for MDCO-700, an investigational anesthetic agent.
As a result of these transactions, we are now focused on the development of inclisiran as a transformative treatment for ASCVD. 
 2

Further, as a result of the rapid and significant evolution our business and the narrowing of our operational focus onto inclisiran, our board of directors determined to restructure the board, adding directors with relevant expertise and experience and reducing the board’s overall size from twelve to seven members, providing a more agile and efficient structure.  Accordingly, the board of directors has determined that the slate of directors to be nominated for election as directors at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders will consist of:  Alexander J. Denner, Fredric N. Eshelman, Geno J. Germano, John C. Kelly, Clive A. Meanwell, Paris Panayiotopoulos, and Sarah J. Schlesinger.
Inclisiran
Overview
Inclisiran is a subcutaneously administered proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, or PCSK9, synthesis inhibitor which works through RNA interference, or RNAi, and is being developed for the potential treatment of hypercholesterolemia. We obtained rights to this product candidate under a license and collaboration agreement that we entered into with Alnylam in February 2013 to develop, manufacture and commercialize RNAi therapeutics targeting the PCSK9 gene for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and other human diseases. RNAi is a naturally occurring biological pathway within cells for selectively silencing and regulating the translation of specific mRNAs. PCSK9 is a protein involved in the regulation of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, receptor levels on hepatocytes and the metabolism of LDL-C. Inclisiran is designed to inhibit the synthesis of PCSK9 and results in lower LDL-C levels.
PCSK9 and PCSK9 inhibition 
PCSK9, a member of the serine protease family, plays a key role in controlling the levels of LDL receptors on the surface of hepatocytes. PCSK9 is expressed and secreted into the bloodstream predominantly by the liver, binds LDL receptors both intracellularly and extracellularly and promotes the lysosomal degradation of these receptors in hepatocytes, thereby increasing the circulating LDL-C levels. Loss of function mutations in PCSK9 have been found to lead to increased LDL receptors expression on hepatocytes, reduced serum LDL-C levels, and a lower risk for coronary heart disease, with no apparent negative health consequences. 
Recently-developed and approved PCSK9-blocking monoclonal antibodies, Amgen’s Repatha® (evolocumab) and Sanofi’s Praluent® (alirocumab), reduce circulating PCSK9 levels and lower LDL-C levels. Preliminary reports and analyses of Amgen’s FOURIER trial with Repatha, the first large cardiovascular outcomes trial, indicated that treatment with such antibodies can lead to the reduction of cardiovascular events compared with placebo. Results from the FOURIER study were reported by Amgen in March 2017 in which Repatha significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular events. The FOURIER study, which had approximately 27,000 subjects with clinically evident ASCVD, met its primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or MI, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization) and the key secondary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI or nonfatal stroke). 
RNA interference 
RNA interference, or RNAi, is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a major new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is being developed. Small interfering RNA, or siRNA, the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam's RNAi therapeutic platform, and which yielded inclisiran, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA, or mRNA - the genetic precursors - that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.
Clinical Development
Overview 
Under our license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam, we and Alnylam initially collaborated on the development of inclisiran and ALN-PCS02, an intravenously administered earlier RNAi therapeutic. Alnylam was responsible for the development of these product candidates until Phase 1 was completed. We have assumed all other responsibility for the development and commercialization of all product candidates under our agreement with Alnylam. In October 2013, we and Alnylam selected a lead subcutaneously administered development candidate, now referred to as inclisiran, for development for the potential treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In December 2014, under the terms of our agreement with Alnylam, Alnylam initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of inclisiran in the United Kingdom. Data from the Phase 1 trial was presented at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in August 2015 and at the American Heart Association meeting in November 2015, and was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

In January 2016, we began enrolling patients in the ORION-1 Phase 2 dose finding trial. ORION-1 was conducted as a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial of single or multiple subcutaneous injections of inclisiran in a total of 501 patients with ASCVD or ASCVD-risk equivalents (e.g., diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia), and elevated LDL-C despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C lowering therapies. The study compared the effect of different doses of inclisiran and evaluated the potential for an infrequent dosing regimen. The primary endpoint of the study was the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline at Day 180.
In March 2017, we reported positive final results from the ORION-1 Phase 2 study of inclisiran. Efficacy data presented reaffirmed inclisiran’s significant LDL-C lowering effects following a starting dose of 300 mg given on Day-1 and Day-90, after which the mean LDL-C showed reduction by an average of 52.6% and up to 81% at Day-180. For the subsequent six-month period - from Day-90 to Day-270 - the time-averaged LDL-C reduction was 51%. These robust data underscore the selection of a six-monthly maintenance dose of 300 mg in the inclisiran Phase 3 clinical program. With completion of one-year follow-up, safety data for inclisiran from the Phase 2 ORION-1 study includes 370 subject-years of observation, including at least 300 subject-years of inclisiran effects. No material safety issues were observed on inclisiran in ORION-1, which demonstrated an adverse event profile similar to placebo. 
We developed a dose-pharmacodynamic, or dose-PD, model based on the ORION-1 data to perform modeling and simulation experiments to support the selection of the Phase 3 dose and dose regimen. The dose-PD modeling and simulation supported the clinical observations from ORION-1 that a 300 mg dose given subcutaneously on Day-1, Day-90 and then every six months thereafter is the optimal dose and dose regimen for further testing in Phase 3. This dose and dose regimen maintains a time-averaged LDL-C reduction of >50%. Our initial Phase 3 ORION program, described below, will test this dose and dose regimen in high risk patients with ASCVD, ASCVD risk equivalents and familial hypercholesterolemia, or FH. Further dose-PD modeling and simulation demonstrated that a 300 mg dose given once a year would result in a time-averaged LDL-C reduction of approximately 43-45%. We believe that this once a year dose regimen of 300 mg of inclisiran could be tested in patient populations at lower risk for cardiovascular events such as primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
In January 2017, we initiated the ORION-2 and ORION-3 studies. ORION-2 examines the efficacy, safety and tolerability of inclisiran in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HoFH. The ORION-3 study is an open label extension study with the objective to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of long-term dosing of inclisiran and will also measure the effects of treatment, including a comparison of the effects of inclisiran and evolocumab (trade named Repatha) on certain clinical and patient-reported endpoints, as well as the effects of switching from evolocumab to inclisiran. 
Phase 3 Clinical Program - ORION 5, 9, 10 and 11 clinical trials. 
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we initiated the Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program for inclisiran. The Phase 3 program is comprised of four pivotal clinical trials in patients with ASCVD, ASCVD risk equivalents and FH. We anticipate that data from the four trials will support the submission of an NDA in the United States and a marketing authorization application, or MAA, in the European Union at or around the end of 2019. In the ORION-9, ORION-10 and ORION-11 trials, patients will be studied for 18 months and the dose of inclisiran will be 300 mg given subcutaneously on Day-1, Day-90 and then every six months thereafter for a total of four doses of inclisiran during the 18-month study period. We expect patients in the ORION-5 trial to have a shorter comparative treatment window than the patients in the other ORION Phase 3 trials. The four Phase 3 clinical trials are further described below:

Study | Sites | Main inclusion criteria | Patients
ORION-5 | US, EU, South Africa (SA) | Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HoFH | 45 
ORION-9 | US, EU, SA | Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HeFH | 400 
ORION-10 | US | ASCVD | 1,500 
ORION-11 | EU, SA | ASCVD and risk equivalent patients | 1,500 
 | | | 3,445 

ORION-5 is planned to be a two-part (double-blind, placebo-controlled/open label) multicenter study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of inclisiran in approximately 45 subjects with HoFH. We expect to commence the ORION-5 trial in 2018 following FDA review of the protocol. On January 23, 2018, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for inclisiran for the treatment of HoFH.

ORION-9 is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study of inclisiran versus placebo (1:1) in approximately 400 patients with HeFH. The primary endpoint of ORION-9 study is LDL-C reduction from baseline at Day-510. The ORION-9 trial commenced in November 2017. In February 2018, we announced that this trial had exceeded its target enrollment of 400 patients.
ORION-10 is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study of inclisiran versus placebo (1:1) in approximately 1,500 patients with ASCVD and elevated LDL-C levels above 70 mg/dL despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C lowering therapies including statins. The primary endpoint of ORION-10 study is LDL-C reduction from baseline at Day-510. The ORION-10 trial commenced in November 2017 and we expect to complete enrollment during the first half of 2018. 
ORION-11 is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study of inclisiran versus placebo (1:1) in approximately 1,500 patients with ASCVD or ASCVD-risk equivalents and elevated LDL-C levels above 70 mg/dL or 100 mg/dL, respectively, despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C lowering therapies including statins. The primary endpoint of the study is LDL-C reduction from baseline at Day-510. The ORION-11 trial commenced in November 2017. In January 2018, we announced that this trial had exceeded its target enrollment of 1,500 patients. 
Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial - ORION-4
We also expect to perform a cardiovascular outcomes trial in approximately 15,000 patients with ASCVD on a background of standard of care lipid-lowering therapy (usually high intensity statins), to determine the effects inclisiran on cardiovascular outcomes. We expect to initiate enrollment in the trial in 2018. The overall design of the ORION-4 outcomes trial has been agreed to with the FDA and EMA. The ORION-4 study will be conducted in close collaboration with the academic groups, Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit of the University of Oxford and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Study Group of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, as well as other scientific experts. The protocol is currently under review by the FDA. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial will be a composite endpoint of coronary heart disease death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal or non-fatal ischemic stroke and urgent coronary revascularization. These endpoints have been demonstrated to be modifiable in previous, similar outcomes trials with lipid modifying therapies. The duration of the outcomes trial will be long enough, with a median of four to five years follow-up, to accumulate a sufficient number of events to provide overwhelming statistical power to ascertain treatment group differences and maximize the clinical effect size associated with LDL-C lowering. We anticipate that, if inclisiran is approved for sale and the outcomes trial is successful, we will submit the results of the outcomes trial to the FDA as a supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, and as a variation to the MAA with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA.
Medical Need
Despite advances in treatment, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, resulting in over 17 million deaths annually. Eighty percent of all cardiovascular disease deaths are due to coronary heart disease or strokes. Elevated LDL-C is a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease and has recently been described as causative. Lowering LDL-C has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or heart attack, and within the range of effects achieved so far, the clinical risk reduction is linearly-proportional to absolute LDL-C reduction. 
Approximately 100 million people worldwide are treated with lipid lowering therapies, predominantly statins, to reduce LDL-C and the associated risk of death, nonfatal MI and nonfatal stroke or associated events. There is an unmet need for additional treatment options beyond currently-available treatments for lowering of the LDL-C level to reduce cardiovascular risk, as residual risk for cardiovascular events remains and statins are associated with well-known limitations. First, not all subjects reach LDL-C levels associated with optimal protection against clinical events. This is particularly true in patients with pre-existing coronary heart disease and/or diabetes or a history of FH, who are at the highest risk and require the most intensive management Second, not all subjects tolerate statins or are able to take statins at sufficiently-intensive doses. Third, observational studies have demonstrated that >50% of patients do not adhere to statin therapy for more than six months. 
We believe that new effective treatments to significantly lower LDL-C are needed. Clinical studies performed with inclisiran, as well as clinical studies performed with monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9, with or without statins, have demonstrated that therapies that act on PCSK9 lower LDL-C by as much as 50%, and therefore have the potential to meet this unmet need for additional significant LDL-C reduction. In addition, we believe that the ease of dosing of inclisiran - small volume, subcutaneous injections twice a year, most likely given by healthcare professionals - may improve patient adherence to lipid therapy, which has been a significant problem with all other approaches.
Approved Products
Angiomax
Angiomax is an intravenous direct thrombin inhibitor that is a peptide compound. We licensed Angiomax from Biogen Idec, Inc., or Biogen Idec, in 1997 and have exclusive license rights to develop, market and sell Angiomax worldwide. Angiomax is 
 5

approved in the United States for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing PTCA and for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, with provisional use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors, or GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, including patients with or at risk of heparin-induced thromboticytopenia, or HIT, or heparain-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome, or HITTS.
We sell Angiomax in the United States under our name as a branded Angiomax product, and, on July 2, 2015, entered into a supply and distribution agreement with Sandoz under which we granted Sandoz the exclusive right to sell in the United States an authorized generic of Angiomax (bivalirudin). We entered into the supply and distribution agreement as a result of the July 2, 2015 U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or Federal Circuit Court, ruling against us in our patent infringement litigation with Hospira, Inc., or Hospira, with respect to U.S. Patent No. 7,582,727, or the ‘727 patent, and U.S. Patent No. 7,598,343, or the ‘343 patent, covering a more consistent and improved Angiomax drug product and the processes by which it is made. In addition to Hospira, other generic firms have entered the market. Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Mylan, commenced marketing its generic bivalirudin product following a decision by the Federal Circuit Court in Mylan’s appeal that reversed an earlier district court decision that found that Mylan’s abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, product infringed all of the asserted claims of the ‘727 patent. APP Pharmaceuticals LLC, or APP, through its affiliated company, Fresenius Kabi, commenced selling its generic version of Angiomax under provisions of a settlement agreement triggered by the Federal Circuit Court’s July 2, 2015 decision in the Hospira matter. Apotex Inc. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories have each also commenced commercialization of generic bivalirudin products upon receiving final approval if their respective ANDA filings by the FDA even though we remain in active litigation against Apotex and only recently settled with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories. In addition, in January 2018 Baxter International Inc., or Baxter, announced that the FDA approved Baxter’s ready-to-use formulation of bivalirudin for use as an anticoagulant in patients undergoing PCI.
A number of companies in addition to Hospira, Mylan, APP, Apotex Inc. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories have filed ANDAs for their generic versions of Angiomax. In addition to the generic versions and the ready-to-use version of bivalirudin currently being sold, Angiomax could be subject to further generic competition in the United States from Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and its affiliates, or Teva, and other generic ANDA filers that we have settled with, under the circumstances set forth in our respective settlement agreements with such parties and upon a final approval of each company's ANDA filings by the FDA. Pliva Hrvatska DOO, an affiliate of Teva, currently has tentative approval for its ANDA filing for its generic version of Angiomax. Other ANDA filers may commercialize their products ‘at risk’ if they receive final approval of their respective ANDA filings and are not subject to a Hatch-Waxman 30-month stay. Further, we remain in infringement litigation involving the ‘727 patent and ‘343 patent with the other ANDA filers. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for descriptions of our litigation with ANDA filers and related settlements. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of our infringement litigation. We may continue to incur further legal expenses related to these matters.
Angiomax is approved in the European Union for use as an anticoagulant in adult patients undergoing PCI, including patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, or STEMI, undergoing primary PCI. The approval for acute coronary syndrome in Europe also includes treatment of adult patients with unstable angina or non-STEMI planned for urgent or early intervention, when used with aspirin and clopidogrel. In Europe, the principal patent covering Angiomax expired in August 2015 and as a result, we do not have market exclusivity for Angiomax in Europe. In addition, Angiomax is also approved for use in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Russia, India and a number of countries in Central America, South America and the Middle East for PCI indications similar to those approved by the FDA or EMA. In addition, Angiomax is approved in Canada for the treatment of patients with HIT/HITTS undergoing cardiac surgery. We are in the process of voluntarily discontinuing and withdrawing Angiomax from the market outside of North America and have ceased related commercialization activities.
In 2017, our total net revenues related to branded Angiomax and authorized generic Angiomax (bivalirudin) were approximately $44.6 million. Net product revenues related to sales of Angiomax in 2017 totaled approximately $18.8 million, including approximately $11.2 million of net product sales in the United States. Royalty revenues in 2017 related to the authorized generic sale of Angiomax (bivalirudin) by Sandoz totaled approximately $25.8 million.
Ionsys
Ionsys (fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system) is a compact, needle-free patient-controlled system for the short term management of acute postoperative pain for adults requiring opioid analgesia in the hospital. In April 2015, we received FDA approval of our sNDA for Ionsys, and in November 2015, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Ionsys in the European Union. In June 2017, we commenced a voluntary discontinuation and withdrawal of Ionsys from the market and ceased related commercialization activities, with the regulatory authorizations for Ionsys remaining open as we continue to explore opportunities to partner or divest Ionsys. 
In 2017, our net product sales of Ionsys totaled approximately $0.1 million.

Research and Development Infectious Disease Portfolio
We maintain a small infectious disease research unit in San Diego focused on the discovery of novel antibiotics. Our research programs include next-generation beta-lactamase inhibitors, or BLIs, as well as other innovative classes to treat resistant gram-negative infections. Our BLI research program focuses on identifying compounds with improved attributes such as broadened coverage of resistance mechanisms and oral bioavailability. Our programs are at the pre-clinical stage of development and are supported in part through our government contracts and partnerships including the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. This agreement, which we refer to as the BARDA OTA agreement, was established under HHS’s Other Transaction Authority, known as OTA.
Sales and Distribution
On July 2, 2015, we entered into a supply and distribution agreement with Sandoz, which we amended in July 2017, under which we granted Sandoz the exclusive right to sell bivalirudin (250 mg/ml) in the United States under our approved NDA for Angiomax but labeled and sold under the Sandoz name. We refer to this product herein as authorized generic Angiomax (bivalirudin). Under the agreement, we agreed to supply Sandoz and Sandoz agreed to purchase exclusively from us authorized generic Angiomax (bivalirudin). Sandoz has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to market, distribute and sell authorized generic Angiomax (bivalirudin) in the United States during the term of the agreement. Sandoz has agreed to pay us a set price per vial and Sandoz will pay us on a quarterly basis a high double digit percentage of its net profits (net sales less our cost of goods and certain agreed expenses of Sandoz) on sales of authorized generic Angiomax (bivalirudin). The term of the agreement will continue until July 2, 2020 and will automatically renew for successive one-year periods thereafter unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least six months prior to the end of the applicable term. Either party may terminate the agreement at any time if the other party is in material breach of the agreement and does not cure such breach within 60 days, the other party undergoes bankruptcy events, the other party is unable to perform its obligations under the agreement for more than 120 consecutive days due to a force majeure event, compliance with the agreement would violate law or net profits related to sales of the authorized generic Angiomax in any month fall below a low double digit percentage of net sales of the authorized generic Angiomax in such month. We may also terminate the agreement at any time that no other pharmaceutical product containing bivalirudin in a lyophilized form as its sole active ingredient is being sold in the United States.
We distribute our branded Angiomax product through a sole source distribution model with Integrated Commercialization Solutions, or ICS. Under this model, we currently sell our branded Angiomax product to our sole source distributor, ICS. ICS then sells branded Angiomax to a limited number of national medical and pharmaceutical wholesalers with distribution centers located throughout the United States and, in certain cases, directly to hospitals. 
Our agreement with ICS, which we initially entered into in February 2007 and have subsequently amended from time to time, provides that ICS will be our exclusive distributor of our branded Angiomax product. Under the terms of this fee-for-service agreement, ICS places orders with us for sufficient quantities of branded Angiomax to maintain an appropriate level of inventory based on our wholesalers’ historical purchase volumes. ICS assumes all credit and inventory risks, is subject to our standard return policy and has sole responsibility for determining the prices at which it sells branded Angiomax, subject to specified limitations in the agreement. The agreement terminates on February 28, 2019 and will automatically renew for additional one-year periods unless either party gives notice at least 90 days prior to the automatic extension. Either party may terminate the agreement at any time and for any reason upon 180 days prior written notice to the other party. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement upon an uncured default of a material obligation by the other party and other specified conditions. ICS’s payment terms under our distribution agreement with them are 45 days, which can be further extended to 49 days if ICS pays by wire transfer. 
We also market and sell Angiomax outside the United States, principally through distributor relationships. These distributors include Sandoz Canada Inc., which distributes Angiomax in Canada, and affiliates of Grupo Ferrer Internacional who distribute Angiox in Cyprus, Greece, Portugal and Spain and in a number of countries in Central America and South America. We also have agreements with other third parties for other countries outside of the United States. We are in the process of voluntarily discontinuing and withdrawing Angiomax from the market outside of North America and ceasing related commercialization activities, including terminating our agreements with our distributors. We have also entered into a strategic collaboration with SciClone Pharmaceuticals, or SciClone, under which we granted SciClone a license and the exclusive rights to promote, market and sell Angiomax in China. 
Manufacturing
We do not have a manufacturing infrastructure and we do not intend to develop one. We are a party to agreements with contract manufacturers for the supply of bulk drug substance for our products and with other third parties for the formulation, packaging and distribution of our products. Our product manufacturing operation is comprised of professionals with expertise in pharmaceutical 
 7

manufacturing, product development, logistics and supply chain management and quality management and supply chain compliance. These professionals oversee the manufacturing and distribution of our products by third-party companies. 
Inclisiran
Under our agreement with Alnylam, Alnylam supplied the quantity of finished product required for the conduct of the first Phase 1 clinical trial and the first Phase 2 clinical trial of inclisiran. Alnylam bore the costs of these activities, subject to certain agreed-upon caps. We have the sole right and responsibility to manufacture and supply licensed product for further development and commercialization under our development plan. We and Alnylam entered into a development supply agreement under which Alnylam agreed to transfer the manufacturing technology for the product to us or our third-party manufacturers. We have entered into agreements with two contract manufacturing organizations for the manufacture of clinical supplies of drug substance, and another manufacturing organization for the supply of drug product for use in clinical and non-clinical studies. Subsequent to the completion of Phase 2 all clinical and non-clinical materials have been directly sourced from suppliers by us. 
Bulk Drug Substance. On October 27, 2016, we entered into a services and supply agreement with Agilent Technologies, or Agilent, to supply inclisiran sodium manufactured by a chemical solid phase oligonucleotide based process. Agilent has supplied a number of batches using this process that have been used in drug product manufacture for clinical studies. Further on December 9, 2015, we entered into a services and supply agreement, as amended on July 27, 2016, with Nitto Denko Avecia for the technical transfer and manufacture of inclisiran sodium. We have an agreement with Alnylam for the supply of GalNAc-resin, a key starting material through process validation. Additionally, we and Alnylam are transferring technology and relationships for the manufacturer of GalNAc-resin and associated components to third parties jointly selected by us and Alnylam for the manufacture of commercial supplies of GalNAc-succinate and GalNAc-resin.
Drug Product. On June 3, 2016, we entered into a master service agreement with Alcami Corporation to develop processes and methods for the manufacture of inclisiran drug product. Under the agreement, Alcami has manufactured all of the inclisiran sodium vials and placebo vials used to date in clinical and non-clinical studies.
Additionally, on September 25, 2017, we entered into a technology transfer and manufacturing service agreement with Corden Pharma for the development and manufacture of pre-filled syringes of inclisiran sodium and placebo for use in clinical studies. To date pre-filled syringes have not been used in clinical studies. 
Angiomax
Bulk Drug Substance. In December 1999, we entered into a commercial development and supply agreement with Lonza Braine, S.A., or Lonza Braine, which was formerly known as UCB Bioproducts S.A., for the development and supply of Angiomax bulk drug substance. Together with Lonza Braine, we developed a second generation chemical synthesis process to improve the economics of manufacturing Angiomax bulk drug substance. This process, which was approved by the FDA in May 2003 and is used in the manufacture of Angiomax bulk drug substance today, is known as the Chemilog process. We have agreed that, during the term of the agreement, we will purchase a substantial portion of our Angiomax bulk drug substance manufactured using the Chemilog process from Lonza Braine at agreed upon prices. Following the expiration of the agreement or if we terminate the agreement prior to its expiration, Lonza Braine has agreed to transfer the development technology to us. If we engage a third party to manufacture Angiomax for us using the Chemilog process prior to bivalirudin becoming a generic drug in the United States, we will be obligated to pay Lonza Braine a royalty based on the amount paid by us to the third-party manufacturer. In June 2015, we amended the agreement with Lonza providing for the transition of the manufacture of Angiomax bulk drug substance from the Chemilog process to a solid phase peptide synthesis process. The amendment extends the expiration date of the agreement to December 31, 2019, subject to automatic renewals of consecutive three-year periods unless either party provides notice of non-renewal within eighteen months prior to the expiration of the initial term or any renewal term. We may only terminate the agreement prior to its expiration in the event of a material breach by Lonza Braine, if such breach is not cured within 30 days. In December 2016, Lonza Braine agreed to sell its peptide business, including the production and supply of Angiomax bulk drug substance, to Polypeptide Laboratories Holding AB.
Drug Product. In March 2011, we entered into a master agreement with Patheon International A.G., or Patheon International, for the manufacture of Angiomax drug product. Pursuant to the agreement, as amended, Patheon International conducts the fill-finish of Angiomax drug product for our commercial sale supply in accordance with binding commitments in a forecast provided by us. Our agreement with Patheon International expires in December 2018, subject to automatic renewals for successive terms of two years each unless either party gives written notice to the other party of its intention to terminate the agreement at least 18 months prior to the end of the then current term. Either party may terminate the agreement for material breach by the other party, if the material breach is not cured within 60 days after written notice, unless the breach by its nature is not curable. In such case, the non-breaching party has the right to terminate the agreement immediately upon providing written notice as long as the written notice is provided within 30 days of the terminating party receiving notice of the breach. We have the right to terminate the agreement upon 
 8

30 days’ prior written notice in the event that any governmental agency takes any action, or raises any objection, that prevents us from importing, exporting, purchasing or selling Angiomax. 
In January 2012, we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with APP. Under the contract manufacturing agreement, as amended, we agreed to purchase from APP a specified minimum percentage of our requirements for Angiomax finished product for the sale of the Angiomax product in the United States. We agreed to pay APP a fixed price per vial supplied and to reimburse APP for specified development costs and capital expenditures made by APP. The term of the contract manufacturing agreement ends on April 30, 2021, but may be extended, at our sole option, for an additional term of two years. If a generic form of bivalirudin for injection is marketed by APP or another third party during the term of the contract manufacturing agreement, we have the right to renegotiate the price and minimum quantity terms of the contract manufacturing agreement and, if such terms cannot be agreed to by the parties, we will have the right to terminate the contract manufacturing agreement upon 90 days prior written notice. Either party may terminate the contract manufacturing agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party, effective immediately in the case of a non-curable breach and effective upon 60 days prior written notice in the case of a curable breach if such breach is not cured within such 60-day period. Either party may also terminate the contract manufacturing agreement if the other party undergoes bankruptcy events. We may terminate the contract manufacturing agreement upon at least 12 months’ prior written notice if we decide to discontinue marketing the Angiomax product in the United States or upon 30 days’ prior written notice in the event that any government or regulatory authority prevents us from purchasing or selling the Angiomax product in the United States. 
Competition
The development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive. We face competition from pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater capital resources, research and development capabilities and experience, and financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and human resources than we have. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors.
In addition, our competitors may develop, market or license products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than any that have been or are being developed by us, or may obtain marketing approval for their products from the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. We compete, in the case of our Angiomax, and expect to compete, in the cases of inclisiran, on the basis of product efficacy, safety, ease of administration, price and economic value compared to drugs used in current practice or currently being developed.
Inclisiran
The market targeting hypercholesterolemia is highly competitive. First line therapy consisting of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, which block production of cholesterol by the liver and increase clearance of LDL-C from the bloodstream, are widely prescribed and subject to generic competition. If approved, we expect inclisiran to compete with the two currently approved and marketed anti-PCSK9 antibodies, Amgen’s Repatha and Sanofi’s Praluent, which are indicated for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the United States and Europe. In addition, we believe other PCSK9-targeted approaches are in development at a number of companies. Oral products that lower LDL-C, if approved, including Bempedoic Acid (ETC-1002), which is being developed by Esperion Therapeutics Inc., and gemcabene, which is being developed by Gemphire Therapeutics Inc. and antisense oligonucleotide-based therapies in development may also be competitive with inclisiran, if approved.
Angiomax
Angiomax has been subject to generic competition since 2015. Hospira, Mylan, APP, Apotex Inc. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories are currently selling generic versions of Angiomax. In addition, a number of companies in addition to Hospira, Mylan, APP, Apotex Inc. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories have filed ANDAs for their generic versions of Angiomax. In addition to the generic versions and the ready-to-use version of bivalirudin currently being sold, Angiomax could be subject to further generic competition in the United States from Teva and other generic ANDA filers that we have settled with under the circumstances set forth in our respective settlement agreements with such parties and upon a final approval of each company's ANDA filings by the FDA. Pliva Hrvatska DOO, an affiliate of Teva, currently has tentative approval for its ANDA filing for its generic version of Angiomax. Other ANDA filers may commercialize their products ‘at risk’ if they receive final approval of their respective ANDA filings and are not subject to a Hatch-Waxman 30-month stay. Further, we remain in infringement litigation involving the ‘727 patent and ‘343 patent with the other ANDA filers. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for descriptions of our litigation with ANDA filers and related settlements. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of our infringement litigation. We may continue to incur further legal expenses related to these matters. In addition, in January 2018 Baxter announced that the FDA approved Baxter’s ready-to-use formulation of bivalirudin.
 9

In addition to generic versions and the ready-to-use version of Angiomax, Angiomax competes with heparin and treatment regimens combining heparin and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Heparin is widely used in patients with ischemic heart disease, including PCI procedures. Heparin is manufactured and distributed by a number of companies as a generic product and is sold at a price that is significantly less than the price for Angiomax. Although their use may have decreased in recent years, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are widely used and some physicians believe they offer superior efficacy in high risk patients as compared to Angiomax.
In some circumstances, Angiomax competes with other anticoagulant drugs for the use of hospital financial resources. For example, many U.S. hospitals receive a fixed reimbursement amount per procedure for the angioplasties and other treatment procedures they perform. As this amount is not based on the actual expenses the hospital incurs, hospitals may choose to use either Angiomax or heparin or a combination of heparin and a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor but not necessarily more than one of these drugs.
Patents, Proprietary Rights and Licenses 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to protect the products we acquire or license by obtaining and maintaining patent protection both in the United States and in other countries. We rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations, contractual restrictions and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We plan to prosecute and defend patents or patent applications we file, acquire or license.
Inclisiran. We have exclusively licensed from Alnylam patents covering RNAi therapeutics targeting PCSK9 for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and other human diseases for purposes of developing and commercializing such RNAi therapeutics. Some of these patents are directed to general RNAi technology and expire between 2020 and 2028 in the United States. Other patents are directed to compositions of the inclisiran product being developed under our license from Alnylam and to methods of treatment using such inclisiran product and the patents expire in 2027 and 2028 in the United States. In addition, Alnylam has filed and is prosecuting a number of patent applications in the United States and in certain foreign countries. One of these applications, which, if issued, expires in December 2033, contains claims directed to specific compositions of the inclisiran product we are developing and methods of administrating such compositions.
Angiomax.  We have exclusively licensed from Biogen Idec and Health Research Inc., or HRI, patents and patent applications covering Angiomax and Angiomax analogs and other novel anticoagulants as compositions of matter, and processes for using Angiomax and Angiomax analogs and other novel anticoagulants. We also own two U.S. patents covering a more consistent and improved Angiomax drug product and the processes by which it is made. 
The principal U.S. patents covering Angiomax include the ‘727 patent and the ‘343 patent and previously included the ‘404 patent. The ‘404 patent covered the composition of matter of Angiomax.  The ‘404 patent was set to expire in March 2010, but the term was extended to December 15, 2014 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, under the Hatch-Waxman Act. As a result of our study of Angiomax in the pediatric setting, we had an additional six-month period of pediatric exclusivity following expiration of the ‘404 patent.  This period of exclusivity expired in June 2015.
In the second half of 2009, the PTO issued to us the ‘727 patent and the ‘343 patent, covering a more consistent and improved Angiomax drug product and the processes by which it is made. The ‘727 patent and the ‘343 patent are set to expire in July 2029, which includes pediatric exclusivity. In response to Paragraph IV Certification Notice letters we received with respect to ANDAs filed by a number of parties with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Angiomax, we have filed lawsuits against the ANDA filers alleging patent infringement of the ‘727 patent and ‘343 patent. We have settled our patent infringement litigations with Teva, APP, Sun, Dr. Reddy’s, Aurobindo Pharma Limited, Sagent Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Accord Healthcare Inc., but remain in infringement litigation involving the ‘727 patent and ‘343 patent with the other ANDA filers. Our patent infringement litigation involving the ‘727 patent and ‘343 patent and related settlements are described in more detail in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
In Europe, the principal patent covering Angiomax expired in August 2015. This patent covered the composition of matter of Angiomax. As a result, we do not have market exclusivity for Angiomax in Europe. We are in the process of voluntarily discontinuing and withdrawing Angiomax from the market outside of North America and ceasing related commercial activities.
Ionsys. As a result of our acquisition of Incline Therapeutics, Inc., or Incline, in 2013, we acquired a portfolio of patents and patent applications covering the Ionsys device and its uses.  Some of these patents and patent applications were exclusively licensed from ALZA.  The expiration dates of patents covering the Ionsys device and its use range from January 2019 to February 2033 in the United States. In Europe, the expiration dates of patents covering the Ionsys device and its use range from October 2019 to March 2033. We are also currently prosecuting patent applications relating to Ionsys in the United States and in certain foreign countries. In June 2017, we commenced a voluntary discontinuation and withdrawal of Ionsys from the market and ceased related commercialization activities, with the regulatory authorizations for Ionsys remaining open as we continue to explore opportunities to partner or divest Ionsys.

The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms like us can be uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know whether any of the patent applications we acquire, license or file will result in the issuance of patents or, if any patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or will be challenged, circumvented or invalidated. Because unissued U.S. patent applications filed prior to November 29, 2000 and patent applications filed within the last 18 months are maintained in secrecy until patents issue, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the PTO to determine priority of invention, or in opposition proceedings in a foreign patent office. Participation in these proceedings could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Even issued patents may not be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using such technology.
The development of hypercholesterolemia products and RNAi therapeutics are intensely competitive. A number of pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and research institutions have filed patent applications or received patents in these fields. Some of these patent applications could be competitive with applications we have acquired or licensed, or could conflict in certain respects with claims made under our applications. Such conflict could result in a significant reduction of the coverage of the patents we have acquired or licensed, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if patents are issued to other companies that contain competitive or conflicting claims with claims of our patents and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid, we may not be able to obtain licenses to these patents at a reasonable cost, or develop or obtain alternative technology.
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. However, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques. Others may also otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology. We may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and consultants, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be our exclusive property. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
We have a number of trademarks that we consider important to our business. The Medicines Company® name and logo, and Angiomax®, Angiox® and Ionsys® names and logos are either our registered trademarks or our trademarks in the United States and other countries. We have also registered some of these marks in a number of foreign countries. Although we have a foreign trademark registration program for selected marks, we may not be able to register or use such marks in each foreign country in which we seek registration. We believe that our products are identified by our trademarks and, thus, our trademarks are of significant value. Each registered trademark has a duration of 10 to 15 years, depending on the date it was registered and the country in which it is registered, and is subject to an infinite number of renewals for a like period upon continued use and appropriate application. We intend to continue the use of our trademarks and to renew our registered trademarks based upon each trademark’s continued value to us.
License Agreements
A summary of our licenses for our products and products in development is set forth below.
Alnylam License Agreement. In February 2013, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam to develop, manufacture and commercialize therapeutic products targeting the human PCSK9 gene based on certain of Alnylam’s RNAi technology. Under the terms of the agreement, we obtained the exclusive, worldwide right under Alnylam’s technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize PCSK9 products for the treatment, palliation and/or prevention of all human diseases. We paid Alnylam $25.0 million in an initial license payment and agreed to pay up to $180.0 million in success-based development and commercialization milestones. In December 2014, we paid a development milestone payment of $10.0 million based upon the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial for inclisiran and in January 2018 we paid a development milestone payment of $20 million in connection with the first dosing of a subject in a pivotal study for inclisiran. In addition, Alnylam will be eligible to receive scaled double-digit royalties based on annual worldwide net sales of PCSK9 products by us or our affiliates and sublicensees. Royalties to Alnylam are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the last to occur of the expiration of patent rights in the applicable country that cover the applicable product, the expiration of non-patent regulatory exclusivities for such product in such country, or the twelfth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. The royalties are subject to reduction in specified circumstances. We are also responsible for paying royalties, and in some cases milestone payments, owed by Alnylam to its licensors with respect to intellectual property covering these products.
 11

The agreement expires when the last royalty term expires under the agreement, unless earlier terminated. We may terminate the agreement at any time with four months prior written notice to Alnylam. Either party may terminate the agreement on 60 days (10 days in the event of a payment breach) prior written notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such breach within the applicable notice period. Such cure period may be extended in certain circumstances. If the agreement is terminated by us for convenience or by Alnylam for our uncured material breach or challenge of the patents licensed from Alnylam, we have agreed to grant a license to Alnylam under certain of its technology developed in the course of our activities under the agreement, subject to a royalty to be negotiated between the parties, and we will provide certain other assistance to Alnylam to continue the development and commercialization of the products. The exclusivity restrictions imposed on us will survive termination of the agreement for specified periods of time if we terminate the agreement for convenience or if Alnylam terminates the agreement for cause or for a patent challenge by us. 
Angiomax.  In March 1997, we entered into an agreement with Biogen, Inc., a predecessor of Biogen Idec, for the license of the anticoagulant pharmaceutical bivalirudin, which we have developed and market as Angiomax. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to the technology, patents, trademarks, inventories and know-how related to Angiomax. In exchange for the license, we paid $2.0 million on the closing date and are obligated to pay up to an additional $8.0 million upon the first commercial sales of Angiomax for the treatment of AMI in the United States and Europe. In addition, we are obligated to pay royalties on sales of Angiomax and on any sublicense royalties on a country-by-country basis earned until the later of the date 12 years after the date of the first commercial sales of the product in a country and the date on which the product or its manufacture, use or sale is no longer covered by a valid claim of the licensed patent rights in such country. The royalty rate due to Biogen Idec on sales increases as annual sales of Angiomax increase. Under the agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize Angiomax in specified European markets, including for PTCA and AMI indications. The license and rights under the agreement remain in force until our obligation to pay royalties ceases. As of December 15, 2014, we no longer owe royalties to Biogen Idec or HRI relating to sales of Angiomax in the United States. Either party may terminate the agreement for material breach by the other party, if the material breach is not cured within 90 days’ after written notice. In addition, we may terminate the agreement for any reason upon 90 days’ prior written notice. We are currently in a dispute with Biogen regarding Angiomax royalties under our license agreement; see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. During 2017, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in royalties related to Angiomax sales outside the United States under our agreement with Biogen Idec. 
In March 1997, in connection with entering into the Biogen Idec license, Biogen Idec assigned to us a license agreement with HRI under which Biogen Idec had licensed HRI’s right to a specified patent application held jointly with Biogen Idec which resulted in a series of U.S. patents including the ‘404 patent. Under the terms of the agreement, we have exclusive worldwide rights to HRI’s rights to the licensed patent application and patents arising from the licensed patent application, other than rights for noncommercial research and educational purposes, which HRI retained. We are obligated to pay royalties on sales of Angiomax and on any sublicense income we earn. The royalty rate due to HRI on sales increases as annual sales of Angiomax increase. Under the agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to research and develop, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize Angiomax. The license and rights under the agreement remain in force until the expiration of the last remaining patent granted under the licensed patent application. HRI may terminate the agreement for a material breach by us, if the material breach is not cured within 90 days after written notice or, in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation or insolvency, immediately on written notice. In addition, we may terminate the agreement for any reason upon 90 days’ prior written notice upon payment of a termination fee equal to the minimum royalty fee payable under the license agreement. As of December 15, 2014, we no longer owe royalties to HRI relating to sales of Angiomax in the United States. During 2017, we incurred approximately $0.2 million in royalties related to Angiomax sales outside the United States under the agreement with HRI. 
Ionsys. As a result of our acquisition of Incline, we are a party to a license agreement with ALZA through our Incline subsidiary. Under the terms of the agreement, Incline acquired from ALZA certain rights to the Ionsys product and ALZA transferred to Incline specified trademarks, know-how, domain names and tangible assets relating to the Ionsys product. ALZA also granted Incline worldwide licenses under specified patent rights and know-how to develop, manufacture and commercialize iontophoretic transdermal systems providing delivery under the influence of an electric current which is from a source external to the human body of specified fentanyl analogs. The licenses granted by ALZA under the agreement are exclusive with respect to specified patent rights and know-how and nonexclusive under other specified patent rights. 
We, through our subsidiary, Incline have the sole responsibility for the development and commercialization of licensed products under the agreement, and are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Spain.
In addition to the other rights and licenses granted to Incline under the ALZA Agreement, if, at any time during the 10-year period following the date of the agreement, ALZA wishes to grant a license under specified licensed patents to a third party, other than in connection with the settlement of litigation, to develop, manufacture and/or commercialize specified systems that deliver opioid compounds or combinations of opioid compounds with fentanyl analogs or generic compounds, in each case that do not 
 12

contain any active compound that is proprietary to, licensed by or otherwise controlled by the third party or, except for specified fentanyl analogs, by ALZA, then we will have a right of first negotiation to obtain the proposed license.
If, at any time during the 10-year period following the date of the agreement, we wish to obtain from ALZA a license under specified licensed patents to develop, manufacture and/or commercialize specified systems that deliver generic compounds, combinations of generic compounds with fentanyl analogs or compounds exclusively owned, licensed or otherwise controlled by Incline, alone or in combination with generic compounds or specified fentanyl analogs, in each case that do not contain any active compound, other than specified fentanyl analogs, that is proprietary to, licensed by or otherwise controlled by ALZA or that is a generic drug owned, licensed or controlled by ALZA, then upon notice to ALZA of our desire to obtain the license, ALZA will be obligated to negotiate in good faith with Incline to grant the proposed license.
Under the ALZA Agreement, Incline paid ALZA an upfront payment and we will be obligated to pay ALZA up to an aggregate of $32.5 million in regulatory and commercial launch milestone payments and up to an aggregate of $83.0 million in sales milestone payments if certain specified milestones are met. ALZA is also entitled to specified royalties based on net sales of licensed products, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, during the period commencing on the first commercial sale of the licensed product in the applicable country and ending on the latest of the expiration of the licensed patents covering the licensed product, the expiration of applicable regulatory exclusivity or the 20th anniversary of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in the applicable country. We will also be required to pay amounts that become payable, if any, under specified ALZA third party licenses as a result of our development and commercialization of licensed products.
Either ALZA or we may terminate the agreement due to the other party’s material breach of the agreement if such breach is not cured within 60 days of notice of the breach except that if the breach relates solely to the United States, any country in Europe or any other country in the world, the termination right shall apply to the United States, applicable countries in Europe or the rest of the world (other than the US and Europe), as the case may be. ALZA may also terminate the agreement due to our bankruptcy. Neither party has any discretionary right to terminate the agreement. If not terminated earlier pursuant to its terms, the agreement terminates upon the expiration and satisfaction of all payment obligations under the agreement.
Although we continue to seek a partnership or divestiture transaction for Ionsys, in June 2017, we commenced a voluntary discontinuation and withdrawal of Ionsys from the market and ceased related commercialization activities, with the regulatory authorizations for Ionsys remaining open.
Customers
In the United States, we currently sell branded Angiomax, and we sold Minocin IV and Orbactiv until our divesture of the products to Melinta in January 2018, to our sole source distributor, ICS. ICS accounted for 5%, 48% and 87% of our net product revenue for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, amounts due from ICS represented approximately $2.9 million and $2.2 million, or 27% and 11%, of gross accounts receivable, respectively. We also have a supply and distribution arrangement with Sandoz under which Sandoz sells authorized generic Angiomax (bivalirudin) in the United States. We generate total net revenue under the sales and distribution arrangement with Sandoz by making products sales to Sandoz (which is recorded in net product revenues) and receiving royalty payments from Sandoz in respect of Sandoz’s sales of authorized generic Angiomax (bivalirudin) (which is recorded in royalty revenues). Product sales to Sandoz accounted for 55% and 23% of our net product revenues for 2017 and 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, amounts due from Sandoz related to product sales were approximately $0.9 million or 8% and $5.6 million or 27%, respectively, of gross accounts receivable. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, amounts due from Sandoz related to royalty revenues represented approximately $4.2 million or 40% and $9.1 million or 43%, respectively, of gross accounts receivable. 
Government Regulation 
Government authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate the research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, advertising, promotion, storage, sales, distribution, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our products and product candidates. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologics, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act respectively and their implementing regulations. We cannot market or commercially distribute a drug until we have submitted an application for marketing authorization to the FDA, and the FDA has approved it. Both before and after approval is obtained, violations of regulatory requirements may result in various adverse consequences, including, among other things, clinical holds, untitled letters, warning letters, fines and other monetary penalties, the FDA’s delay in approving or refusal to approve a product, product recall or seizure, suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, interruption of production, operating restrictions, injunctions and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. The steps required before a drug may be approved by the FDA and marketed in the United States generally include:

• | pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies;

 13


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.

Pre-Clinical Tests
Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, clinical study protocol(s), and other information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA puts the trial on clinical hold because of concerns or questions about issues such as the design of the clinical trial(s) or the safety of the drug for administration to humans. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. Submission of an IND does not necessarily result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. In addition, the FDA may impose a clinical hold at any time which includes during an ongoing clinical trial if, for example, safety concerns arise, in which case the trial cannot recommence without the FDA’s authorization. A clinical hold can result in a substantial delay and expense.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring subject safety, and the effectiveness criteria, or endpoints, to be evaluated. Each protocol intended to study investigational new drugs in the United States must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and the FDA may or may not allow that trial to proceed. Each trial also must be reviewed and approved by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, at each proposed study site before it can begin.
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. 

• | Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into people to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.


• | Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to: evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific indications. 


• | Phase 3 trials usually involve administration of the drug to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to evaluate safety, and statistically evaluate the efficacy of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.

We cannot guarantee that Phase 3 testing of inclisiran will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. Furthermore, we, the IRB, or the FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
Sponsors are required to publicly disseminate information about ongoing and completed clinical trials on a government website administered by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and are subject to civil money penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions for failing to meet these obligations.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical studies and of the clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of an NDA or BLA typically requires the payment of a significant user fee to FDA. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs or BLAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. If the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Before approving an application, the FDA 
 14

usually will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured, and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA also often inspects one or more sites at which the pivotal clinical trial or trials were conducted to ensure the integrity of the data and compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements. If the FDA determines the application, data or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, the FDA may outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If the FDA evaluation of the NDA and the various inspections are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter, which authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for a specific indication. As a condition of approval of an application, the FDA may request or require post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. The FDA also may impose requirements designed to ensure the safety of the drug up to and including distribution and use restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS. After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval before the changes can be implemented. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Product approvals may be further limited or withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or safety or other problems are identified following initial marketing.
The FDA regulates combinations of products that cross FDA centers, such as drug, biologic or medical device components that are physically, chemically or otherwise combined into a single entity, as a combination product. The FDA center with primary jurisdiction for the combination product will take the lead in the premarket review of the product, with the other center consulting or collaborating with the lead center, and often will require approval of only a single application, such as an NDA or BLA. The FDA’s Office of Combination Products, or OCP, determines which center will have primary jurisdiction for the combination product based on the combination product’s “primary mode of action.” A mode of action is the means by which a product achieves an intended therapeutic effect or action. The primary mode of action is the mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product, or the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product. 
Manufacturing Requirements
After the FDA approves a product, we, our suppliers, and our contract manufacturers must comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approved NDA or BLA are required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, we and our contract manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. In addition, discovery of problems such as safety problems may result in changes in labeling, imposition or modification of a REMS, or other restrictions on a product manufacturer, or NDA or BLA holder, including removal of the product from the market.
We use and will continue to use third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and we cannot be sure that future FDA inspections will not identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Also, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications and Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
Once an NDA is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a listed drug that can, in turn, be relied upon by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. The FDA may approve an ANDA if the product is the same in important respects as the listed drug or if the FDA has declared it suitable for an ANDA submission. In these situations, applicants must submit studies showing that the product is bioequivalent to the listed drug, meaning that the rate and extent of absorption of the drug does not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Conducting bioequivalence studies is generally less time-consuming and costly than conducting pre-clinical and clinical trials necessary to support an NDA or BLA. Drugs approved via ANDAs on the basis that they are the “same” as a listed drug are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be and are substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. A number of ANDAs have been filed and approved with respect to Angiomax. The regulations governing marketing exclusivity and patent protection are complex, and until the outcomes of our effort to extend the patent term and our patent infringement litigation, we may not know the disposition of such ANDA submissions.
 15

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. An ANDA applicant relying upon a listed drug is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the listed drug product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 

• | the required patent information has not been filed;


• | the listed patent has expired;


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the new product.

A certification that the proposed generic product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification notice automatically prevents the FDA from granting final approval to the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
The ANDA also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity period, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, for the referenced product has expired, unless the exclusivity period protects an indication or other aspect of labeling that can be “carved out” of the labeling for the proposed generic product. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active moiety during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA if a listed drug contains a previously approved active moiety but FDA requires as a condition of approval new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination, or indication. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, federal law also provides that periods of patent and non-patent marketing exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for a drug may be extended by six months if the NDA sponsor conducts pediatric studies identified by the FDA in a written request. For written requests issued by the FDA after September 27, 2007, the date of enactment of the Food and Drug Administrative Amendment Act (FDAAA), the FDA must grant pediatric exclusivity no later than nine months prior to the date of expiration of patent or non-patent exclusivity in order for the six-month pediatric extension to apply to that exclusivity period. 
Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application. 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication(s) sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would be required to do so. As a result, approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be prevented until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.

Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act
Under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, enacted in the United States in 2010, the FDA now has the authority to approve biosimilar and interchangeable versions of previously-approved biological products through an abbreviated pathway following periods of data and marketing exclusivity. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to show its molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic, also known as a reference product, address the challenges of biologics manufacturing, and include a certain amount of safety and efficacy data which the FDA will evaluate on a case-by-case basis. A competitor seeking approval of an interchangeable biological product must demonstrate not only biosimilarity but also that the products can be expected to produce the same clinical effects in any given patient. Under the data protection provisions of this law, the FDA cannot accept a biosimilar application until four years, or approve a biosimilar application until 12 years, after initial marketing approval of the reference product. Although the FDA has issued draft guidance documents, to date it has not issued any regulations or final guidance explaining how it will implement the abbreviated BLA or biosimilar provisions enacted in 2010 under the BPCIA, including the exclusivity provisions for reference products. Regulators in the European Union and other countries also have been given the authority to approve biosimilars. The extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be approved as interchangeable with or substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biologic products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. A number of states have recently considered and, in some cases, adopted legislation governing the substitution of interchangeable biosimilars for the reference product.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, which was amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. The PPACA, as amended, contains numerous provisions that impact the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries and it empowers the HHS to implement a number of related healthcare reform measures that are likely to have a broad impact on the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry. We are continually evaluating the impact of the PPACA and other healthcare reform-related programs and regulations on our business, including potential PPACA repeal and replacement. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not identified any provisions that currently materially impact our business and results of operations. However, the potential impact of the PPACA and other healthcare reform measures on our business and results of operations is inherently difficult to predict because many of the details regarding the implementation of this legislation have not been determined. In addition, the impact on our business and results of operations may change as and if our business evolves. On December 22, 2017, Congress passed and President Trump signed bill entitled “To provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018,” which, among other things, repealed the PPACA individual mandate. President Trump and HHS Secretary Azar have announced support for regulatory provisions that would limit PPACA and number of healthcare reform programs initiated under the Obama administration. It remains unclear whether replacement programs will include similar limitations affecting reimbursement, although scrutiny over drug pricing and government costs is expected to continue. Similarly, efforts in Congress to reform Medicare and Medicaid may impact the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of inclisiran, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the product will be covered by third-party payers, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive health economic studies in order to demonstrate the economics of the product, in addition to incurring the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Even if a drug product is covered, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and economic benefit of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payers do not consider inclisiran to be economically beneficial compared to other available therapies, they may not cover it after approval as a benefit under their plans. Third-party payers may provide coverage, but place stringent limitations on such coverage, such as requiring alternative treatments to be tried first. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign 
 17

governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.
Pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of inclisiran to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for inclisiran.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Foreign Regulations
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee for each clinical trial, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the clinical trial may proceed in that country.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA or BLA in the United States is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Drugs can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralised authorisation procedure or national authorization procedures.
Centralised EMA Procedure.  The EMA, formerly the EMEA, implemented the centralised procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorisations that are valid throughout the European Union. This procedure results in a single marketing authorisation issued by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralised procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are derived from biotechnology processes, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines.
 18

For drugs that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralised marketing authorisation to the EMA, as long as the drug concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
National Procedures.  There are also three other possible routes to authorize medicinal products outside the scope of the centralised procedure and the EMA:

• | National procedures. A medicine is authorised in one European Union member state in accordance with the national procedures of that country. If a marketing authorisation holder wishes to apply subsequently for additional marketing authorisations in other member states for that product, the mutual recognition procedure must be used.


• | Decentralised procedure. Using the decentralised procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralised procedure. 


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union member state, in accordance with the national procedures of that country, as described above. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 

Research and Development 
Our research and development expenses, excluding discontinued operations, totaled $138.4 million in 2017, $92.1 million in 2016 and $90.4 million in 2015.
Employees
As of February 28, 2018 we employed approximately 170 persons worldwide. We believe that our success depends greatly on our ability to identify, attract and retain capable employees. We have assembled a management team with significant experience in drug development and commercialization. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit, and we believe our relations with our employees are good. 
Workforce Restructuring
In 2017 and 2018, we conducted a series of workforce reductions, as described below. Our intention is to reduce our personnel to less than 60 employees as we announced in October 2017. Upon signing release agreements, affected employees have received, or are eligible to receive, a severance package, including reduction payments and fully paid health care coverage and outplacement services for six months to a year.
In June 2017, in connection with our voluntary discontinuation and withdrawal of Ionsys from the market in the United States, we commenced a workforce reduction, which resulted in the reduction of 57 employees, representing approximately 15% of our workforce. 
Commencing in December 2017 and continuing through 2018, we are implementing a series of workforce reductions to focus on inclisiran, improve efficiencies and better align costs and structure. All employees who will be impacted by these reductions have been informed as to their respective timing of their departures. Through February 27, 2018, 27 employees have been terminated and 136 employees were transferred as part of the sale of the infectious disease business unit to Melinta. An additional 115 employees will be terminated through the remainder of the year, with the vast majority by midyear. Included in the 115 employees are 23 employees based in San Diego who are working on early stage infectious disease projects. We expect to sell or spin out those assets and employees by midyear. These workforce reductions are expected to reduce headcount costs included in operating expenses by approximately $74.0 million on an annualized basis. 
Segments and Geographic Information
We have one reportable segment. For information regarding revenue and other information regarding our results of operations, including geographic segment information, for each of our last three fiscal years, please refer to our consolidated financial statements and Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Part II, Item 8.
