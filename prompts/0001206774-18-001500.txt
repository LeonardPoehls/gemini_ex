ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Union Acquisition Corp.
 Introduction
 We are a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated on November 14, 2017 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization, or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a “target business”. Our efforts to identify a target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to focus our search for a target business located in Latin America.
 In December 2017, we issued an aggregate of 2,875,000 ordinary shares (“Founders’ Shares”) to Kyle P. Bransfield, our Chief Executive Officer, and Union Group International Holdings Limited (“UGI”), an affiliate of Juan Sartori, our Chairman of the Board, for aggregate consideration of $25,000 in cash, or approximately $0.01 per share, in connection with our organization. Mr. Bransfield and UGI subsequently transferred a portion of the Founders’ Shares to certain individuals and entities, including our independent directors, for the same purchase price originally paid for such shares. The Founders’ Shares included an aggregate of 375,000 shares that were subject to forfeiture if the underwriters’ over-allotment option was not exercised in full in our initial public offering (“IPO”). As a result of the underwriters’ election to exercise their over-allotment option in full, 375,000 Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.
 Initial Public Offering
 On March 2, 2018, we consummated our IPO of 11,500,000 units, including 1,500,000 units which were subject to the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters of the IPO, with each unit consisting of one ordinary share, one right, and one redeemable warrant. Each right is exchangeable for one-tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share upon the consummation of our initial business combination. Each warrant will become exercisable on the later of the completion of an initial business combination or March 2, 2019 and will expire on the fifth anniversary of our completion of an initial business combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The ordinary shares, rights, and warrants included in the units traded as a unit until March 19, 2018 when separate trading of ordinary shares, rights, and warrants began. Holders now have the option to continue to hold units or separate their units into the component pieces. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000.
 Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement of 5,200,000 warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per warrant, generating total proceeds of $5,200,000. The Private Placement Warrants were purchased by certain of our initial shareholders. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the warrants included in the units sold in the IPO except that the Private Placement Warrants: (i) are not redeemable by us and (ii) are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or any of their permitted transferees. Additionally, the purchasers of the Private Placement Warrants have agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination.

We paid a total of $2,300,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions at the closing of the IPO and $424,997 for other costs and expenses related to our formation and the IPO. After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the offering expenses, the total net proceeds to us from the IPO and simultaneous private placement were approximately $117,475,000. Of these amounts, $116,150,000 was deposited into a trust account established in connection with the IPO, and approximately $1,325,000 became available to be used to provide for business, legal, and accounting due diligence on prospective target businesses and continuing general and administrative expenses. We may withdraw from the trust account interest earned on the funds held therein necessary to pay our income taxes, if any, and for our working capital purposes. Except as described above, these funds will not be released to us until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation upon our failure to consummate a business combination within the required time period (which may not occur until August 21, 2019).
