 Corporate History and Overview 
 We are a U.S.-based exploration and development company that had been focused on the acquisition and development potential of lithium brines and other precious metals that demonstrate high probability for near-term production. Currently the company is focused testing its SonCav Technology for use in the oil and gas industry and the acquisition of oil and gas related assets in Western Canada and Southwest Louisiana. We were incorporated on May 31, 2006 in the State of Nevada under the name Mariposa Resources, Ltd. Effective November 30, 2010, we changed our name to Lithium Exploration Group, Inc., by way of a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary Lithium Exploration Group, Inc., which was formed solely for the change of name. 
 Our executive offices are located at 4635 South Lakeshore Drive, Suite 200, Tempe, AZ 85282-7127. The telephone number for our Tempe office is (480) 641-4790. 
 On October 18, 2013, we completed, through our then wholly owned subsidiary, Alta Disposal Ltd. (formerly 1617437 Alberta Ltd.), an Alberta, Canada corporation, the acquisition of 51% of the shares of Blue Tap Resources Inc. for total payment of CAD$466,547. As of September 30, 2013, CAD$300,000 (US$294,908) was paid regarding the acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, Blue Tap Resources Inc. became a partially-owned subsidiary of our company through our wholly owned subsidiary, Alta Disposal Ltd. On January 22, 2014, Blue Tap Resources Inc. changed its name to Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd. Effective September 4, 2015, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Cancen Oil Canada whereby we sold all right, title and interest of Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd. assets for total purchase price of CAD$10,000 (approximately USD$7,531). 
 On August 20, 2013, we entered into a letter of intent with Tero Oilfield Services Ltd. (Tero), a private company, pursuant to which Tero agreed to sell up to 75% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Tero to our company in exchange for payment in the amount of $1,500,000. 
 On March 1, 2014, Alta Disposal, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a share purchase agreement with Tero and Garry Hofmann, the sole shareholder of Tero. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Hofmann agreed to sell and we agreed to purchase 50% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Tero in exchange for an aggregate of CAD$1,000,000. As part of the share purchase by Alta Disposal, on February 22, 2014, Tero declared a dividend in the amount of $307,104, payable to Mr. Hofmann by way of a promissory note. As a result of the share purchase agreement, Tero is now a partially owned (50%) subsidiary of our company. Additionally, Alta Disposal, Tero and Mr. Hofmann entered into an option agreement entitling Alta Disposal to purchase up to an additional 25% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Tero from Mr. Hofmann, exercisable at a price of $500,000 for a period of one year. On May 1, 2015, our company entered into a share purchase agreement with an individual and disposed of our 50% interest in Tero in consideration for $300,000. 
 On October 17, 2014, we amended our Articles of Incorporation, which amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on October 17, 2014, to increase the authorized capital of our common shares from 500,000,000 common shares, par value $0.001, to 2,000,000,000 common shares, par value $0.001. Our authorized capital consists of 2,000,000,000 common shares and 100,000,000 preferred shares, all with a par value of $0.001. 
 On January 19, 2015, we received written consent from our Board of Directors to implement a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a basis of 20 old shares of common stock for 1 new share of common stock. Stockholders of our company originally approved the reverse stock split on October 14, 2014 at a special meeting. The reverse stock split was reviewed and approved for filing by FINRA, effective February 25, 2015, and we were assigned CUSIP number 53680P209, effective that same date. Our authorized capital was not affected by the reverse stock split.

On June 22, 2015, in accordance with our Articles of Incorporation, our Board of Directors designated 250,000 of our 100,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred Stock as Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.001, (the Series A Preferred). The Series A Preferred ranks senior to our common stock, carrying general voting rights with the common stock at the rate of 62 votes per Series A Preferred share. The Series A Preferred will be deemed cancelled within one year of issuance and are not entitled to share in dividends or other distributions. So long as any shares of Series A Preferred are outstanding, the affirmative vote of not less than 75% of those outstanding shares of Series A Preferred will be required for any change to our Articles of Incorporation. As of June 30, 2017, there are zero shares of Series A Preferred outstanding. 
 On July 9, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a settlement agreement dated June 25, 2015 among our company, JDF Capital Inc., and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Alta Disposal Ltd. Previously, pursuant to a general security agreement dated July 22, 2014, JDF Capital Inc. was granted a first-ranking security interest over all current and future assets of Alta Disposal Ltd., in full guarantee of a $708,000 loan to our Company. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, JDF Capital Inc. and its assign, Blue Citi LLC, agreed to release and discharge their general security interest in consideration of the issuance of 130,000 shares of Series A Preferred. These shares were subsequently cancelled on December 5, 2015. 
 On July 13, 2015, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our authorized capital from 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001, to 10,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value of $0.001 per share, and a reverse stock split on a basis of up to 200 old shares of common stock for 1 share of common stock. The increase of authorized capital and stock split was approved by shareholders on July 13, 2015. A Definitive Schedule 14C was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on August 6, 2015. On September 9, 2015, we filed with the Nevada Secretary of State a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation increasing our authorized capital from 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001, to 10,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value of $0.001 per share. The reverse stock split was reviewed and approved for filing by FINRA, effective September 30, 2015, and we were assigned CUSIP number 53680P308, effective that same date. 
 Other than as set out herein, we have not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, nor have we been a party to any material reclassification, merger, consolidation or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of our business. 
 Disclosure Adjustments for Reverse Stock Split 
 On January 19, 2015, our board of directors consented to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a basis of 20 old shares of common stock for one 1 new share of common stock.

 Our Business 
 We are a U.S.-based exploration and development company that had been focused on the acquisition and development potential of lithium brines and other precious metals that demonstrate high probability for near-term production. Currently, the company is focused on testing the SonCav Technology for potential use in mining, oil and gas and other industrial applications in the future. In addition, the Company is focused on the acquisition of oil and gas related assets in North America.

SonCav Technology 
 The SonCav technology uses a patented process to mechanically induce an ultrasonic cavitation to superheat fluid. Our testing and development has historically been focused solely on water and crude oil, but technology is expected to have many other commercial uses including mining, LNG, Ethanol, industrial and other chemical uses in the pharmaceutical industry. A cavitation is the implosion of a microbubble in fluid which causes an ultrasonic reaction capable of generating intense heat in a millisecond and releasing ultrasonic soundwaves that have the ability to actually break molecules down in the process. In a water application, the SonCav technology can eliminate toxic organic compounds in brackish water or be used to superheat fluid inducing a flash evaporation, separating suspended solids from the fluid stock. In an oil application, the induced cavitation can be used to heat an oil emulsion, separating trapped gas and water in the oil so that it can be sold. Through harnessing the ultrasound released by the cavitation reaction, the technology can also break the hydrocarbon chain assisting in forming new lighter hydrocarbon compounds in the same body of fluid. 
 SonCavs features and benefits include: 
 
 | No combustion of natural gas, thereby limiting on-site emissions and EPA regulatory hurdles; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Lower operating cost due to more efficient heat transfer and circulation; 
 | Ability to retrofit to any tank configuration for addition of heat to separating operation; 
 | Lower maintenance costs and extended life due to reduction of corrosive compounds and waste build-up inside walls of tank; and 
 | Increased volume of salable oil due to effective incorporation of carbon constituents. 

 There are three primary applications for the SonCav technology in mining, oil and gas and other industrial applications. 
 Mining Exploration and Development
The first is simply assisting in cleaning up water-based waste streams that are costly to transport to a place where they can be appropriately handled or disposed. The technology can assist by treating the waste on site by lowering the volume of fluid to be disposed and reducing the environmental liability of transporting fluid waste as opposed to dry waste. 
 We are presently focused on the testing of the SonCav technology, but as we develop commercial units, we expect to explore opportunities in Canada that can see the greatest benefit from the use of SonCav. Using the technology for the extraction of lithium and other minerals from existing underground brine is a focus of our mineral extraction and mining goals. There are many known areas of Alberta that have mineral rich brine that is being brought to the surface in the production of oil and that is a waste by-product to the oil and gas producers. We believe we can find opportunities to use the SonCav technology to treat economically viable waste streams and to generate revenue from the sale of the extracted minerals. 
 We believe that solution mining for potash and other valuable chlorides is also a target market. Solution mining is the use of fresh water injection to underground salt beds to dissolve the salts then bring the brine solution to the surface to extract the valuable minerals. In many cases, the use of solution mining is significantly cheaper and less risky than creating an underground mine using elevators and laborers. The SonCav technology can significantly reduce the pipeline expense for solution mining efforts because it enables the operator to recycle the water that is used in the process in lieu of disposing it and having to bring in fresh water from regional lakes and rivers. 
 The final target for our mining efforts is to identify mining operations across Canada that have environmental issues, either in the clean-up of fluid waste streams or in areas where they cannot access enough fresh water to manage their mining and processing activities. These operations generally are at significant risk of being shut down and represent good market opportunities for SonCav to potentially solve their operating problems. 
 7

Oil and Gas
A central application of SonCav is the heating of produced crude oil before it reaches a refinery for further processing and storage and transportation. Produced oil comes out of the ground as an emulsion, which is comprised of a fluid that has oil, gas, and water all mixed together. Producers use a combination of gravity separation, chemical separation, and heat separation to capture the three streams, with the oil and gas being sold and the water being disposed of generally in underground disposal wells. All three of the separation techniques result in water falling to the bottom, oil separating in the center, and the lighter natural gas settling on top. The most efficient technique historically has been to speed up the natural separation by inducing heat which forces the three streams to separate out more quickly than just letting the gravity of the fluids break them apart over time. This process speeds up production rates, thus allowing for quicker sales. Chemically induced separation has come a long way over the past 20 years and, while historically it has been very expensive, it is becoming a part of most oil and gas production to assist in the separation process. 
 Traditionally the use of heat for treating oil emulsion has been induced by the combustion of natural gas through a metal tube that runs inside of the fluid body, then transferring that heat to the fluid thereby heating it and speeding up the separation. The heating application has been under a lot of scrutiny in recent years due to more stringent environmental and safety regulations. Heating oil as part of production has historically been overlooked as a cost of doing business but now, due to regulation and technological advancements, producers are being forced to look to other techniques in their day to day operations. Some of the new environmental laws calculate emissions created from the combustion as part of a producers carbon footprint. The SonCav technology uses grid electricity to affect heat being created by the cavitation reaction inside of the body of fluid and is considered to be zero emissions in all jurisdictions. It can also be retrofitted to existing separation infrastructure, reducing the up-front expense incurred by the operator. 
 The storage and transportation companies, also known as midstreamers, that are responsible for collecting the oil from producers and transporting it to the refineries have a very acute need for a technology like SonCav. In many regions, they are forced to circulate, heat, and add chemicals to crude oil to limit the paraffin waxes and heavier parts of the hydrocarbon chain that will drop out of the oil. These paraffin waxes and heavy oil particles are expensive to remove and can cause serious issues with their tank and pipeline infrastructure. Most pipeline operators will bring the oil out of the ground every 30 to 40 miles to heat the oil again before sending it on to the next terminal. This constant heating of oil can become very expensive and can cause them problems with emissions laws in certain jurisdictions where their only other option is to add very cost prohibitive chemicals. The SonCav technology can be used at tank farms and terminals to reduce the need for combustion of natural gas and costly chemicals. 
 At the drill site, the SonCav unit can be installed to intake the oil and frac-water mixture as it comes out of the ground and separate it using a flash evaporation process. The goal is to separate the sand, chemical and oil mixture from the flowback water that is a waste byproduct in the fracturing process. By doing this, the fresh water can be recycled and reused in future well-drilling efforts and take the dewatered solids away to be disposed of. By dewatering solid waste, the trucking companies are hauling significantly less solid waste that is a significantly less risky product to move over the road. In some geographic locations, these waste sands from oil and gas production contain valuable minerals like lithium, magnesium, and potassium which can be further processed and sold. 
 Other Industrial Markets
In Canada, there are many regions that have drought issues and struggle to provide enough fresh water to accommodate residential, agricultural, industrial, and oil and gas industry needs. These areas could use the technology simply to provide fresh water to support all of these needs by treating brackish water that cannot otherwise be used. The issues around drought conditions are the water levels of local rivers, lakes, and underground fresh water aquifers. Nearly all of the regions affected by these drought conditions have shallow aquifers of water but it has too much salinity to be used in many necessary applications. Regional facilities could be put in place to treat brackish water to eliminate some of the toxic organic compounds and reduce the overall salinity to levels where it could be used to water crops and potentially provide potable water for residential needs. 
 8

There are also significant needs in an industrial setting to clean up waste that for years has been placed back into local rivers or into underground disposal wells. The options for expanding businesses that are not grandfathered into some of these older disposal techniques are limited. We believe that the SonCav unit can solve acute waste issues for these industrial settings. Even the companies that have licenses to dump waste streams into fresh water river systems are constantly considering eliminating this practice by looking at technologies like the one that SonCav provides.
 Acquisition of Oil and Gas Assets 
 Our current oil and gas activities are limited to the following: 
 McKean County, Pennsylvania
On September 9, 2016, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Black Box Energy, Inc., in the State of Nevada (BBE). On September 9, 2016, through BBE, we entered into a letter agreement with PetroChase, Inc. pursuant to which we agreed to purchase 50% of a 70% net revenue interest held by PetroChase in a certain oil and gas lease known as the McKean County Project, located in McKean County, Pennsylvania. In consideration for the working interest, we paid $250,000 to PetroChase in equal installments on September 9, 2016 and September 16, 2016. We were required, but did not pay, an additional $30,000 to PetroChase for management fees by December 16, 2016. 
 Pursuant to the letter agreement, we will be entitled to recoup 100% of net revenue derived from the lease until we have recouped 100% of the $280,000 paid in consideration of the working interest. The agreement provides that PetroChase will serve as the operator and drill contractor for the project. The drilling of an initial well on the property was scheduled for fall of 2016. As at the date of this report, we are in dispute with PetroChase regarding its failure to drill a well in accordance with the agreement, and have given PetroChase notice of breach of contract. We have therefore indefinitely postponed delivery of the $30,000 management fee until this issue has been resolved. 
 Sulphur, Louisiana
On April 13, 2017, BBE entered into a Joint Development and Option Agreement with White Top Oil & Gas, LLC (White Top), a Louisiana limited liability company (the White Top Agreement), under which White Top is the designee to a funding agreement to finance and participate in the completion of certain oil and gas development, exploration and operating activities on certain lands located in Sulphur, Louisiana (the White Top Field). Under the terms of the White Top Agreement, BBE has advanced approximately $819,000 to White Top as consideration to White Top for the option to convert those funds into a 3% gross royalty from the future revenue at the Sulphur, Louisiana oil and gas property. BBE also has the right to repayment of the advanced funds if it does not believe the revenue from the royalty will be substantial enough. White Tops rights to repayment of the monies received from BBE expired on August 1, 2017. 
 White Top has until May 15, 2018 to acquire the field in Sulphur, LA. In the interim they have the option to drill development wells on the property to prove up additional reserves in the field before completing the acquisition. BBE has hired an independent seismic analyst as well as a geophysical team to review the work by the White Top team and is comfortable with how they are progressing. Ultimately the goal is to bring a SonCav technology unit to the field in Sulphur for onsite testing of the technology and to be used as a showroom for potential Canadian customers to see the unit in operation. 
 Research and Development 
 We currently have no research and development activities.

Competition 
 Production Technology/Liquid Heating Technology 
 There are many competitors in the water treatment and production technology industry. It is a very fragmented and competitive market where we compete with many small regional service providers and a handful of multinational companies like General Electric, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes. Every application of the technology noted above has an acute regional need. Some of these needs are because of operational logistics and some are created by regulatory mandates. 
 Because of this regional dynamic, smaller companies are often able to provide a more specialized need for their customers, although these needs generally do not involve high levels of technological breakthroughs. Regional service providers generally can take other off the shelf technologies and assemble them for a specific clients needs. By tailoring a solution for a client, smaller service providers can often provide better overall service for a customer and still be price competitive with the multinationals. Another reason for the fragmented regional market is because many applications for which we are providing solutions have very high transportation costs that make it cost prohibitive or logistically difficult to build something and ship it more than a couple hundred miles. 
 Larger conglomerates have substantial sales and marketing infrastructure with substantial R&D budgets which allow them to be the leaders of innovation in the space. This can be seen in the areas of water treatment as well as oil and gas production technology development. When it comes to innovation, these larger companies dominate the market but are limited by scale issues. For a new technology to make a meaningful financial impact it has to sell these new advanced technologies to large regional and multinational clients. 
 Our competitive advantage in both of these markets is that we are innovating a technology that can be implemented anywhere. Most of the applications for the technology simply utilize a generator that can be shipped anywhere in Canada then inserted into existing infrastructure. As a smaller company, we have limited R&D funds but also have designed the technology so that we can sell it to smaller operators with acute needs and still have good financial results. 
 Below is a list of existing technology that is currently used to heat fluids and treat industrial waste streams. These technological pieces can be used on their own or together depending on the need of the end customer. 
 
 | Natural Gas Combustion  This is where the combustion of natural gas is used to transfer heat through a fire tube that runs through a body of fluid which transfers heat to the fluid. This is not a highly scientific process and is used by smaller and larger competitors. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Chemical Additives  Chemicals are used to induce separation of compounds, neutralize organic impurities, and generally as a catalyst for other types of separation or treatment applications. 
 | Centrifuges  Centrifuges are used to spin fluid and use the gravity of certain compounds to dewater or separate heavier compounds from lighter ones. 
 | Filtration Systems  Filters and reverse osmosis is also generally used in conjunction with other applications and while it is extremely expensive to replace and clean filters on a large scale they can be built to target specific size impurities as part of a broader treatment set up. 
 | Steam Circulation  Steam has been used as a recycle heat exchange tool to make other forms of heating water to make the overall treatment more effective. This is generally used in conjunction with natural gas combustion where the steam generated from the water heating is recirculated back into the system to add heat and assist in separation or concentration of the fluid stock. 
 | Gravity Separation  Gravity separation is a simple form of separation of oil or water where the heaviest compounds are dropped to the bottom and the lighter ends are siphoned off over time and is generally used in conjunction with smaller amounts of heat input or chemical additives. 
 | Evaporation  Evaporation is used in many rural areas or arid climates where the waste stream can sit for a long period of time allowing the waste stream to simply condense into a dewatered solid that can be further treated or disposed. 

Oil and Gas Industry 
 The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with numerous other oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Some of these companies have substantially greater resources than we have. Not only do they explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also many carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. The operations of other companies may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties. They may also have more resources to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. 
 10

Our larger or integrated competitors may be better able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to federal, state, and local laws and regulations than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to discover reserves and acquire additional properties in the future will be dependent upon our ability and resources to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. In addition, we may be at a disadvantage in producing oil and natural gas properties and bidding for exploratory prospects, because we have fewer and limited financial and human resources than other companies in our industry. Should a larger and better financed company decide to directly compete with us, and be successful in its efforts, our business could be adversely affected. 
 The market for oil and natural gas that will be produced from our properties depends on factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas, the proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation facilities, demand for oil and natural gas, the marketing of competitive fuels and the effects of state and federal regulation. The oil and natural gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. 
 Our oil production is expected to be sold at prices tied to the spot oil markets. Our natural gas production is expected to be sold under short-term contracts and priced based on first of the month index prices or on daily spot market prices. We rely on our operating partners to market and sell our production. Our operating partners include a variety of exploration and production companies, from large publicly-traded companies to small, privately-owned companies. We do not believe the loss of any single operator would have a material adverse effect on our company as a whole. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We own the trademark Lithium Exploration Group for the use of mining exploration, namely, lithium exploration services, in class 42 (U.S. CLS. 100 and 101). The registration number is 4,075,565 and was registered on December 20, 2011. We do not have any other intellectual property. 
Government Approvals and Regulations 
 Regulations Pertaining to Our Mining Operations 
 Any operations at our lithium properties will be subject to various federal and state laws and regulations in Canada which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We will be required to obtain those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct exploration and other programs. There are no current orders or directions relating to us or to our lithium properties with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations. Such compliance may include feasibility studies on the surface impact of our proposed operations, costs associated with minimizing surface impact, water treatment and protection, reclamation activities, including rehabilitation of various sites, on-going efforts at alleviating the mining impact on wildlife and permits or bonds as may be required to ensure our compliance with applicable regulations. It is possible that the costs and delays associated with such compliance could become so prohibitive that we may decide to not proceed with exploration, development, or mining operations on any of our mineral properties. We are not presently aware of any specific material environmental constraints affecting our properties that would preclude the economic development or operation of property in Canada. 
Regulations Pertaining to Our Oil and Gas Operations 
 Our operations are subject to various rules, regulations and limitations impacting the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry as whole. 
 11

Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Production
Our oil and natural gas exploration, production and related operations are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state, tribal and local authorities and agencies. For example, certain states such as North Dakota and Montana require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Such states may also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the sourcing and disposal of water used in the process of drilling, completion and abandonment, the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells, and the regulation of spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that producers can produce from their wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which they can drill. Moreover, both states impose a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within their jurisdictions. Failure to comply with any such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry will most likely increase our cost of doing business and may affect our profitability. Because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws in the areas in which we operate. Significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective. 
 Regulation of Transportation of Oil
Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Future sales of crude oil will be affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil by common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate and access regulation. The FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate oil pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market-based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. Effective January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system (based on inflation) for transportation rates for oil pipelines that allows a pipeline to increase its rates annually up to a prescribed ceiling, without making a cost of service filing. Every five years, the FERC reviews the appropriateness of the index level in relation to changes in industry costs. On December 17, 2015, the FERC established a new price index for the five-year period which commenced on July 1, 2016. 
 Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated. 
 Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is generally governed by pro-rationing provisions set forth in the pipelines published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us once we commence revenues to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors. 
 Regulation of Transportation and Sales of Natural Gas
Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) and regulations issued under those statutes. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.

Onshore gathering services, which occur upstream of FERC jurisdictional transmission services, are regulated by the states. Although the FERC has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a non-jurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function, the FERCs determinations as to the classification of facilities is done on a case-by-case basis. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future. 
 Intrastate natural gas transportation and facilities are also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies, and certain transportation services provided by intrastate pipelines are also regulated by FERC. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Our operations and properties are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment, and relating to safety and health. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation generally is toward stricter standards, and this trend will likely continue. These laws and regulations may: 
      require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities; 
     limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness and other protected areas; and 
     impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from its operations. 
 The permits required for our operations may be subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce their regulations, and violations are subject to fines or injunctions, or both. Given our limited operations to date, management believes that we are in compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations, and have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in interpretations thereof could have a significant impact on our company, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. 
 The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and comparable state statutes impose strict, joint and several liability on owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites. It is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from its definition of hazardous substance, state laws affecting our operations may impose clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum related products. In addition, although RCRA classifies certain oil field wastes as non-hazardous, such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes thereby making such wastes subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements. Recent regulation and litigation that has been brought against others in the industry under RCRA concern liability for earthquakes that were allegedly caused by injection of oil field wastes.

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) seeks to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animal, fish and plant species, nor destroy or modify the critical habitat of such species. Under ESA, exploration and production operations, as well as actions by federal agencies, may not significantly impair or jeopardize the species or its habitat. ESA provides for criminal penalties for willful violations of ESA. Other statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and that may apply to our operations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. Given our limited operations to date, management believes that we are in compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations, although any change in these statutes or any reclassification of a species as endangered could subject our company (directly or indirectly through our operating partners) to significant expenses to modify our operations or could force discontinuation of certain operations altogether. 
 On April 17, 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) finalized rules proposed on July 28, 2011 that establish new air emission controls under the Clean Air Act (CCA) for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, the EPAs rule package includes New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for the oil and natural gas source category to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. On August 5, 2013, the EPA issued final updates to its 2012 VOC performance standards for storage tanks. The rules establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. In addition, the rules revise leak detection requirements for natural gas processing plants. These rules may require a number of modifications to the operations of our third-party operating partners, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from compressors. 
 On September 18, 2015, the EPA proposed to further amend the NSPS for the oil and natural gas source category to set standards for methane and VOC emissions from new and modified oil and gas production sources and natural gas-processing and transmission sources. These regulations were finalized and published in the Federal Register on June 3, 2016. Although we cannot predict the cost to comply with these new requirements at this point, compliance with these new rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business. 
 These new regulations and proposals and any other new regulations requiring the installation of more sophisticated pollution control equipment could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, or the Clean Water Act (the CWA), imposes restrictions and controls on the discharge of produced waters and other pollutants into navigable waters. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. The CWA and certain state regulations prohibit the discharge of produced water, sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings, sediment and certain other substances related to the oil and gas industry into certain coastal and offshore waters without an individual or general National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System discharge permit. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater and/or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans. The CWA and comparable state statutes provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of oil and other pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges, for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release. 
 The underground injection of oil and natural gas wastes are regulated by the Underground Injection Control program authorized by the Safe Drinking Water Act. The primary objective of injection well operating requirements is to ensure the mechanical integrity of the injection apparatus and to prevent migration of fluids from the injection zone into underground sources of drinking water. Substantially all of the oil and natural gas production in which we have interest is developed from unconventional sources that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate gas production. Legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of underground injection and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, were proposed in recent sessions of Congress. The U.S. Congress continues to consider legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to address hydraulic fracturing operations.

Scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways. The federal government is currently undertaking several studies of hydraulic fracturings potential impacts. Several states, including Montana and North Dakota, have also proposed or adopted legislative or regulatory restrictions on hydraulic fracturing. A number of municipalities in other states, including Colorado and Texas, have enacted bans on hydraulic fracturing. New York States ban on hydraulic fracturing was recently upheld by the Courts. In Colorado, the Colorado Supreme Court has ruled the municipal bans were preempted by state law. We cannot predict whether any other legislation will ever be enacted and if so, what its provisions would be. If additional levels of regulation and permits were required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level, which could lead to delays, increased operating costs and process prohibitions that would materially adversely affect our potential for revenue and results of operations. 
 The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) establishes a national environmental policy and goals for the protection, maintenance and enhancement of the environment and provides a process for implementing these goals within federal agencies. A major federal agency action having the potential to significantly impact the environment requires review under NEPA. Many of the activities of our third-party operating partners are covered under categorical exclusions which results in a shorter NEPA review process. The Council on Environmental Quality has announced an intention to reinvigorate NEPA reviews and on March 12, 2012, issued final guidance that may result in longer review processes that could lead to delays and increased costs that could materially adversely affect our potential for revenues and results of operations. 
 Climate Change 
 Significant studies and research have been devoted to climate change, and climate change has developed into a major political issue in the United States and globally. Certain research suggests that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change and pose a threat to the environment. Recent scientific research and political debate has focused in part on carbon dioxide and methane incidental to oil and natural gas exploration and production. 
 In the United States, legislative and regulatory initiatives are underway to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would control GHG emissions through a cap and trade program and several states have already implemented programs to reduce GHG emissions. The U.S. Supreme Court determined that GHG emissions fall within the federal Clean Air Act, or the CAA, definition of an air pollutant. In response, the EPA promulgated an endangerment finding paving the way for regulation of GHG emissions under the CAA. In 2010, the EPA issued a final rule, known as the Tailoring Rule, that makes certain large stationary sources and modification projects subject to permitting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. On June 23, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA held that the EPAs Tailoring Rule was invalid, but held that if a source was subject to Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) or Title V based on emissions of conventional pollutants like sulfur dioxide, particulates, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone or lead, then the EPA could also require the source to control GHG emissions and the source would have to install Best Available Control Technology to do so. As a result, a source no longer is required to meet PSD and Title V permitting requirements based solely on its GHG emissions, but may still have to control GHG emissions if it is an otherwise regulated source. 
 On February 23, 2014, Colorado became the first state in the nation to adopt rules to control methane emissions from oil and gas facilities. On June 3, 2016, EPA issued three final rules that were intended to curb emissions of methane, VOCs and toxic air pollutants such as benzene from new, reconstructed and modified oil and gas sources. These new regulations include leak detection and repair provisions, and may require controls to reduce methane emissions from certain oil and gas facilities. To the extent our third party operating partners are required to further control methane emissions, such controls could impact our business. 
 15

In addition, in September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of GHGs from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States beginning in 2011 for emissions in 2010. On November 30, 2010, the EPA published a final rule expanding its existing GHG emissions reporting to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas systems beginning in 2012. Our third party operating partners are required to report their greenhouse gas emissions under these rules. Because regulation of GHG emissions is relatively new, further regulatory, legislative and judicial developments are likely to occur. Such developments may affect how these GHG initiatives will impact us. Moreover, while the U.S. Supreme Court held in its June 2011 decision American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut that, with respect to claims concerning GHG emissions, the federal common law of nuisance was displaced by the federal Clean Air Act, the Court left open the question of whether tort claims against sources of GHG emissions alleging property damage may proceed under state common law. There thus remains some litigation risk for such claims. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulation of and other risks associated with GHG emissions, we cannot predict the financial impact of related developments on us. 
 Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. To the extent that our products are competing with higher greenhouse gas emitting energy sources, our products would become more desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. To the extent that our products are competing with lower GHG emitting energy sources such as solar and wind, our products would become less desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations. 
 The majority of scientific studies on climate change suggest that stronger storms may occur in the future in the areas where we operate, although the scientific studies are not unanimous. Although operators may take steps to mitigate physical risks from storms, no assurance can be given that future storms will not have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Subsidiaries 
 We have two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Alta Disposal Ltd. (Alta Disposal) and Black Box Energy, Inc. (Black Box Energy), and a 51% owned subsidiary, Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd. (ADM). Alta Disposal was incorporated in the province of Alberta, Canada on July 8, 2011. This subsidiary was formed to stake MAIM (Metallic and Industrial Mineral) rights in Alberta which subsequently lapsed or were sold. Black Box Energy was incorporated on September 9, 2016 in the State of Nevada for the purposes of acquiring a 50% working interest in the McKean County Project. ADM (formerly Blue Tap Resources, Inc.) is an Alberta, Canada corporation. On September 4, 2015, we sold substantially all of the assets, business and undertaking of ADM. 
Employees 
 As of June 30, 2017, we had 2 full-time employees. We intend to hire additional staff and to engage consultants in general administration on an as-needed basis. We also may engage experts in general business to advise us in various capacities.
