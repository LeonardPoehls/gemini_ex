Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 
Seattle Genetics is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer. Our marketed product ADCETRIS®, or brentuximab vedotin, is now approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Commission for three indications, encompassing several settings for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or sALCL. ADCETRIS is commercially available in 66 countries around the world, including in the United States, Canada, members of the European Union and Japan. We are collaborating with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS on a global basis. Under this collaboration, Seattle Genetics retains commercial rights for ADCETRIS in the United States and its territories and in Canada, and Takeda has commercial rights in the rest of the world. 
 
Beyond our current labeled indications, we and Takeda have a broad development strategy for ADCETRIS evaluating its therapeutic potential in earlier lines of therapy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma or mature T-cell lymphoma, or MTCL, also known as peripheral T-Cell lymphoma, or PTCL, including sALCL, and in other CD30-expressing malignancies. We and Takeda are currently conducting three phase 3 clinical trials of ADCETRIS: ALCANZA, ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2. All of these trials are being conducted under Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, agreements with the FDA and pursuant to scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. An SPA is an agreement with the FDA regarding the design of the clinical trial, including size and clinical endpoints, to support an efficacy claim in a new drug application or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, submission to the FDA if the trial achieves its primary endpoints. We plan to submit a supplemental Biologics License Application, or sBLA, to the FDA in mid-2017 to seek approval for a new indication in CD30-expressing relapsed CTCL. We have also completed enrollment of 1,334 patients in our ECHELON-1 trial and expect to report data in 2017. In November 2016, we completed enrollment of 452 patients in our ECHELON-2 trial, and expect to report data in 2018. 
 
We are also advancing the development of SGN-CD33A, or vadastuximab talirine. A phase 3 clinical trial, called the CASCADE trial, was initiated in the second quarter of 2016 based on data from our phase 1 clinical trial for patients with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. The CASCADE trial is evaluating SGN-CD33A in 
 
1 
 
 combination with hypomethylating agents, or HMAs, in previously untreated older patients with AML who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy. We also have been evaluating SGN-CD33A in additional treatment settings, and overall, more than 300 patients have been treated with SGN-CD33A to date in clinical trials across these multiple treatment settings. On December 27, 2016, we announced that we had received notice from the FDA that a full clinical hold or partial clinical hold had been placed on several early stage trials of SGN-CD33A in AML to evaluate the potential risk of hepatotoxicity following adverse medical events, including fatal events. We are working diligently with the FDA to determine whether there is any association between hepatotoxicity and treatment with SGN-CD33A and to promptly identify appropriate measures for patient safety with the goal of addressing the FDAs concerns. 
 
In addition, in collaboration with Astellas Pharma, Inc., or Astellas, we are developing ASG-22ME, or enfortumab vedotin. We and Astellas are planning discussions with regulatory agencies during 2017 to advance the program into potential registrational trials in urothelial cancer patients, including patients who have been previously treated with a checkpoint inhibitor therapy. 
 
Our clinical-stage pipeline also includes six other antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, programs consisting of SGN-LIV1A, SGN-CD19A, or denintuzumab mafodotin, SGN-CD19B, SGN-CD123A, SGN-CD352A, and ASG-15ME, as well as two immuno-oncology agents, SEA-CD40, which is based on our sugar-engineered antibody, or SEA, technology, and SGN-2FF, which is a novel small molecule. In addition, we have multiple preclinical and research-stage programs that employ our proprietary technologies, including SGN-CD48A, a preclinical ADC that is a candidate for investigational new drug, or IND, submission in 2017. 
 
We announced on February 10, 2017 that we had entered into a development and license agreement, or the Immunomedics License, with Immunomedics, Inc., or Immunomedics, pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Immunomedics License, we would receive exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize sacituzumab govitecan, or IMMU-132. IMMU-132 is an ADC targeted to TROP-2, which is expressed in several solid tumors, and is in a pivotal phase 1/2 trial for patients with triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC, and is being investigated in other solid tumors. IMMU-132 received Breakthrough Therapy Designation, or BTD, from the FDA for the treatment of patients with TNBC who have failed prior therapies for metastatic disease. In connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License, Immunomedics would receive an upfront payment of $250 million. In addition, Immunomedics would also be eligible to receive development, regulatory and sales-dependent milestone payments across multiple indications and geographical regions of up to a total maximum of approximately $1.7 billion, as well as royalties which are based on a percentage of annual net sales of the licensed products, if any, beginning in the teens and rising to twenty percent based on sales volume. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, or the HSR Act, there being no pending court or administrative challenges to the Immunomedics License and there being no court or administrative orders blocking the closing. On February 20, 2017, Immunomedics and we entered into a letter agreement pursuant to which Immunomedics irrevocably waived to the extent applicable to Immunomedics the condition precedent to the closing and effectiveness of the Immunomedics License that there be no pending court or administrative challenges to the transaction. Additionally, under the terms of the Immunomedics License, Immunomedics had the right to continue discussions with a small number of parties that previously expressed interest in licensing IMMU-132 until 11:59 p.m. New York City time on February 19, 2017. If a third party had provided Immunomedics with a financially superior licensing offer, we would have had the right to match any such offer, and if we had decided not to match, Immunomedics would have had the right to accept the superior offer and terminate the Immunomedics License upon payment of a termination fee to us. We have not received notice from Immunomedics of any such third party offers during this limited time period, and on February 21, 2017, Immunomedics announced that it is subject to customary no-shop restrictions on its and its representatives ability to solicit, discuss or negotiate alternative licensing agreement proposals from third parties with regard to IMMU-132.

On February 13, 2017, we were named a co-defendant in a lawsuit filed by venBio Select Advisors LLC, or venBio, in the Delaware Chancery Court against the members of the board of directors of Immunomedics pursuant to which, among other things, venBio seeks to enjoin the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License. As a result of the pending litigation challenging the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License, Immunomedics and we have committed to the Court not to close the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License prior to March 10, 2017. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of this lawsuit or the impact it may have on the Immunomedics License or the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License. See License AgreementsImmunomedics License below for more information. 
 
We have collaborations for our ADC technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd., or AbbVie; Bayer Pharma AG, or Bayer; Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., or Celldex; Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, or Genentech; GlaxoSmithKline LLC, or GSK; Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer; and PSMA Development Company LLC, a subsidiary of Progenics Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Progenics. In addition, we have entered into a 50/50 co-development agreement with Agensys, Inc., an affiliate of Astellas, for the development of ADCs, including ASG-22ME. We also have an option for an ADC co-development agreement with Genmab A/S, or Genmab, and a collaboration with Unum Therapeutics, Inc., or Unum, to develop and commercialize novel antibody-coupled T-cell receptor, or ACTR, therapies incorporating our antibodies for the treatment of cancer. 
 
Our Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) Technologies 
 
ADCETRIS and many product candidates in our pipeline of clinical-stage monoclonal antibody-based product candidates utilize our ADC technology. ADCs are monoclonal antibodies that are linked to cytotoxic or cell-killing agents. Our ADCs utilize monoclonal antibodies that internalize within target cells after binding to a specified cell-surface receptor. Enzymes present inside the cell catalyze the release of the cytotoxic agent from the monoclonal antibody, which then results in the desired activity, specific killing of the target cell. 
 
A key component of our ADCs are the linkers that attach the cell-killing agent to the monoclonal antibody, which are designed to hold the cytotoxic agent to the monoclonal antibody until it binds to the cell surface receptor on the target cell and then to release the cytotoxic agent upon internalization within the target cell. This targeted delivery of the cell-killing agent is intended to maximize delivery of the cytotoxic agent to targeted cells while minimizing toxicity to normal tissues. Our ADCs use proprietary auristatins, which are microtubule disrupting agents, or pyrrolobenzodiazepine, or PBD, dimers, which are DNA cross-linkers, as cell-killing agents. The PBD dimer cell-killing agent is stably linked to an antibody using our proprietary, site-specific conjugation technology, resulting in uniform drug-loading of two PBD dimers per antibody. We call this engineered antibody an EC-mAb. In contrast to natural products that are often more difficult to produce and link to antibodies, the cytotoxic drugs used in our ADCs are synthetically produced and easier to scale for manufacturing. ADCETRIS, SGN-CD33A (vadastuximab talirine), ASG-22ME (enfortumab vedotin), SGN-LIV1A, SGN-CD19A (denintuzumab mafodotin), SGN-CD19B, SGN-CD123A, SGN-CD352A, and ASG-15ME, each utilize our proprietary, auristatin-based or PBD-based ADC technologies. These technologies are also the basis of our corporate collaborations. In addition, we are advancing a preclinical product candidate, SGN-CD48A, which utilizes a novel linker technology, PEG-Glucuronide linker, attached to an auristatin. We own or hold exclusive or partially-exclusive licenses to multiple issued patents and patent applications covering our ADC technology. We continue to evaluate new linkers, antibody formats, and cell-killing agents for use in our ADC programs. 
 
Our Sugar-Engineered Antibody (SEA) Technology 
 
Our proprietary SEA technology is a method to selectively reduce fucose incorporation in monoclonal antibodies as they are produced in cell line-based manufacturing. We believe that this may result in increased effector function and antitumor activity. Our SEA technology is a novel approach to modify the activity of monoclonal antibodies that is complementary to our ADC technology. 
 
3 
 
A key feature of our SEA technology is that no genetic modification of the antibody-producing cell line is necessary and standard cell culture conditions can be used while maintaining the underlying manufacturing processes, yields and product quality. We believe the SEA approach may be simpler and more cost-effective to implement as compared to existing technologies for enhancing antibody effector function, most of which require development of new cell lines. 
 
SEA-CD40 is a clinical-stage non-fucosylated monoclonal antibody developed using SEA technology. Enhanced binding to effector cells results in crosslinking and activation of CD40 signaling in immune cells. We hypothesize that this increased stimulation of the patients own immune cells may result in meaningful antitumor activity. We are developing SEA-CD40 as a novel immuno-oncology agent. A phase 1 clinical trial of SEA-CD40 for solid tumors and hematologic malignancies is ongoing. 
 
Other Technologies 
 
In addition, we utilize other technologies designed to maximize antitumor activity and reduce toxicity of antibody-based therapies. Genetic engineering enables us to produce antibodies that are optimized for their intended uses. For ADCs, we screen and select antibodies that bind to antigens that are differentially expressed on tumor cells versus vital normal tissues, rapidly internalized within target cells and utilize native or engineered conjugation sites to optimize drug attachment. In some cases, we evaluate the use of our monoclonal antibodies and ADCs in combination with conventional chemotherapy and other anticancer agents, which may result in increased antitumor activity. 
Our Strategy 
 
Our strategy is to become a leading developer and marketer of targeted therapies for cancer. Key elements of our strategy are to: 
 

 | Successfully Execute our ADCETRIS Commercial Plan. An important near-term objective is to continue to execute our ADCETRIS commercial plan by driving market penetration and duration of therapy consistent with the current ADCETRIS label. We continue to focus our efforts on commercializing ADCETRIS in the United States and Canada through the coordinated efforts of our sales, marketing, reimbursement and market planning groups. In addition, as of January 31, 2017, ADCETRIS had received marketing authorizations in relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and sALCL from regulatory authorities in 66 countries, and we are continuing to support Takedas efforts to obtain regulatory approvals and conduct commercial launches in additional countries worldwide. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expand the Therapeutic Potential of ADCETRIS. We believe ADCETRIS may have applications in earlier lines of therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma and MTCL and in other types of CD30-expressing lymphomas. In this regard, during 2016 we reported data from the ALCANZA trial and intend to submit an sBLA to the FDA in mid-2017 to seek approval for a new indication in CD30-expressing relapsed CTCL. We also have ongoing clinical trials evaluating ADCETRIS in frontline therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma (the ECHELON-1 trial) and MTCL (the ECHELON-2 trial). Clinical trials are also being conducted by us, by our collaborators and as investigator sponsored trials in different CD30-expressing indications, including salvage therapy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma prior to autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or auto-HSCT, novel combinations of ADCETRIS plus immuno-oncology or other anticancer agents and in other areas of medical and scientific interest.

hold or partial clinical hold had been placed on several early stage trials of SGN-CD33A in AML to evaluate the potential risk of hepatotoxicity following adverse medical events, including fatal events. We are working diligently with the FDA to determine whether there is any association between hepatotoxicity and treatment with SGN-CD33A, and to promptly identify appropriate measures for patient safety with the goal of addressing the FDAs concerns. No new studies of SGN-CD33A will be initiated unless and until the clinical holds are lifted. Our phase 3 CASCADE trial in older AML patients and our phase 1/2 trial in myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, are currently proceeding with enrollment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Advance ASG-22ME into Registrational Trials for Urothelial Cancer. We and Astellas are planning discussions with regulatory agencies during 2017 to advance the program into potential registrational trials of ASG-22ME in urothelial cancer patients, including patients who have been previously treated with a checkpoint inhibitor therapy. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Global Expansion. We have established operations in Zug, Switzerland to support clinical trials, regulatory, medical affairs and manufacturing and future potential commercial activities for our pipeline. In 2017, we will continue to develop our European presence in support of our global expansion. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continue to Develop our Other Pipeline Programs. We believe that it is important to maintain a diverse pipeline of product candidates to sustain our future growth. To accomplish this, we are continuing to advance the development of our other clinical product candidates, including SGN-LIV1A, SGN-CD19A, SEA-CD40, SGN-CD19B, SGN-CD123A, SGN-CD352A, SGN-2FF and ASG-15ME, as well as other preclinical and research-stage programs that employ our proprietary technologies. In addition, we have an ADC co-development agreement with Genmab that provides us with a future ADC product opportunity and we are co-developing several preclinical immuno-oncology programs with Unum Therapeutics. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continue to Leverage our Industry-Leading ADC Technology. We have developed proprietary ADC technology designed to empower monoclonal antibodies. We are currently developing multiple product candidates that employ our ADC technology and we have also licensed this technology to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to generate collaboration revenues and funding, as well as potential milestones and potential future royalties. Presently, we have active ADC collaborations with AbbVie, Bayer, Celldex, Genentech, GSK, Pfizer, and Progenics, as well as ADC co-development agreements with Astellas and Genmab. These ADC collaboration and co-development agreements have generated over $350 million as of December 31, 2016 through a combination of upfront payments, research support, and other fees, milestone payments and equity purchases.

 | Support Future Growth of our Pipeline through Internal Research Efforts and Strategic In-Licensing. We have internal research programs directed toward identifying novel antigen targets, monoclonal antibodies and other targeting molecules, creating new antibody engineering techniques and developing new classes of stable linkers and cell-killing agents for our ADC technology. In addition, we supplement these internal efforts through ongoing initiatives to identify product candidates, products and technologies to in-license from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. In this regard, we recently announced our entry into the Immunomedics License, pursuant to which, if the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License are consummated, we would receive exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize IMMU-132. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Enter into Strategic Product Collaborations to Supplement our Internal Resources. We enter into collaborations to broaden and accelerate clinical trial development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. Collaborations can generate significant capital, supplement our own internal expertise in key areas such as manufacturing, regulatory affairs and clinical development, and provide us with access to our collaborators marketing, sales and distribution capabilities in specific territories. When establishing strategic collaborations, we seek beneficial financial terms and endeavor to retain significant product rights, particularly in the United States, Canada and Europe.

ADCETRIS 
 
ADCETRIS is an ADC comprised of an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody attached by a protease-cleavable linker to a proprietary microtubule disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E, or MMAE. ADCETRIS employs a linker system that is designed to be stable in the bloodstream and to release MMAE upon internalization into CD30-expressing cells. We believe that the CD30 antigen is an attractive target for cancer therapy because it is expressed on multiple types of cancer, but has limited expression on normal tissues. We are collaborating with Takeda on the global development and commercialization of ADCETRIS. Under this collaboration, we retain commercial rights in the United States and Canada. Takeda has exclusive rights to commercialize ADCETRIS in the rest of the world. ADCETRIS has received regulatory approvals as follows: 

 | United States. ADCETRIS® (brentuximab vedotin) injection for intravenous infusion has received approval from the FDA for three indications: (1) regular approval for the treatment of patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of auto-HSCT or after failure of at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not auto-HSCT candidates, (2) regular approval for the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma patients at high risk of relapse or progression as post-auto-HSCT consolidation, and (3) accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with sALCL after failure of at least one prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen. The sALCL indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for the sALCL indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Canada. Health Canada has issued a Notice of Compliance with conditions, authorizing marketing of ADCETRIS for two lymphoma indications: (1) the treatment of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of ASCT, or after failure of at least two multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not ASCT candidates, and (2) the treatment of patients with sALCL after failure of at least one multi-agent chemotherapy regimen. The indications for ADCETRIS were authorized based on promising response rates demonstrated in single-arm trials. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | European Union. ADCETRIS was granted conditional marketing authorization by the European Commission in October 2012 for two indications: (1) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma following ASCT, or following at least two prior therapies when ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy is not a treatment option, and (2) the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory sALCL. The European Commission extended the current conditional approval of ADCETRIS and approved ADCETRIS for the treatment of adult patients with CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma at increased risk of relapse or progression following ASCT. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Worldwide. As of January 31, 2017, ADCETRIS is commercially available in 66 countries for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed or refractory sALCL. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required ADCETRIS Post-approval Clinical Study 
 
ADCETRIS was granted approval for the treatment of patients with sALCL after failure of at least one prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen under the FDAs accelerated approval regulations, which allows the FDA to approve products for cancer or other serious or life-threatening illnesses based on surrogate endpoints or on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. Under the FDAs accelerated approval regulations, we are subject to certain post-approval requirements pursuant to which we are conducting an additional confirmatory phase 3 trial to verify and describe the clinical benefit of ADCETRIS. In addition, we are subject to extensive ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review from the FDA and other applicable regulatory agencies, such as continued adverse event reporting requirements and the requirement to have our promotional materials pre-cleared by the FDA. 
 
Successful completion of our AETHERA trial converted our accelerated approval to regular approval in the relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma indication. ECHELON-2 is a required post-approval study to convert the approval of ADCETRIS in the United States from accelerated approval to regular approval in its currently approved relapsed sALCL indication; however, the FDA has indicated that positive results from either the ECHELON-1 or 
 
9 
 
 the ECHELON-2 trial could form the basis for such a conversion. Post-approval clinical studies similar to those required by the FDA are required in many other countries, including in Canada and the European Union. The requirements of these post-approval clinical studies vary from country to country and may in some cases involve testing in addition to the post-approval studies required by the FDA. 
 
Market Opportunities 
 
According to the American Cancer Society, more than 8,500 cases of Hodgkin lymphoma were expected to be diagnosed in the United States during 2016, and an estimated 1,120 people were expected to die of the disease. Approximately 1,800 additional patients per year in the United States are diagnosed with sALCL, a type of MTCL that expresses the CD30 antigen. The use of combination chemotherapy as frontline therapy for malignant lymphomas has resulted in high remission rates; however, these frontline chemotherapy regimens have substantial associated toxicities and a significant number of lymphoma patients relapse and require additional treatments including other chemotherapy regimens and ASCT. For the reasons discussed in Item 1ARisk Factors, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals to market ADCETRIS for frontline Hodgkin lymphoma or MTCL, or otherwise continue to expand its labeled indications of use. 
Clinical Development Status and Plan 
 
In collaboration with Takeda, we are pursuing a broad development strategy that includes clinical trials of ADCETRIS both as a single agent and in combination with standard therapies for CD30-expressing cancers. These ongoing clinical trials include: 
 
Phase 3 Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (ALCANZA).    The ALCANZA trial is a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial of ADCETRIS versus investigators choice of methotrexate or bexarotene in patients with CD30-expressing CTCL, including those with pcALCL or mycosis fungoides. The ALCANZA trial enrolled 131 patients and is being conducted under an SPA agreement with the FDA and also received EMA scientific advice. In August 2016, we reported that the ALCANZA phase 3 trial met its primary endpoint and showed that treatment with ADCETRIS resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the rate of objective response lasting at least four months (ORR4) versus the control arm as assessed by an independent review committee (p-value <0.0001). Additional data were reported at the December 2016 American Society of Hematology, or ASH, annual meeting showing that the median progression free survival, or PFS, in the ADCETRIS arm was 16.7 months compared to 3.5 months in the control arm (p-value <0.0001). The most common adverse events of any grade occurring in 15 percent or more of patients in the ADCETRIS and control arms were peripheral neuropathy (67 and six percent, respectively), nausea (36 and 13 percent, respectively), diarrhea (29 and six percent, respectively), fatigue (29 and 27 percent, respectively), vomiting (17 and five percent, respectively), alopecia (15 and three percent, respectively), pruritis (17 and 13 percent respectively), fever (17 and 18 percent, respectively), decreased appetite (15 and five percent, respectively) and hypertriglyceridemia (2 and 18 percent, respectively). We plan to submit a sBLA to the FDA in mid-2017 to seek approval for a new indication in CD30-expressing relapsed CTCL. ADCETRIS is included in National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, treatment guidelines for patients with certain types of CTCL. 
 
Phase 3 Frontline Hodgkin Lymphoma (ECHELON-1).    We and Takeda have completed patient enrollment of 1,334 patients in a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial investigating ADCETRIS plus AVD versus ABVD as frontline therapy in patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma, or the ECHELON-1 trial. The study enrolled patients who have histologically-confirmed diagnosis of Stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma and who have not been previously treated with systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The primary endpoint of this trial is modified PFS per independent review facility assessment. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, complete remission rate and safety. The trial is being conducted under an SPA agreement with the FDA and also received scientific advice from the EMA. We expect to report data from this trial in 2017. 
 
Data from a phase 1 trial in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma that evaluated ADCETRIS combined with ABVD or combined with AVD supported our decision to initiate the ECHELON-1 phase 3 trial. In November 2013, data 
 
10 
 
 from the phase 1 trial were published in the medical publication Lancet Oncology. Among the 25 evaluable patients in the ADCETRIS plus AVD cohorts, 24 patients who completed frontline therapy on study achieved a complete remission. Follow-up data were reported at the December 2014 ASH annual meeting showing that in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm, three-year overall survival was 100 percent and three-year failure-free survival was 92 percent. In the ADCETRIS plus ABVD arm, three-year overall survival was 92 percent and three-year failure-free survival was 79 percent. Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurring in more than one patient overall noted in the ABVD and AVD cohorts, respectively, were neutropenia (80 percent, 77 percent), anemia (20 percent, 12 percent), febrile neutropenia (20 percent, 8 percent) and pulmonary toxicity (24 percent, 0 percent). 
 
Phase 3 Frontline Mature T-Cell Lymphoma (ECHELON-2).    We and Takeda have completed patient enrollment of 452 patients in a global randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center phase 3 clinical trial known as ECHELON-2. This trial is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with CHP versus CHOP for the treatment of newly diagnosed CD30-expressing MTCL patients, including patients with sALCL and other types of peripheral T-cell lymphomas. The primary endpoint of the trial is PFS per independent review facility assessment. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, complete remission rate and safety. We expect to report data in 2018. A molecular companion diagnostic test is being used in this trial to identify eligible patients based on CD30-expression. We are developing a companion diagnostic under a collaboration agreement with Ventana Medical Systems, or Ventana, and Takeda. The ECHELON-2 trial is being conducted under an SPA agreement with the FDA and also received scientific advice from the EMA. We are required to conduct this trial as part of our ADCETRIS post-marketing requirement for the relapsed sALCL indication, and the trial is designed to be confirmatory in the United States, Canada and Europe. 
 
Data from a phase 1 trial that evaluated ADCETRIS plus chemotherapy for frontline sALCL, which was subsequently amended to include patients with any CD30-expressing MTCL, supported our decision to initiate the ECHELON-2 trial. Among the 26 patients who received the combination regimen of ADCETRIS plus CHP, 88 percent achieved a complete remission. At the December 2016 ASH annual meeting, follow-up data were reported showing that the estimated four-year PFS rate was 52 percent, with no patients receiving a consolidative stem cell transplant in first remission. The estimated four-year overall survival rate was 80 percent. There were no progression events or deaths in the trial since the previous presentation at the 2015 ASH annual meeting. The most common adverse events of any grade occurring in more than 30 percent of patients were nausea and peripheral sensory neuropathy (69 percent each), diarrhea (62 percent), fatigue (58 percent) and hair loss (54 percent). ADCETRIS is included in NCCN treatment guidelines for patients with relapsed CD30-expressing PTCL. 
 
Frontline Therapy for Hodgkin Lymphoma Patients Age 60 and Over.    In October 2012, we initiated a phase 2 clinical trial evaluating ADCETRIS monotherapy as a frontline therapy for patients age 60 or older with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma. The trial was subsequently amended to include the administration of ADCETRIS in combination with bendamustine or dacarbazine. The phase 2 open-label clinical trial is evaluating the activity and tolerability of ADCETRIS in patients age 60 or older with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma. The primary endpoint of the trial is the objective response rate, with key secondary endpoints of safety and tolerability, duration of response, complete remission rate and PFS. At the October 2016 International Symposium on Hodgkin Lymphoma, or ISHL, meeting, we presented updated data from this study. Of 21 evaluable patients in the dacarbazine combination arm, all patients (100 percent) had an objective response, including 62 percent with a complete remission. Of 17 evaluable patients in the bendamustine combination arm, all patients (100 percent) had an objective response, including 88 percent with a complete remission. The most common adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 25 percent of patients in the dacarbazine combination arm were peripheral sensory neuropathy (77 percent); constipation (45 percent); fatigue and nausea (41 percent each), peripheral edema (32 percent) and diarrhea (27 percent). The most common adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 25 percent of patients in the bendamustine combination arm were diarrhea (85 percent), nausea (65 percent), fatigue (50 percent), decreased appetite (45 percent) and peripheral sensory neuropathy and fever (40 percent each). Enrollment on the bendamustine arm was closed given the tolerability of the combination did not meet study goals for this fragile patient population. In 2016, the trial was amended to 
 
11 
 
 evaluate the combination of ADCETRIS and nivolumab. ADCETRIS monotherapy is included in NCCN guidelines for older patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma. 
 
Relapsed or Refractory CD30-expressing DLBCL.    In October 2015, we announced the initiation of a randomized phase 2 open-label, multi-center clinical trial of rituximab and bendamustine with or without ADCETRIS in relapsed or refractory patients with CD30-expressing DLBCL. The primary endpoint is to compare the objective response rates between the two study arms. Secondary endpoints include PFS, complete remission rate, duration of response and overall survival. ADCETRIS is included in NCCN guidelines for patients with second-line or beyond CD30-expressing DLBCL. 
 
Combination trials with nivolumab (OPDIVO).    In January 2015, we and BMS announced a clinical trial collaboration agreement to evaluate the investigational combination of ADCETRIS and BMS immunotherapy nivolumab in two phase 1/2 clinical trials. Nivolumab is a programmed death-1, or PD-1, immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to harness the bodys own immune system to help restore antitumor immune response. 
 
One ongoing trial is evaluating the combination of ADCETRIS and nivolumab for patients with second line Hodgkin lymphoma. At the 2016 ASH annual meeting, data were reported from 42 patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of frontline therapy who received the combination regimen. Patients were treated with up to four cycles of combination therapy. After completion of the fourth cycle of treatment, patients were eligible to undergo an ASCT. Of 29 response-evaluable patients, 90 percent had an objective response, including 62 percent with a complete metabolic response. The most common adverse events of any grade occurring prior to ASCT in more than 20 percent of patients were fatigue, nausea, infusion related reaction, or IRR, pruritus and rash. IRRs were observed in 38 percent of patients and most symptoms included flushing and nausea (14 percent each); chest discomfort, dyspnea, urticaria (12 percent each); cough and pruritis (10 percent each). The protocol was amended to require premedication with low-dose corticosteroids and antihistamine. 
 
The second ongoing trial is evaluating the combination of ADCETRIS and nivolumab in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including DLBCL. This trial has been subsequently amended to evaluate the combination in rare B-cell lymphomas, including gray zone and mediastinal B-cell lymphomas. 
 
Investigator-Sponsored Trials.    In addition to our corporate-sponsored trials, as of December 31, 2016, there were more than 35 reported investigator-sponsored trials of ADCETRIS in the United States. In addition, we and Takeda are reviewing proposals from multiple clinical investigators and cooperative groups in the United States, Canada and Europe about potential investigator-sponsored trials of ADCETRIS. The investigator-sponsored trials to date include the use of ADCETRIS in a number of malignant hematologic indications such as CTCL, DLBCL, untreated limited stage Hodgkin lymphoma, salvage therapy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma prior to auto-HSCT and graft versus host disease. There are also numerous other investigator-sponsored trials for the use of ADCETRIS in other CD30-expressing and select CD30-undetectable settings, and in solid tumors such as mesothelioma and testicular germ cell tumors. One cooperative group investigator-sponsored trial is currently evaluating ADCETRIS with immuno-oncology compounds in Hodgkin lymphoma, and we expect additional investigator-sponsored trials might evaluate ADCETRIS in novel combination regimens. 
 
SGN-CD33A (Vadastuximab Talirine) 
 
SGN-CD33A is an ADC composed of an anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody linked to a potent PBD dimer using our proprietary ADC technology. We are developing this product candidate as a potential treatment of AML and MDS. SGN-CD33A targets CD33, a protein that is expressed on most AML cells. SGN-CD33A employs our newest proprietary ADC technology. This technology is comprised of a PBD dimer, which is a potent cell-killing agent that works by a different mechanism than auristatins, linked to an engineered antibody called EC-mAb, resulting in uniform drug-loading of two PBD dimers per antibody.

On December 27, 2016, we announced that we had received notice from the FDA that a full clinical hold or partial clinical hold had been placed on several early stage trials of SGN-CD33A in AML to evaluate the potential risk of hepatotoxicity following adverse medical events, including fatal events. Our phase 1/2 trial of SGN-CD33A monotherapy in pre- and post- allogeneic transplant AML patients has been placed on full clinical hold. Additionally, clinical trials evaluating SGN-CD33A monotherapy, and including a subset of older AML patients in combination with HMAs, and SGN-CD33A combination treatment with 7+3 chemotherapy in newly diagnosed younger AML patients have been placed on partial clinical hold. Our phase 3 CASCADE trial in older AML patients and our phase 1/2 trial in MDS are proceeding with enrollment. No new studies of SGN-CD33A will be initiated unless and until the clinical holds are lifted. We are working diligently with the FDA to determine whether there is any association between hepatotoxicity and treatment with SGN-CD33A and to promptly identify appropriate measures for patient safety with the goal of addressing the FDAs concerns. 
 
In May 2016, we initiated a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global clinical trial called CASCADE. The CASCADE trial is designed to evaluate if SGN-CD33A in combination with the HMAs azacitidine or decitabine can extend overall survival compared to either HMA alone in older patients with newly diagnosed AML. Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 ratio to be treated with an HMA plus SGN-CD33A or an HMA plus placebo. The secondary endpoints include the comparison of composite complete remission rate (complete remission and complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery), event-free and leukemia-free survival, duration of response, safety, and 30- and 60-day mortality rates. Treatment and patient enrollment in this trial is ongoing. 
 
Our decision to initiate the CASCADE trial was supported by interim data from a phase 1 open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation clinical trial of SGN-CD33A as monotherapy or in combination with other standard treatments. In addition, the trial was evaluating anti-leukemic activity, pharmacokinetics, PFS and overall survival in patients with CD33-positive AML. At the December 2016 ASH annual meeting, we reported updated data from a cohort of this trial that evaluated SGN-CD33A in combination with an HMA. Of 49 patients evaluable for response, 73 percent of patients achieved a complete remission or complete remission with incomplete platelet or neutrophil recovery. With a median follow-up of 14.7 months, median overall survival for all patients was 11.3 months and 28 percent of patients remained alive and on study as of last follow-up. The 30- and 60-day mortality rates were two and eight percent, with no treatment-related deaths occurring during that time. The most common Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in 20 percent or more of patients were thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, anemia and neutropenia. The most common Grade 1 and 2 treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in 20 percent or more of patients were fatigue, nausea, constipation, peripheral edema and decreased appetite. In December 2016, this phase 1 trial was placed on a partial clinical hold by the FDA. Under the partial clinical hold, existing patients in the trial may continue treatment with SGN-CD33A following execution of an additional informed consent form, but no new patients may be enrolled in the trial. 
 
In February 2016, we initiated a phase 1/2, open label, multi-center clinical trial of SGN-CD33A in combination with azacitidine in patients with previously untreated Intermediate-2 or high risk MDS. Phase 1 of the study will identify the recommended dose of SGN-CD33A when combined with azacitidine in this patient population. The phase 2 portion of the trial will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating azacitidine with or without SGN-CD33A. The primary endpoint in phase 1 is determination of the recommended SGN-CD33A dose in combination with azacitidine. The primary endpoint in phase 2 is to compare the overall response rate between the two treatment arms. The secondary endpoints include evaluation of safety, best response, duration of response, PFS and overall survival. Treatment and patient enrollment in this trial is ongoing. 
 
In December 2014, we initiated a phase 1b, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation clinical trial designed to evaluate SGN-CD33A administered in combination with frontline standard of care regimens for induction (cytarabine and daunorubicin, also known as 7+3) for younger patients with newly diagnosed AML. The trial was also designed to evaluate SGN-CD33A in the consolidation setting for AML, both in combination with 
 
13 
 
 cytarabine and as a single-agent maintenance regimen. The primary endpoints are determination of the maximum tolerated dose and safety profile of SGN-CD33A. In addition, the trial was evaluating anti-leukemic activity, pharmacokinetics, PFS and overall survival. At the ASH 2016 annual meeting, we reported interim data showing that of 42 patients evaluable for response, 76 percent achieved a complete remission or complete remission with incomplete platelet or neutrophil recovery. Among patients who achieved a remission, 78 percent were negative for minimal residual disease. Median OS had not yet been reached. The 30-day mortality rate was two percent. The most common Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in 20 percent or more of patients were febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia. The most common Grade 1 and 2 treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in 20 percent or more of patients were nausea, diarrhea, constipation, hypokalemia and decreased appetite. In December 2016, this phase 1b trial was placed on partial clinical hold by the FDA. Under the partial clinical hold, existing patients in the trial may continue treatment with SGN-CD33A following execution of an additional informed consent form, but no new patients may be enrolled in the trial. 
 
In November 2015, we initiated a phase 1/2 clinical trial of SGN-CD33A in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. The trial was designed to evaluate SGN-CD33A monotherapy as a pre-conditioning regimen prior to an allogeneic stem cell transplant and also for use as maintenance therapy following transplant. In December 2016, this trial was placed on full clinical hold by the FDA. Under the full clinical hold, all patients in the trial were required to discontinue treatment with SGN-CD33A immediately and no new patients may be enrolled in the trial. 
 
We may be unable to submit to the FDA all required clinical follow-up information to respond to the clinical holds. Even if we are able to provide such information, the FDA may not deem the information to be sufficient to lift any or all of the clinical holds. In addition, we may encounter delays in reaching an agreement with the FDA regarding the terms under which these trials may be resumed, or we may elect to discontinue one or more of these trials for safety or any other reasons. Furthermore, the FDA may require us to implement additional, potentially burdensome pharmacovigilance procedures or conduct additional pre-clinical studies before it will consider lifting the clinical holds, if at all. In addition, although the FDA has not placed a clinical hold on the CASCADE trial or our phase 1/2 trial in MDS and we continue to enroll patients in these trials, we cannot assure you that the FDA or another regulatory authority will not place a clinical hold on one or both of these trials. If we are unable to submit required information to the FDA in a timely manner, or at all; if the FDA does not lift the clinical holds in a timely manner, or at all; if the FDA does not permit us to initiate additional trials of SGN-CD33A and/or the FDA imposes clinical holds on the CASCADE trial or our phase 1/2 trial in MDS; or if there are additional safety results, including from our ongoing trials of SGN-CD33A, that alter the benefit-risk profile of SGN-CD33A or cause it to become unacceptable, we would be further delayed or prevented from advancing the clinical development of SGN-CD33A, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. 
 
ASG-22ME (Enfortumab Vedotin) 
 
ASG-22ME is an ADC composed of an anti-Nectin-4 monoclonal antibody linked to a potent auristatin compound using our proprietary ADC technology. Nectin-4 is a novel target expressed in multiple cancers including urothelial cancers, such as bladder cancer, as well as ovarian and lung cancers. We are developing ASG-22ME as a potential treatment of solid tumors under our co-development collaboration with Astellas. 
 
In October 2016, we reported interim data from a phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation, multi-center clinical trial of ASG-22ME at the European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO, annual meeting. Of the 49 metastatic urothelial cancer patients evaluable for response, 37 percent had an objective response, including two percent who achieved a complete response. The preliminary estimate of median PFS was 16.6 weeks. At the recommended phase 2 dose of 1.25 mg/kg, 17 patients were treated of which 59 percent had a partial response. In the 16 patients across dose levels who had previously been treated with checkpoint inhibitors, 38 percent achieved a partial response. Among the seven patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose that had 
 
14 
 
 previously been treated with checkpoint inhibitors, 57 percent achieved a partial response. The most common treatment related adverse events of any grade occurring in 20 percent or more of patients were pruritis (31 percent), fatigue (30 percent), diarrhea (29 percent), nausea (28 percent), rash (26 percent) and alopecia (21 percent). 
 
Based on these interim phase 1 data, we and Astellas are planning discussions with regulatory agencies during 2017 to advance the program into potential registrational trials of ASG-22ME in urothelial cancer patients, including patients who have been previously treated with a checkpoint inhibitor therapy. 
 
SGN-LIV1A 
 
SGN-LIV1A is an ADC composed of an anti-LIV-1 monoclonal antibody linked to a potent auristatin compound using our proprietary ADC technology, and is being developed as a potential treatment of LIV-1-positive metastatic breast cancer. 
 
In October 2013 we initiated a phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation clinical trial to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of SGN-LIV1A in patients with LIV-1-positive metastatic breast cancer. At the December 2016 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium annual meeting, updated interim data were reported showing that among 30 evaluable patients with triple negative disease, 37 percent achieved a partial response. The estimated median PFS for these patients was 12 weeks with seven patients remaining on treatment. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached among doses ranging from 0.5 to 2.8 mg/kg. For all patients in the study, the most common adverse events of any grade occurring in 20 percent or more of patients included fatigue (57 percent), nausea (53 percent), alopecia (42 percent), decreased appetite (34 percent) and constipation (32 percent). The incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia at the 2.5 mg/kg dose was 50 percent. Two patients (seven percent) experienced febrile neutropenia, and there was one treatment-related death due to sepsis. Based on these safety data, a separate expansion cohort at 2.0 mg/kg is currently being evaluated. In addition, enrollment is ongoing for patients with HER2 positive breast cancer to evaluate SGN-LIV1A in combination with trastuzumab. 
 
SGN-CD19A (Denintuzumab Mafodotin) 
 
SGN-CD19A is an ADC composed of an anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody linked to a potent auristatin compound using our proprietary ADC technology. CD19 is a B-cell antigen that is expressed in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 
 
In October 2015, we announced the initiation of a phase 2 randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical trial of SGN-CD19A in combination with the second-line salvage regimen of rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide, or RICE, for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. The primary endpoint is to compare the complete remission rates between the two study arms. Secondary endpoints include safety of the combination regimen, PFS, overall survival and the number of patients who are able to undergo ASCT. 
 
In October 2016, we announced the initiation of a phase 2 clinical trial of SGN-CD19A in patients with newly-diagnosed DLBCL. The trial will assess the activity and tolerability of adding SGN-CD19A to the standard frontline regimen, R-CHOP, as well as a modified regimen, R-CHP. The primary endpoints are to evaluate the complete remission rate and tolerability profile of the combinations. Secondary endpoints include event-free survival, PFS, overall survival and duration of response. 
 
SEA-CD40 
 
SEA-CD40 utilizes our novel proprietary SEA technology to produce a non-fucosylated antibody targeting CD40, which is believed to work as an immuno-oncology molecule, activating certain immune cells. It builds on our extensive experience targeting CD40. In February 2015, we announced initiation of a phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation clinical trial of SEA-CD40 in patients with advanced solid tumors who have failed current standard of care treatments. Expansion cohorts are planned to evaluate SEA-CD40 across up to three 
 
15 
 
 cancer indications that will be determined based on data from the dose escalation portion of the study. The primary endpoints are determination of the maximum tolerated dose and safety profile of SEA-CD40. In addition, the trial will evaluate antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics and immunological pharmacodynamic effects. In 2016, the phase 1 trial was expanded to evaluate patients with hematologic malignancies. 
 
SGN-CD19B 
 
SGN-CD19B is a proprietary ADC composed of an anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody utilizing our proprietary EC-mAb technology linked to a potent PBD dimer. We are developing this product candidate as a potential treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In February 2016, we announced initiation of a phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation clinical trial of SGN-CD19B for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL or grade 3 follicular lymphoma. The primary endpoints are the estimation of the maximum tolerated dose and evaluation of the safety of SGN-CD19B. In addition, the trial will evaluate antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics, objective response rate and PFS. 
 
SGN-CD123A 
 
SGN-CD123A is a proprietary ADC composed of an anti-CD123 monoclonal antibody utilizing our proprietary EC-mAb technology linked to a potent PBD dimer. We are developing this product candidate as a potential treatment of AML. In September 2016, we announced initiation of a phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation clinical trial of SGN-CD123A for patients with relapsed or refractory AML. It will initially evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of SGN-CD123A, followed by an expansion cohort to further define safety and estimate anti-leukemic activity. In addition, the trial will assess pharmacokinetics, remission rate, duration of complete remission and overall survival. 
 
SGN-CD352A 
 
SGN-CD352A is a proprietary ADC composed of an anti-CD352 monoclonal antibody utilizing our proprietary EC-mAb technology linked to a potent PBD dimer. In January 2017, we announced initiation of a phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation clinical trial of SGN-CD352A for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The trial will be conducted in two parts, with a dose escalation part to identify the maximum tolerated dose of SGN-CD352A followed by an expansion part to further define safety and antitumor activity. 
 
SGN-2FF 
 
SGN-2FF is a novel small molecule immuno-oncology agent. It is an oral agent that has been shown in preclinical models to inhibit fucosylation of proteins, which may make tumors more visible to the immune system, and thereby slow the growth and spread of cancer cells. In January 2017, we initiated an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation clinical trial of SGN-2FF for patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer. 
 
ASG-15ME 
 
ASG-15ME is an ADC composed of an anti-SLITRK6 monoclonal antibody linked to a potent auristatin compound using our proprietary ADC technology. We are developing ASG-15ME under our co-development collaboration with Astellas. A phase 1 clinical trial of ASG-15ME for the treatment of metastatic urothelial cancer, notably bladder cancer, was initiated in October 2013. This trial is evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile and antitumor activity of escalating doses of ASG-15ME. We and Astellas are focusing our development activities on ASG-22ME for metastatic urothelial cancer, while evaluating next development steps for ASG-15ME. 
 
Research Programs 
 
In addition to our pipeline of product candidates and antibody-based and SEA technologies, we have internal research programs directed toward developing new classes of potent, cell-killing agents and stable 
 
16 
 
 linkers, identifying novel antigen targets, monoclonal antibodies and other targeting molecules, and advancing our antibody engineering initiatives. 
 
New Cell-Killing Agents.    We continue to study new cell-killing agents that can be linked to antibodies, such as the auristatins and PBDs that we currently use in our ADC technology, and new classes of cell-killing agents. 
 
New Stable Linkers.    We are conducting research with the intent to develop new linker systems that are more stable in the bloodstream and more effective at releasing the cell-killing agent once inside targeted cancer cells. 
 
Novel Monoclonal Antibodies and Antigen Targets.    We are actively engaged in internal efforts to identify and develop monoclonal antibodies and other targeting molecules and ADCs with novel specificities and activities against selected antigen targets. We focus on antigen targets that are highly expressed on the surface of cancer cells that may serve as targets for monoclonal antibodies or ADCs. We may then create and screen panels of cancer-reactive monoclonal antibodies in our laboratories to identify those with the desired specificity. We supplement these internal efforts by evaluating opportunities to in-license targets and antibodies from academic groups and other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, such as our ongoing co-development collaboration with Genmab. 
 
Antibody Engineering.    We have substantial internal expertise in antibody engineering, both for antibody humanization and non-fucosylation, as well as engineering of antibodies to improve drug linkage sites for use with our ADC technology. By modifying the number and type of drug-linkage sites found on our antibodies, we believe that we can improve the robustness and cost-effectiveness of our manufacturing processes for conjugation of ADCs. 
 
Research and Development Expense 
 
Since inception, we have devoted a significant amount of resources to develop ADCETRIS, our product candidates and our antibody-based technologies. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recorded $379.3 million, $294.5 million, and $230.7 million, respectively, in research and development expenses. 
Corporate Collaborations 
 
We enter into collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to advance the development and commercialization of our product candidates and to supplement our internal pipeline. We seek collaborations that will allow us to retain significant future participation in product sales through either profit-sharing or royalties paid on net sales. We also license our ADC technology to collaborators to be developed with their own antibodies. These ADC collaborations benefit us in many ways, including generating cash flow and revenues that partially offset expenditures on our internal research and development programs, expanding our knowledge base regarding ADCs across multiple targets and antibodies provided by our collaborators and providing us with future pipeline opportunities through co-development or opt-in rights to new ADC product candidates.

In December 2009, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS, under which Seattle Genetics retains commercial rights in the United States and its territories and in Canada, and Takeda and its Takeda affiliates have commercial rights in the rest of the world. As of December 31, 2016, we had received an upfront payment of $60 million and had achieved milestone payments totaling $70 million related to regulatory and commercial progress by Takeda. As of December 31, 2016, we were entitled to receive additional progress- and sales-dependent milestone payments of up to $165 million based on Takedas achievement of significant events under the collaboration in addition to tiered royalties with percentages starting in the mid-teens and escalating to the mid-twenties based on net sales of ADCETRIS within Takedas licensed 
 
17 
 
 territories. Takeda also bears a portion of third-party royalty costs owed on sales of ADCETRIS in its territory. We and Takeda equally co-fund the cost of development activities conducted under the collaboration. Although we are funding half of the development activities conducted under the collaboration, Takeda is responsible for the achievement of the progress- and sales-dependent milestone payments that we may receive. Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and such breach remains uncured. Takeda may terminate the collaboration agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to us and we may terminate the collaboration agreement in certain circumstances. The collaboration agreement can also be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties. If neither party terminates the collaboration agreement, then the agreement automatically terminates on the expiration of all payment obligations. 
 
Astellas Co-Development Collaboration 
 
In January 2007, we entered into an agreement with Astellas to jointly research, develop and commercialize ADCs for the treatment of several types of cancer. The collaboration encompasses combinations of our ADC technology with fully-human antibodies developed by Astellas to proprietary cancer targets. 
 
Under the collaboration agreement, we and Astellas are co-funding all development and commercialization costs for ASG-22ME and ASG-15ME, and will share on a 50/50 basis in any profits that may come from these product candidates if successfully commercialized. Costs associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense. 
 
Astellas has the right to develop and commercialize certain other ADC product candidates on its own, subject to paying us annual maintenance fees, milestones, royalties and support fees for research and development services and material provided under the collaboration agreement. We are entitled to receive progress- and sales-dependent milestone payments of up to approximately $96 million based on Astellas achievement of significant events under the collaboration in addition to mid-single digit royalties on net sales of any of these other ADC product candidates by Astellas. Either party may opt out of co-development and profit-sharing in return for receiving milestones and royalties from the continuing party. Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement if the other party becomes insolvent or the other party materially breaches the agreement and such breach remains uncured. Subject to certain restrictions, either party may terminate the collaboration agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to the other party. The collaboration agreement can also be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties. If neither party exercises its option to terminate the collaboration agreement, then the agreement will automatically terminate on the later of: (a) the expiration of all payment obligations pursuant to the collaboration agreement, or (b) the day upon which we and Astellas cease to develop and commercialize products under the agreement. 
 
Unum Therapeutics Collaboration 
 
In June 2015, we entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement with Unum to develop and commercialize novel ACTR therapies incorporating our antibodies for cancer. Unums proprietary ACTR technology enables programming of a patients T-cells to attack tumor cells when co-administered with tumor-specific therapeutic antibodies. Through our research and development in the field of ADCs, we have a substantial portfolio of cancer targets and tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies from which programs will be selected for the collaboration with Unum. Under the terms of the agreement, we and Unum will initially develop two ACTR product candidates that combine Unums ACTR technology with our antibodies, and we have an option to expand the collaboration to include a third ACTR product candidate upon payment of an additional fee. Unum is obligated to conduct preclinical research and clinical development activities through phase 1 clinical trials and we are obligated to provide funding for these activities. The agreement calls for us to work together to co-develop and jointly fund programs after phase 1 clinical trials unless either company opts out. We and Unum would co-commercialize any successfully developed product candidates and share any profits 50/50 on any co-developed programs in the United States. We retain exclusive commercial rights outside of the United States, paying Unum a royalty that is a high single digit to mid-teens percentage of ex-U.S. sales, if any. The potential future licensing and progress-dependent milestone payments to Unum under the collaboration may total up to 
 
18 
 
 $615 million across all three ACTR programs, payment of which is triggered by the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones. As of the date of this filing, this agreement is not material to us. 
 
Genmab Co-Development Collaboration 
 
In September 2010, we entered into an ADC research collaboration agreement with Genmab. Under the agreement, Genmab has rights to utilize our ADC technology with its HuMax-TF antibody targeting the Tissue Factor, or TF, antigen, which is expressed on numerous types of solid tumors. Under this agreement, we received an upfront payment and have the right to exercise a co-development option for any resulting ADC products at the end of phase 1 clinical development. Genmab is responsible for research, manufacturing, preclinical development and phase 1 clinical trials under the collaboration. We receive research support payments for any assistance provided to Genmab. If we opt into the anti-TF ADC product at the end of phase 1, we and Genmab would co-develop and share all future costs and profits for the product on a 50/50 basis. If we do not opt in, then Genmab would pay us fees, milestones and mid-single digit royalties on worldwide net sales of the product. As of the date of this filing, this agreement is not material to us. 
 
ADC Collaborations 
 
We have active collaborations with a number of companies to allow them to use our proprietary ADC technology with their monoclonal antibodies. Under our ADC collaborations, which we enter into in the ordinary course of business, we receive or are entitled to receive upfront cash payments, progress-dependent milestones and single digit royalties on net sales of products incorporating our ADC technology, as well as annual maintenance fees and support fees for research and development services and materials provided under the agreements. Our ADC collaborators are responsible for development, manufacturing and commercialization of any ADC product candidates that result from the collaborations and are solely responsible for the achievement of any of the potential milestones under these collaborations. 
 
19 
 
Our current ADC collaborations are at various stages of clinical and preclinical development. Our ability to generate significant future revenues from our current ADC collaboration agreements will largely depend on a product that incorporates our ADC technology entering late-stage clinical development and receiving marketing approval from the FDA at which point the milestone payments, royalties or other rights and benefits would become more substantial and material to our company. Below is a table setting forth our active ADC collaborations and current development status: 
 


License Agreements 
 
We have in-licensed antibodies, targets and enabling technologies from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutions for use in our pipeline programs and ADC technology, including the following: 
 
Bristol-Myers Squibb License.    In March 1998, we obtained rights to some of our technologies and product candidates, portions of which are exclusive, through a license agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Through this license, we secured rights to use various targeting technologies. Under the terms of the license agreement, we are required to pay royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products, including ADCETRIS, which incorporate various technologies owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
 
University of Miami License.    In September 1999, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Miami, Florida, covering an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody that is the basis for the antibody component of ADCETRIS. Under the terms of this license, we made an upfront payment and are required to pay annual maintenance fees, progress-dependent milestone payments and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products, including ADCETRIS, incorporating technology licensed from the University of Miami. 
 
Immunomedics License.     On February 10, 2017, we entered into the Immunomedics License. Pursuant to the Immunomedics License, Immunomedics granted us, subject to the terms and conditions of the Immunomedics License, exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize IMMU-132 and second generation ADCs targeting TROP-2 for all human therapeutics uses in any and all indications. IMMU-132 is an ADC targeted to TROP-2, which is expressed in several solid tumors, and is in a pivotal phase 1/2 trial for patients with TNBC, and is being investigated in other solid tumors. Under the Immunomedics License, we 
 
20 
 
 agreed to pay Immunomedics an up-front payment of $250 million following closing of the Immunomedics License. In addition, we agreed to pay development, regulatory and sales-dependent milestone payments to Immunomedics across multiple indications and geographic regions of up to a total maximum of approximately $1.7 billion. Immunomedics would also be eligible to receive royalties on worldwide annual net sales of licensed products at tiered royalty rate percentages beginning in the teens and rising to twenty percent, subject to customary reductions, during the royalty term specified in the Immunomedics License. We would bear the future costs of worldwide development and commercialization of licensed products, subject to specified exceptions. We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop IMMU-132. Following regulatory approval (and pricing and reimbursement approvals, as applicable) of any licensed product in any of the major market countries specified in the Immunomedics License, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize such licensed product in each major market country where it has been approved. Under the Immunomedics License, Immunomedics would have the right to exercise a co-promotion option to provide up to 50% of the sales efforts for the commercialization of IMMU-132 in the United States, subject to certain parameters set forth in the Immunomedics License. We may terminate the Immunomedics License for convenience upon at least two hundred seventy (270) days prior written notice to Immunomedics. Either we or Immunomedics may terminate the Immunomedics License if the other party is in material breach of the Immunomedics License and fails to cure such breach within specified cure periods. Upon a termination of the Immunomedics License by us for convenience or by Immunomedics for our material breach, all licenses granted by Immunomedics to us terminate (other than specified exceptions), and all payment obligations that accrued prior to the date of such termination shall survive the termination, among other effects of termination. The Immunomedics License also provides us the right to terminate specified portions of the Immunomedics License in the event of certain fundamental breaches by Immunomedics that are not cured in accordance with specified cure periods and procedures. In connection with our entry into the Immunomedics License, we purchased 3,000,000 shares of Immunomedics common stock from Immunomedics at an aggregate purchase price of $14.7 million, and also received a warrant from Immunomedics to purchase up to 8,655,804 additional shares of Immunomedics common stock. 
 
The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, there being no pending court or administrative challenges to the Immunomedics License and there being no court or administrative orders blocking the closing. On February 20, 2017, Immunomedics and we entered into a letter agreement pursuant to which Immunomedics irrevocably waived to the extent applicable to Immunomedics the condition precedent to the closing and effectiveness of the Immunomedics License that there be no pending court or administrative challenges to the transaction. Additionally, under the terms of the Immunomedics License, Immunomedics had the right to continue discussions with a small number of parties that previously expressed interest in licensing IMMU-132 until 11:59 p.m. New York City time on February 19, 2017. If a third party had provided Immunomedics with a financially superior licensing offer, we would have had the right to match any such offer, and if we had decided not to match, Immunomedics would have had the right to accept the superior offer and terminate the Immunomedics License upon payment of a termination fee to us. We have not received notice from Immunomedics of any such third party offers during this limited time period, and on February 21, 2017, Immunomedics announced that it is subject to customary no-shop restrictions on its and its representatives ability to solicit, discuss or negotiate alternative licensing agreement proposals from third parties with regard to IMMU-132. On February 13, 2017, we were named a co-defendant in a lawsuit filed by venBio in the Delaware Chancery Court against the members of the board of directors of Immunomedics pursuant to which, among other things, venBio seeks to enjoin the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License. As a result of the pending litigation challenging the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License, Immunomedics and we have committed to the Court not to close the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License prior to March 10, 2017. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of this lawsuit or the impact it may have on the Immunomedics License or the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License. However, it is possible that, in connection with this lawsuit, the Immunomedics License could be rescinded or reformed in a way that is disadvantageous to us, including by requiring us to increase the transaction consideration payable to Immunomedics under the Immunomedics License, or that otherwise adversely affects the anticipated benefits to us of the Immunomedics License.

Patents and Proprietary Technology 
 
Our owned and licensed patents and patent applications are directed to ADCETRIS, our product candidates, monoclonal antibodies, our ADC and SEA technologies and other antibody-based and/or enabling technologies. We commonly seek patent claims directed to compositions of matter, including antibodies, ADCs, and drug-linkers containing highly potent cell-killing agents, as well as methods of using such compositions. When appropriate, we also seek claims to related technologies, such as methods of using certain sugar analogs utilized in our SEA technology. For ADCETRIS and each of our product candidates, we have filed or expect to file multiple patent applications. We maintain patents and prosecute applications worldwide for technologies that we have out-licensed, such as our ADC technology. Similarly, for partnered products and product candidates, such as ADCETRIS, ASG-22ME, and ASG-15ME, we seek to work closely with our development partners to coordinate patent efforts, including patent application filings, prosecution, term extension, defense and enforcement. As ADCETRIS and our development product candidates advance through research and development, we seek to diligently identify and protect new inventions, such as combination therapies, improvements to methods of manufacturing, and methods of treatment. We also work closely with our scientific personnel to identify and protect new inventions that could eventually add to our development pipeline. 
 
For ADCETRIS and our related ADC technology, we own nine patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2020 and 2031. For SGN-CD33A and our related ADC technology, we own, co-own or have licensed rights to six patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2027 and 2032. For ASG-22ME and our related ADC technology, we own, co-own or have licensed rights to nine patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2022 and 2031. Of these nine patents, we own or co-own seven patents and have licensed rights to two patents. For SGN-LIV1A and our related ADC technology, we own or have licensed rights to seven patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2020 and 2032. Of these seven patents, we own rights to five patents and have licensed rights to two patents. Of these six patents, we own or co-own four patents and have licensed rights to two patents. For SGN-CD19A and our related ADC technology, we own eleven patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2024 and 2029. For SEA-CD40 and our related SEA technology, we own or have licensed rights to eleven patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2020 and 2030. Of these eleven patents, we own eight patents and have licensed rights to three patents. For ASG-15ME and our related ADC technology, we own or co-own five patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2022 and 2033. In some cases, our U.S. patents may be eligible for patent term extension, and our European patents may be eligible for supplemental protection in one or more countries. The length of any such extension would vary by country. 
 
Patents expire, on a country by country basis, at various times depending on various factors, including the filing date of the corresponding patent application(s), the availability of patent term extension and supplemental protection certificates and requirements for terminal disclaimers. Although we believe our owned and licensed patents and patent applications provide us with a competitive advantage, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We and our corporate collaborators may not be able to develop patentable products or processes or obtain patents from pending patent applications. Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue. In the event of issuance, the patents may not be sufficient to protect the proprietary technology owned by or licensed to us or our corporate collaborators. Our or our collaborators current patents, or patents that issue on pending applications, may be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented. In addition, changes to patent laws in the United States or other countries may limit our ability to defend or enforce our patents, or may applied retroactively to affect the term of our patents. Our patents have been and may in the future be challenged by third parties in post-issuance administrative proceedings or in litigation as invalid, not infringed or unenforceable under U.S. or foreign laws, or they may be infringed by third parties. As a result, we are or may be from time to time involved in the defense and enforcement of our patent or other intellectual property rights in a court of law, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office inter partes review or reexamination proceeding, foreign opposition proceeding or related legal and administrative proceeding in the United States and elsewhere. The costs of defending our patents or enforcing our proprietary rights in post-issuance administrative proceedings or litigation may be substantial and 
 
22 
 
 the outcome can be uncertain. An adverse outcome may allow third parties to use our proprietary technologies without a license from us or our collaborators. Our and our collaborators patents may also be circumvented, which may allow third parties to use similar technologies without a license from us or our collaborators. 
 
Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Organizations such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and research institutions may have filed patent applications or may have been granted patents that cover technologies similar to the technologies owned, optioned by or licensed to us or to our collaborators. In addition, we are monitoring the progress of multiple pending patent applications of other organizations that, if granted, may require us to license or challenge their validity or enforceability in order to continue commercializing ADCETRIS or to commercialize our product candidates. Our challenges to patents of other organizations may not be successful, which may affect our ability to commercialize ADCETRIS or our product candidates. We cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our or our collaborators ability to make, use or sell ADCETRIS or any other products. 
 
We require our scientific personnel to maintain laboratory notebooks and other research records in accordance with our policies, which are designed to strengthen and support our intellectual property protection. In addition to our patented intellectual property, we also rely on trade secrets and other proprietary information, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a proprietary information and inventions assignment agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. These agreements provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements also provide that we will own all inventions conceived or reduced to practice by the individual in the course of rendering services to us. Our agreements with collaborators require them to have a similar policy and agreements with their employees, consultants and advisors. Our policy and agreements and those of our collaborators may not sufficiently protect our confidential information, or third parties may independently develop equivalent information. 
 
Government Regulation 
 
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, pre-market approval, manufacture, marketing and distribution of biopharmaceutical products. These agencies and other regulatory agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, distribution, import, export, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion of products and product candidates. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in Warning Letters, civil or criminal penalties, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market. The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. We must obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA before we can begin marketing them in the United States. Similar approvals are also required in other countries. 
 
Product development and approval within this regulatory framework is uncertain, can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. The nature and extent of the governmental review process for our product candidates will vary, depending on the regulatory categorization of particular product candidates and various other factors. 
 
The necessary steps before a new biopharmaceutical product may be sold in the United States ordinarily include: 
 

 | preclinical in vitro and in vivo tests, some of which must comply with Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
23 
 

 | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical trials may commence, and which must be updated at least annually with a report on development;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | development of a drug formulation and manufacture of the drug product for clinical trials, and commercial sale, if approved;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of a marketing authorization application in the form of a BLA, which must be accompanied by a substantial user fee unless the fee is waived;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities for current Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, compliance and FDA inspection of select clinical trial sites for Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, compliance; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the marketing authorization application and product prescribing information prior to any commercial sale.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The results of preclinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as preclinical GLP studies to evaluate toxicity) for a particular product candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, and a clinical protocol are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30 day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. IND submissions may be authorized by the FDA, for example, to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually-identifiable information. 
 
Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or in some instances, be skipped. In phase 1, the initial introduction of the product into humans, the product candidate is tested to assess safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacological actions associated with increasing doses. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to evaluate the efficacy of the potential product for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimum dosage and further identify possible adverse reactions and safety risks. Phase 3 and pivotal trials are undertaken to evaluate further clinical efficacy and safety often in comparison to standard therapies within a broader patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical sites. Phase 4, or post-marketing, trials may be required as a condition of commercial approval by the FDA and may also be voluntarily initiated by us or our collaborators. Since we received accelerated approval for ADCETRIS from the FDA for the relapsed sALCL indication, we are subject to certain post-approval requirements pursuant to which we are conducting an additional confirmatory phase 3 trial, the ECHELON-2 trial, to verify and describe the clinical benefit of ADCETRIS in the relapsed sALCL indication. Phase 1, phase 2 or phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specific period of time, if at all, with respect to any of our product candidates. Similarly, suggestions of safety, tolerability or efficacy in earlier stage trials do not necessarily predict findings of safety and efficacy in subsequent trials. Furthermore, the FDA, an IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical trials are subject to central registration and results reporting requirements, such as on www.clinicaltrials.gov. 
 
The results of preclinical studies, pharmaceutical development and clinical trials, together with information on a products chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA, for approval of the manufacture, marketing and commercial shipment of the pharmaceutical product. Data from 
 
24 
 
 clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. The FDA may also convene an Advisory Committee of external advisors to answer questions regarding the approvability and labeling of an application. The FDA is not obligated to follow the Advisory Committees recommendation. The submission of a BLA is required to be accompanied by a substantial user fee, with few exceptions or waivers. The user fee is administered under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, which sets goals for the timeliness of the FDAs review. A standard review period is twelve months from submission of the application, while priority review is eight months from submission of the application. The testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time, effort and resources, and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may deny review of an application by refusing to file the application or not approve an application by issuance of a complete response letter if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, or require post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Approval may occur with significant Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, that limit the clinical use in the prescribing information, distribution or promotion of a product. Accelerated approval of ADCETRIS for relapsed sALCL additionally requires the pre-submission of marketing materials to the FDA for the product until such time as the accelerated approval requirements have been fulfilled. Once an approval is issued, the FDA may require safety-related labeling changes or withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require further testing of ADCETRIS, including phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of ADCETRIS, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of ADCETRIS based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information. 
 
Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including manufacture, labeling, distribution, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, annual product quality review and reporting requirements. Adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form FDA 483 and Warning Letters that could cause us to modify certain activities. A Form FDA 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, can list conditions the FDA investigators believe may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations or guidance. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observations(s) can result in further regulatory enforcement action. In addition to Form FDA 483 notices and Warning Letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, not approve our products, require us to recall a product from distribution or withdraw approval of the BLA for that product. Failure to comply with ongoing regulatory obligations can result in delay of approval or Warning Letters, product seizures, criminal penalties, and withdrawal of approved products, among other enforcement remedies. 
 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. These regulations include standards and restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet, and off-label promotion. While physicians may prescribe products for off label uses, manufacturers may only promote products for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a Warning Letter directing entities to correct deviations from FDA standards, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. 
 
25 
 
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics 
 
ADCETRIS and certain of our product candidates may rely upon in vitro companion diagnostics for use in selecting the patients that we believe will respond to our therapeutics. If safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that FDA approves the therapeutic product. This policy is described in an August 2014 FDA guidance document. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our cancer treatments involves coordination of review by FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health. For example, we and Takeda have formed a collaboration with Ventana under which Ventana is working to develop, manufacture and commercialize a molecular companion diagnostic test with the goal of identifying patients who might respond to treatment with ADCETRIS based on CD30 expression levels in their tissue specimens, which companion diagnostic may be required by regulatory authorities to support regulatory approval of ADCETRIS in other CD30-expressing malignancies. 
 
Regulation Outside of the United States 
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we and our collaborators are and will be subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and commercial sales, manufacturing and distribution of our products. We must obtain approval by the regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as Canada, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
Healthcare Regulation 
 
Federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws and regulations, may also be applicable to our business. If we fail to comply with those laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation, anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. 
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item, or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statutes intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively PPACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 
 
26 
 
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to or approval by the federal government, including the Medicare, and Medicaid programs, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. 
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, PPACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAAs security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under PPACA and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Childrens Health Insurance Program to annually report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for knowing failures. Covered manufacturers are required to submit reports on aggregate payment data to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on an annual basis. 
 
Many states have similar statutes or regulations to the above federal laws and regulations that may be broader in scope than the aforementioned federal versions and apply regardless of payor, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicating compliance efforts. Additionally, our business operations in foreign countries and jurisdictions, including Canada and the European Union, may subject us to additional regulation. 
 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially 
 
27 
 
 significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
 
Sales of ADCETRIS and any future products depend, in significant part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Patients who are prescribed treatment for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients and providers are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Pharmaceutical products are typically reimbursed based on FDA labeled indications, recognized compendia listings, available medical literature and determination of medical necessity. 
 
Additionally, a third-party payors decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for each of our product candidates is individual to each insurer, can vary based on provider contract, and will be affected by state and federal laws providing for reimbursement formulas based on acquisition cost. Third party payors continue to work diligently to control their spending on prescription drugs and medical service. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of the U.S. government and abroad, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Payors, commercial and public in the U.S. and abroad, must review the therapeutics value of our products before extending coverage under their plans to reimburse our products If third-party payors do not find a product to be of therapeutic value, they may not cover it or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 
 
Many of the patients in the U.S. who seek treatment with ADCETRIS may be eligible for Medicare or Medicaid benefits. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and coverage and reimbursement for products and services under these programs are subject to changes in CMS regulations and interpretive policy determinations, in addition to statutory changes made by Congress. Federal budget decisions have and may result in reduced Medicare payment rates. In addition, as a condition of federal funds being made available to cover our products under Medicaid, we are required to participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program. The rebate amount under this program varies by quarter, and is based on pricing data we report to CMS. In addition, because we participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program, we must make ADCETRIS available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration. This requires compliance with additional laws and requirements, including offering ADCETRIS at a reduced price to federal agencies including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and United States Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and the Indian Health Service. We are also required to offer discounted pricing to certain eligible not for profit entities that are eligible for 340B pricing under the Public Health Services Act. Participation in these programs requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in 
 
28 
 
 personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate our prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, as well as, administrative burdens and exclusion from or contract termination regarding these programs. The terms of these government programs could change in the future which may increase the discounts or rebates we are required to offer, possibly reducing the revenue derived from sales of ADCETRIS to these entities. 
 
The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. 
 
Healthcare Reform 
 
PPACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affects the pharmaceutical industry. PPACA aims to, among other things, expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, PPACA is expected to, among other things, expand and increase industry rebates for products covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. We cannot yet predict the full impact of PPACA at this time for many reasons including that many of its provisions require the promulgation of detailed implementing regulations, which has not yet occurred. 
 
Many provisions of PPACA may impact the biopharmaceutical industry, including that in order for a biopharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the drug pricing program under the Public Health Services Act, or PHS. The required PHS discount on a given product is calculated based on the Average Manufacturers Price, or AMP, and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. PPACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted PHS pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of childrens hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted PHS pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as PHS drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, revisions, including the recently published AMP rule, to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required PHS discount to increase. 
 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of PPACA. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of PPACA. The Budget Resolution is not a law; however, it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of PPACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The potential impact of these efforts to repeal or defer and delay enforcement of PPACA on our business remains unclear. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of PPACA that are repealed. Because of the continued uncertainty about the implementation of the PPACA, including the potential for further legal challenges or repeal of PPACA, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of the PPACA or its repeal on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislations automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers, which went into effect in April 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect 
 
29 
 
 through 2025 unless additional congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 
Further, the recently enacted Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes on manufacturers of certain pharmaceutical products new obligations related to product tracking and tracing, among others, which will be phased in over several years beginning in 2015. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers subject to this federal law will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Covered manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, covered manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. 
 
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. 
 
We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. However, we anticipate that Congress, state legislatures, and third-party payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare delivery system. We also expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing, or effect of changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such potential legislation; however, such changes or the ultimate impact of changes could negatively affect our revenue or sales of ADCETRIS or any future approved products. 
 
Competition 
 
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Many third parties compete with us in developing various approaches to treating cancer. They include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions and other research organizations. 
 
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and marketing than we do. In addition, many of these competitors are active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements in anticipation of collecting royalties for use of technology that they have developed. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs. 
 
With respect to ADCETRIS, there are several other FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma or sALCL, including Bristol-Myers Squibbs Opdivo for Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of auto-HSCT and ADCETRIS and Celgenes Istodax and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals Folotyn for relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Merck is also developing a PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab, 
 
30 
 
 and is conducting a clinical trial in relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma comparing pembrolizumab with ADCETRIS. In addition, we are aware of multiple investigational agents that are currently being studied, including Pfizers crizotinib, AbbVies ibrutinib, Kyowas mogamulizumab, and Gileads idelalisib, which, if successful, may compete with ADCETRIS in the future. Data have also been presented on several developing technologies, including bispecific antibodies and CAR modified T-cell therapies that may compete with ADCETRIS in the future. Further, there are many competing approaches used in the treatment of patients in ADCETRIS three approved indications, including auto-HSCT, conventional therapies, combination chemotherapy, clinical trials with experimental agents and single-agent regimens. 
 
With respect to SGN-CD33A, there are several investigational agents that, if approved, could be competitive with our product candidate, including AbbVies venetoclax, which received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA in January 2016 for use in combination with HMAs in treatment-naïve patients with AML who are not eligible for standard high-dose induction treatment, Jazzs Vyxeos, Pfizers Mylotarg, Astexs guadecitabine (SGI-110), and agents targeting biomarkers such as FLT3 and IDH1/2. 
 
Many other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing and/or marketing therapies for the same types of cancer that our product candidates are designed and being developed to treat. For example, we believe that companies including AbbVie, ADC Therapeutics, Affimed, Agios, Amgen, Astellas, Bayer, Biogen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, Eisai, Genentech, GSK, Gilead, ImmunoGen, Immunomedics, Infinity, Karyopharm, MedImmune, MEI Pharma, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Takeda, Teva, and Xencor are developing and/or marketing products or technologies that may compete with ours. In addition, our ADC collaborators may develop compounds utilizing our technology that may compete with product candidates that we are developing. 
 
We are aware of other companies that have technologies that may be competitive with ours, including Astellas, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, ImmunoGen, Immunomedics, MedImmune, Mersana, and Pfizer, all of which have ADC technology. ImmunoGen has several ADCs in development that may compete with our product candidates. ImmunoGen has also established partnerships with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to allow those other companies to utilize ImmunoGens technology, including Sanofi-Aventis, Genentech, Novartis, Takeda and Lilly. We are also aware of a number of companies developing monoclonal antibodies directed at the same antigen targets or for the treatment of the same diseases as our product candidates. For example, we believe Bristol-Myers Squibb has an anti-CD30 antibody program that may be competitive with ADCETRIS, and Amgen and Xencor have anti-CD19 programs that may be competitive with our product candidates. 
 
In addition, in the United States, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be highly similar or biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved biological product. This pathway allows competitors to reference the FDAs prior approvals regarding innovative biological products and data submitted with a BLA to obtain approval of a biosimilar application 12 years after the time of approval of the innovative biological product. The 12-year exclusivity period runs from the initial approval of the innovator product and not from approval of a new indication. In addition, the 12-year exclusivity period does not prevent another company from independently developing a product that is highly similar to the innovative product, generating all the data necessary for a full BLA and seeking approval. Exclusivity only assures that another company cannot rely on the FDAs prior approvals in approving a BLA for an innovators biological product to support the biosimilar products approval. Further, under the FDAs current interpretation, it is possible that a biosimilar applicant could obtain approval for one or more of the indications approved for the innovator product by extrapolating clinical data from one indication to support approval for other indications. The FDA approved the first biosimilar product in the United States in May 2015. In the European Union, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued since 2005. We are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology and other companies that are actively engaged in research and development of biosimilars or interchangeable products. 
 
31 
 
With respect to our current and potential future product candidates, we believe that our ability to compete effectively and develop products that can be manufactured cost-effectively and marketed successfully will depend on our ability to: 
 

 | advance our technology platforms;
--+----------------------------------


 | license additional technology;
--+-------------------------------


 | complete clinical trials which position our products for regulatory and commercial success;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | maintain a proprietary position in our technologies and products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | obtain required government and other public and private approvals on a timely basis;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | attract and retain key personnel;
--+----------------------------------


 | commercialize effectively;
--+---------------------------


 | obtain reimbursement for our products in approved indications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | comply with applicable laws, regulations and regulatory requirements and restrictions with respect to the commercialization of our products, including with respect to any changed or increased regulatory restrictions; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | enter into additional collaborations to advance the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing 
 
We do not currently have the internal ability to manufacture the drug products that we sell or need to conduct our clinical trials, and we therefore rely on corporate collaborators and contract manufacturing organizations to supply drug product for commercial supply and our IND-enabling studies and clinical trials. For the monoclonal antibody used in ADCETRIS, we have contracted with AbbVie for clinical and commercial supplies. For the drug linker used in ADCETRIS, we have contracted with Sigma Aldrich Fine Chemicals, or SAFC, for clinical and commercial supplies. We have multiple contract manufacturers for conjugating the drug linker to the antibody and producing the ADCETRIS product. For our ADC product candidates, multiple contract manufacturers, including AbbVie and SAFC, perform antibody and drug-linker manufacturing and several other contract manufacturers perform conjugation of the drug-linker to the antibody and fill/finish of the drug product. In addition, we rely on other third parties to perform additional steps in the manufacturing process, including shipping and storage of ADCETRIS and our product candidates. 
 
We established our commercial scale supply chain for ADCETRIS prior to commercial launch. For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers and other third parties to produce, vial and store sufficient quantities of ADCETRIS for use in our clinical trials and for commercial sale. In addition, we depend on outside vendors for the supply of raw materials used to produce ADCETRIS. For our pipeline programs, we believe that our existing supplies of drug product and our contract manufacturing relationships will be sufficient to accommodate clinical trials through phase 3. However, we may need to obtain additional manufacturing arrangements or increase our own manufacturing capability to meet our future commercial needs, both of which could require significant capital investment. In addition, we have committed to provide Takeda with their needs of certain parts of the ADCETRIS supply chain for a limited period of time, which may require us to arrange for additional manufacturing supply. We may also enter into collaborations with pharmaceutical or larger biotechnology companies to enhance the manufacturing capabilities for our product candidates. 
 
AbbVie Biotechnology.     In February 2004, we entered into a development and supply agreement with AbbVie (formerly a part of Abbott Laboratories) to manufacture developmental, clinical and commercial quantities of anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody, which is a component of ADCETRIS. The agreement generally 
 
32 
 
 provides for the supply by AbbVie and the purchase by us of such anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody. Under terms of the supply agreement, we may purchase a portion of our required anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody from a second source third-party supplier. We are required to make a minimum annual purchase. The anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody is purchased by us based upon a rolling forecast. The supply agreement will continue until 2025 with an automatic one-year term extension unless either party provides written termination notice to the other party. Either party has the right to terminate the supply agreement if the other party materially breaches its obligations thereunder. 
 
SAFC.     In December 2010, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with SAFC to manufacture commercial quantities of drug linker that is a component of ADCETRIS. The agreement generally provides for the supply by SAFC and the purchase by us of drug linker. Under terms of the supply agreement, we may purchase a portion of our required drug linker from a second source third-party supplier. We are required to make a minimum annual purchase. The drug linker is purchased by us based upon a rolling forecast. The supply agreement was made effective as of December 1, 2010 and will continue until the completion of the tenth contract year following the initial commercial order with automatic term extension unless either party provides written termination notice to the other party. Either party has the right to terminate the supply agreement if the other party materially breaches its obligations thereunder. 
 
Commercial Operations and Information About Geographic Areas 
 
We have allocated commercial resources, including sales, marketing, supply chain management and reimbursement capabilities, to commercialize ADCETRIS in the United States and Canada. We believe the U.S. and Canadian markets for ADCETRIS in the approved indications are addressable with a targeted sales and marketing organization, and we intend to continue promoting ADCETRIS ourselves in the United States and Canada for these and any additional indications we may obtain in the future. Takeda has commercial rights in the rest of the world. ADCETRIS was granted conditional marketing authorization in the European Union in October 2012 for patients with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma or relapsed sALCL. As of January 31, 2017, we and Takeda had received marketing authorizations by regulatory authorities in 66 countries, and Takeda continues to pursue marketing authorizations in multiple other countries. 
 
We sell ADCETRIS through a limited number of pharmaceutical distributors. Health care providers order ADCETRIS through these distributors. We receive orders from distributors and generally ship product directly to the health care provider. Three of our major distributors, together with entities under their common controlAmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and McKesson Corporationeach accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our net product sales of ADCETRIS for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, were $265.8 million, $226.1 million, and $178.2 million, respectively. Revenues generated outside the United States as determined by customer location were less than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. Substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the United States. 
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 890 employees. Of these employees, 634 were engaged in or support research, development and clinical activities, 140 were in administrative and business related positions, and 116 were in sales and marketing. Each of our employees has signed confidentiality and inventions assignment agreements and none are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced employment-related work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
