Item 1. | Business.

General
 
Industrial Services of America, Inc. (herein “ISA,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or other similar terms) is a Louisville, Kentucky-based company that buys, processes and markets ferrous and non-ferrous metals and other recyclable commodities and buys used autos in order to sell used auto parts. Through our Recycling Segment, we purchase, process and sell ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal to steel mini-mills, integrated steel makers, foundries and refineries. We purchase ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal primarily from industrial and commercial generators of steel, iron, aluminum, copper, stainless steel and other metals as well as from scrap dealers and retail customers who deliver these materials directly to our facilities. We process scrap metal through our sorting, cutting, baling, and until May 2015, our shredding operations. Our non-ferrous scrap recycling operations consist primarily of collecting, sorting and processing various grades of copper, aluminum, stainless steel and brass. Our used automobile yard primarily purchases automobiles so that retail customers can locate and remove used parts for purchase.
 
Before December 4, 2015, we were also a provider of waste services through our Waste Services Segment. On December 4, 2015, the Company sold substantially all assets of its Waste Services Segment. The Waste Services Segment provided waste management services including contract negotiations with service providers, centralized billing, invoice auditing and centralized dispatching. This segment also rented, leased, sold and serviced waste handling and recycling equipment, such as trash compactors and balers, to end-use customers. The Waste Services Segment has been classified as discontinued operations in this Form 10-K in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 205-20-55. Results of discontinued operations are excluded from the consolidated financial information for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted. See Note 15 - Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 Our core business is now focused on the metal recycling industry. During 2016, we announced that the Company formed a special committee of independent board members to evaluate various growth and strategic options.  During the first quarter of 2017, the special committee concluded its work and reported to the Board. The Board accepted the special committee's recommendation to focus on returning our core recycling business to profitability. We intend to do this by increasing efficiencies and productivity while evaluating various options which may include operating the Company's auto shredder. We will also remain alert for possible strategic partnerships, joint ventures and mergers/acquisitions. On March 31, 2017, the Company amended the terms of its credit facility with MidCap Business Credit, LLC ("MidCap") to extend the maturity date of the Company's line of credit and increase the line of credit from $6.0 million to $8.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain borrowing base restrictions as more fully described in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 3 - Long Term Debt and Notes Payable to Bank in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
The Company also announced on October 4, 2016 the Company and Algar mutually agreed to terminate the Management Agreement between us, pursuant to the Agreement to Terminate Management Services among the Company, Algar, and Sean Garber dated as of September 30, 2016.  Effective September 30, 2016, Mr. Garber resigned from all positions with the Company, including as President. Also, on September 30, 2016, the company’s Chief Financial Officer was appointed to serve in the additional role as President. 
 
Additional financial information about our segments can be found in Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Our Response to 2015 and 2016 Commodity Markets and Liquidity Conditions 
 
 During 2015, the Company's average selling price per unit of quantity decreased by 49.4% and 24.9% for ferrous and nonferrous material, respectively, compared to 2014. These decreases also led to significantly lower volumes of material available to the Company to buy and sell. Due to these deteriorating metals commodity market conditions, ISA took significant steps to improve liquidity and pay down debt during 2015 and 2016. Despite modest improvements in metal commodity markets during 2016, low prices combined with low volumes present a difficult ongoing metals recycling market. These steps are described below.

 On February 27, 2015, the Company closed on the sale of its Seymour, Indiana property. Also, in conjunction with this decision, the Company signed a lease, effective December 1, 2014, to lease a facility in the Seymour area.  See Note 4 - Lease Commitments and Note 10 - Related Party Transactions in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further lease information. Proceeds were used to reduce debt and improve liquidity.
 
 On April 30, 2015, LK Property Investments, LLC ("LK Property"), an entity principally owned by Daniel M. Rifkin, CEO of MetalX LLC ("MetalX"), (a related party) a scrap metal recycling company headquartered in Waterloo, Indiana, and the principal owner of Recycling Capital Partners, LLC ("RCP") (a related party) purchased a 4.4 acre parcel of real estate located at 6709 Grade Lane, Louisville, KY from ISA Real Estate LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company for a purchase price of $1.0 million. The Company realized a loss of $102.0 thousand from this sale. Also on April 30, 2015, the Company entered into a lease agreement with LK Property for a portion of the 4.4 acre parcel. See Note 4 - Lease Commitments in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further lease details. Proceeds were used to reduce debt and improve liquidity.
 
 On May 13, 2015, the Company announced the warm idle of the Company’s auto shredder. This action was in response to market conditions, primarily related to ferrous price volatility and lower ferrous volumes. Management will continue to monitor and analyze market conditions and to review the Company’s long-term options for its shredder and related downstream processing operation. The costs of idling were recognized in the 2015 financial statements. As a result of the continued operating losses from the shredder operations, management reviewed the carrying cost of the shredder, including the downstream processing system. The Company recognized an asset impairment charge of approximately $636.6 thousand related to the shredder’s downstream processing system. This charge was recorded in 2015 as an impairment charge on property and equipment within the cost of goods section in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. As of the date of this report, the shredder remains idled. The Company continues to depreciate the assets associated with the shredder. Working capital, which would otherwise have been utilized in operating the shredder, was used to reduce debt and improve liquidity.
 
 In May 2015, ISA Real Estate, LLC sold to SG&D Ventures, LLC ("SG&D"), an entity owned by shareholders of Algar, Inc. ("Algar"), including Sean Garber, at that time the Company’s Vice Chairman of the Board and President, and the President of Algar, an approximately 1-acre parcel of non-essential real estate, located at 7017 Grade Lane, Louisville, KY, for an aggregate purchase price equal to independent third-party appraisal amount of $350.0 thousand. The purchase consideration consisted of $300.0 thousand in cash from the purchaser and a credit of $50.0 thousand against bonus compensation previously accrued but not paid to Algar as described in  Note 10 - Related Party Transactions in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The gain on sale of this asset was $1.1 thousand and was recognized during the second quarter of 2015. Proceeds were used to reduce debt and improve liquidity.
 
 On November 6, 2015, the Company entered into a Forbearance Agreement and Third Amendment to Credit Agreement (the “Forbearance Agreement”) by and among the Company, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo"). The Forbearance Agreement amended the Credit Agreement to reduce the Maximum Revolver Amount from $15.0 million to $5.0 million. The Forbearance Agreement also amended the Credit Agreement Maturity Date to March 15, 2016 from June 13, 2019. The Forbearance Agreement increased the interest rate on the outstanding indebtedness by approximately 100 basis points.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Forbearance Agreement, Wells Fargo agreed that it would forbear, until the Forbearance Termination Date (as defined below), from exercising certain rights and remedies with respect to or arising out of the existence and continuation of certain stipulated events of default under the Credit Agreement between the loan parties and Wells Fargo (as amended by the First Amendment to Credit Agreement dated January 15, 2015, the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement dated January 22, 2015, and the Forbearance Agreement, the “Credit Agreement”).
 
Under the Forbearance Agreement, the Forbearance Termination Date was the earlier to occur of (i) Wells Fargo’s election following the failure of the Loan Parties to satisfy any of the Forbearance Conditions, and (ii) March 15, 2016. 
 
 On December 4, 2015, the Company and WESSCO, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of ISA ("WESSCO"), entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") with Compactor Rentals of America, LLC ("Compactor Rentals") pursuant to which the Company sold its “Waste Services Segment,” consisting of substantially all of the assets used in (i) the Company’s commercial, retail and industrial waste and recycling management services business which the Company operated under the name “Computerized Waste Systems” or “CWS,” and (ii) the Company’s equipment sales, rental and maintenance business for the commercial and industrial waste and recycling industry which the Company operated under the name “Waste Equipment Sales and Service Company".
 
 
The Company received cash consideration at closing of $7.5 million, less $150.0 thousand retained by Compactor Rentals (the "Holdback"). In connection with the closing of the transaction, the Company entered into a transition services agreement with Compactor Rentals, pursuant to which the Company will provide certain services to Compactor Rentals until March 31, 2017.
 
On April 1, 2016, the Company entered Amendment No. 1 to the Asset Purchase Agreement which extended the deadline for the Company to provide written notice if the Company objected to Compactor Rental’s calculation of the Holdback. On April 15, 2016, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Asset Purchase Agreement whereby the Company and Compactor Rentals agreed that the Holdback would be retained by Compactor Rentals based on a mutually-agreed upon calculation of working capital. Amendment No. 2 also detailed the parties’ agreement of the following: no indemnification claims would be made by Compactor Rentals arising out of certain matters; certain Compactor Rentals’ representatives did not have knowledge of any additional indemnification claims as of April 15, 2016; and the transition services agreement between the parties would be extended at no cost to Compactor Rentals through March 31, 2017.
 
Compactor Rentals assumed certain liabilities relating to the Waste Services Segment, including but not limited to, current liabilities, warranty liabilities, and post-closing liabilities incurred in connection with transferred contracts.
 
The sale included substantially all of the assets of the Waste Services Segment including, but not limited to, current assets, accounts receivable, tangible personal property, certain leases, inventory, intellectual property, rights under transferred contracts, rights of action and all associated goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the transferred assets.
 
The Asset Purchase Agreement contains a restrictive covenant under which the Company is prohibited from competing with the Waste Services Segment for five years following the closing.

The Company used the proceeds from the transaction to pay transaction expenses, to repay in full the Company’s outstanding indebtedness with Bank of Kentucky, Inc., ("KY Bank") and to repay in full ISA’s term loan from Wells Fargo. The Company also used the proceeds to pay all outstanding amounts on ISA’s $5.0 million revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo which remained available following the closing.
 
 On February 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement (the "2016 Loan") with MidCap. The 2016 Loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. Proceeds from this loan were used to pay transaction expenses and to pay off and close the remaining balance on the Wells Fargo revolving line of credit. 
 
 On March 31, 2017, the Company and each of its wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into an amendment to the 2016 Loan with MidCap ("First Amendment"). The First Amendment increased this line of credit from $6.0 million to $8.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain borrowing base restrictions and extended the maturity date to February 28, 2020. 
 
Following the MidCap transaction and the First Amendment, the Company believes its liquidity is sufficient to meet projected needs for at least one year. See Note 3 - Long Term Debt and Notes Payable To Bank in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
 
 ISA Recycling Operating Division
 
Our Recycling Segment sells processed ferrous and non-ferrous scrap material, including stainless steel, to end-users such as steel mini-mills, integrated steel makers and foundries and refineries. We purchase ferrous and non-ferrous scrap material primarily from industrial and commercial generators of steel, iron, aluminum, copper, stainless steel and other metals as well as from other scrap dealers who deliver these materials directly to our facilities. We process these materials by sorting, cutting and/or baling. Prior to May 2015, we also shredded material.
 
We also operate the ISA Pick.Pull.Save used automobile parts yard, which is considered a product line within the Recycling Segment. We purchase automobiles for the yard through auctions, automobile purchase programs with various suppliers and general scrap purchases. Retail customers locate and remove used parts for purchase from automobiles within the yard. Fuel, Freon, tires and certain core automobile parts are also sold to various resellers for additional revenue. All automobiles are sold as scrap metal after a specified time period in the yard. 
 
Ferrous Operations
 
Ferrous Scrap Purchasing - We purchase ferrous scrap from two primary sources: (i) industrial and commercial generators of steel and iron; and (ii) scrap dealers, peddlers, and other generators and collectors who sell us steel and iron scrap, known as obsolete scrap. Market demand and the composition, quality, size and weight of the materials are the primary factors that determine prices paid to these material providers.
 
Ferrous Scrap Processing - We prepare ferrous scrap material for resale through a variety of methods including sorting, cutting, and baling. Prior to May 2015, we also shredded material. We produce a number of differently sized, shaped and graded products depending upon customer specifications and market demand.
 
 
• | Sorting - After purchasing ferrous scrap material, we inspect it to determine how we should process it to maximize profitability. In some instances, we may sort scrap material and sell it without further processing. We separate scrap material for further processing according to its size, composition and grade by using conveyor systems, front-end loaders, crane-mounted electromagnets and claw-like grapples.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cutting - Pieces of over-sized ferrous scrap material, such as obsolete steel girders and used pipe, which are too large for other processing, are cut with hand torches.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Baling - We process light-gauge ferrous materials such as clips, sheet iron and by-products from industrial and commercial processes, such as stampings, clippings and excess trimmings, by baling these materials into large, uniform blocks. We use cranes and conveyors to feed the material into a hydraulic press, which compresses the material into uniform blocks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Shredding - In May 2015, we warm idled our shredder. Prior to this date, we shredded large pieces of ferrous scrap material, such as automobiles and major appliances, in our shredder by hammer mill action into pieces of a workable size that pass through magnetic separators to separate metal from synthetic foam, fabric, rubber, stone, dirt, etc. The metal we recovered from the shredding process was sold directly to customers or reused in some other metal blend. The residue by-product is usually referred to as “automobile shredder residue” (ASR) or “shredder fluff”. We disposed of the non-metal components, which can reduce the volume of the scrap as much as 25.0%, in a landfill.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Ferrous Scrap Sales - We sell processed ferrous scrap material to end-users such as steel mini-mills, integrated steel makers and foundries, and brokers who aggregate materials for other large users. Most customers purchase processed ferrous scrap material through negotiated spot sales contracts, which establish the quantity purchased for the month and the pricing. The price we charge for ferrous scrap materials depends upon market supply and demand, as well as quality and grade of the scrap material. We deliver scrap ourselves or use third party carriers via truck, rail car, and/or barge. Some customers choose to send their own delivery trucks. These trucks are weighed and loaded at one of our sites based on the sales order.
 
Auto Parts Operations
 
We operate a single self-service retail parts location. We generate revenue from the sale of parts, cores and scrap. Our location consists of an indoor retail facility combined with a fenced outdoor storage area for autos. We operate our self-service auto parts business under the name of ISA Pick.Pull.Save.
 
Non-Ferrous Operations
 
Non-Ferrous Scrap Purchasing - We purchase non-ferrous scrap from two primary sources: (i) industrial and commercial non-ferrous scrap material providers who generate or sell waste aluminum, copper, stainless steel, other nickel-bearing metals, brass and other metals; and (ii) peddlers, scrap dealers, generators and collectors who deliver directly to our facilities material that they collect from a variety of sources. We also collect non-ferrous scrap from sources other than those that are delivered directly to our processing facilities by placing retrieval boxes at these sources. We subsequently transport the boxes to our processing facilities.
 
Non-Ferrous Scrap Processing - We prepare non-ferrous scrap metals, principally aluminum, copper, brass and stainless steel to sell by sorting, cutting, and baling. Prior to May 2015, we also shredded material.
 

• | Sorting - Our sorting operations separate and identify non-ferrous scrap by using front-end loaders, grinders, hand torches and spectrometers. Our ability to identify metallurgical composition maximizes margins and profitability. We sort non-ferrous scrap material for further processing according to type, grade, size and chemical composition. Throughout the sorting process, we determine whether the material requires further processing before we sell it.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cutting - Pieces of over-sized non-ferrous scrap material, which are too large for other processing methods, are cut with hand torches.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Baling - We process non-ferrous metals such as aluminum cans, sheet and siding by baling these materials into large uniform blocks. We use front-end loaders and conveyors to feed the material into a hydraulic press, which compresses the material into uniform blocks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Shredding - In May 2015, we warm idled our shredder. Prior to this date, we shredded large pieces of nonferrous scrap material, such as steel drums, copper and aluminum cable, tubing, sheet metal, extrusions, and baled aluminum, in our shredder by hammer mill action into pieces of a workable size that pass through magnetic separators to separate metal from synthetic foam, fabric, rubber, stone, dirt, etc. The metal we recovered from the shredding process was sold directly to customers or reused in some other metal blend. We disposed of the non-metal components, which can reduce the volume of the scrap as much as 25.0%, in a landfill.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Non-Ferrous Scrap Sales - We sell processed non-ferrous scrap material to end-users such as foundries, aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers, copper refineries and smelters, steel mini-mills, integrated steel makers, steel foundries and refineries, and brass and bronze ingot manufacturers. Prices for the majority of non-ferrous scrap materials change based upon the daily publication of spot and futures prices on COMEX or the London Metals Exchange. We deliver scrap ourselves or use third party carriers via truck, rail car, and/or barge. Some customers choose to send their own delivery trucks. These trucks are weighed and loaded at one of our sites based on the sales order.
 
Waste Services Operations (Discontinued Operations)
 
On December 4, 2015, we sold substantially all assets of our Waste Services Segment. Our waste services operations were in the business of commercial, retail and industrial waste and recycling management services (operating under the name “Computerized Waste Systems” or “CWS”) and commercial and industrial waste and recycling handling equipment sales, rental and maintenance (operating under the name “Waste Equipment Sales and Service Company” or “WESSCO”). 
Company Background
 
ISA was incorporated in 1953 in Florida under the name ALSON MFG. CO. and originally designed and manufactured various forms of electrical products.
 
In 1984, ISA moved into waste handling and disposal equipment sales. 
 
In 1985, we began offering solid waste management consultations. 
 
We began focusing on ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal recycling in 1997 and expanded into the stainless steel and high-temperature alloys recycling business in 2009. 
 
 
In 2012, we opened the ISA Pick.Pull.Save used automobile yard.
 
In 2013, we discontinued blending stainless steel, which is a subset of the stainless steel market. 
 
In 2015, as previously discussed, we exited the waste services business and idled our shredder.
 
As of 2016, our primary focus is ferrous and non-ferrous metal recycling, as well as selling used auto parts.
 
Competition
 
The metal recycling business is highly competitive and is subject to significant changes in economic and market conditions. In late 2014 and early 2015, the metal commodity market saw increased volatility. Market prices traded down significantly lower, particularly during 2015. The metal commodity market experienced continued volatility during 2016. The 2016 metal commodity market finished strong and provided a positive outlook for 2017. Given the strengthening dollar, exports were reduced and steel mills were able to buy large quantities of low-cost scrap. Pricing and proximity to a metal source are the major competitive factors in the metal recycling business. We compete for the purchase and sale of scrap metal with large, well-financed recyclers of scrap metal as well as smaller metal facilities and brokers/dealers. Although we expanded our facilities and increased our processing efficiencies in prior years, certain of our competitors have greater financial, marketing and physical resources. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain our desired market share based on the competitive nature of this industry.
Dependence on Major Customer
 
In 2016, we had sales to one major customer that totaled approximately 12.5% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
 
Employees
 
As of March 26, 2017, we had 75 full-time employees. None of our employees are members of a union.
 
Effect of State and Federal Environmental Regulations
 
Although we believe that our business model adequately protects us from potential environmental liability, we also continue to use our best efforts to be in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws. Such compliance has not historically constituted a material expense to us.
 
The recycling operations are subject to federal, state and local requirements, which regulate health, safety, the environment, zoning and land-use. We strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While such amounts expended in the past or that we anticipate spending in the future have not had and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations, the possibility remains that technological, regulatory or enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies or other factors could materially alter this expectation.
