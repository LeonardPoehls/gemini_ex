Overview
PBFX is a fee-based, growth-oriented, Delaware master limited partnership formed in February 2013 by subsidiaries of PBF Energy Inc. and its indirect subsidiary, PBF Logistics GP LLC (“PBF GP”), our general partner, to own or lease, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets. PBF GP is our general partner and is wholly-owned by PBF Energy Company LLC (“PBF LLC”). PBF Energy Inc. is the sole managing member of PBF LLC and as of December 31, 2016 owned 96.5% of the total economic interest in PBF LLC. We refer you to “Organizational Structure” below for an illustration of our relationship with PBF Energy Inc. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to “PBF Energy” refer collectively to PBF Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries, other than PBFX and its subsidiaries, and our general partner. On May 14, 2014, PBFX completed its initial public offering of 15,812,500 common units (including 2,062,500 common units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option) (the “Offering”). PBFX filed a registration statement on Form S-1, with respect to the Offering, with the SEC which was declared effective on May 8, 2014. On May 9, 2014, PBFX’s common units began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “PBFX.” As of December 31, 2016, PBF LLC held a 44.2% limited partner interest in PBFX, a non-economic general partner interest and owns all of PBFX’s incentive distribution rights (“IDRs”), with the remaining 55.8% limited partner interest held by public unitholders.

The Partnership includes the assets, liabilities and results of operations of certain crude oil and refined product terminaling, pipeline and storage assets, previously operated and owned by subsidiaries of PBF Holding Company LLC (“PBF Holding”), Delaware City Refining Company LLC (“DCR”), Toledo Refining Company LLC (“TRC”) and PBF Holding’s previously held subsidiaries, Delaware Pipeline Company LLC (“DPC”) and Torrance Valley Pipeline Company LLC (“TVPC”), which were acquired in a series of transactions.
Acquisitions in 2016
On April 29, 2016, the Partnership’s wholly-owned subsidiary, PBF Logistics Products Terminals LLC (“PLPT”), purchased four refined product terminals located in and around Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the “East Coast Terminals”) from an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (the “Plains Asset Purchase”). PBFX accounted for the Plains Asset Purchase as a business combination under accounting principles generally accepted 
3

in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) whereby the Partnership recognizes assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition.
On August 31, 2016, the Partnership, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, PBFX Operating Company LLC (“PBFX Op Co”), acquired from PBF LLC a 50% equity interest in TVPC, which owns the 189-mile San Joaquin Valley Pipeline system with capacity of approximately 110,000 barrels per day (“bpd”) (the “Torrance Valley Pipeline”), which supports PBF Holding’s Torrance Refinery (the “TVPC Acquisition”). The Torrance Valley Pipeline consists of the M55, M1 and M70 pipeline systems, including 11 pipeline stations with storage capacity and truck unloading capability at two of the stations. The transactions entered into with PBF LLC after the Offering, including those consummated prior to 2016, are collectively referred to as the “Acquisitions from PBF.” The Acquisitions from PBF were transfers between entities under common control. Accordingly, the financial information of the Predecessor (as defined below) and the Partnership contained herein have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of the Acquisitions from PBF for all periods presented prior to the effective date of each transaction. 
Equity Offerings in 2016
On April 5, 2016, we completed a public offering of an aggregate of 2,875,000 common units, including 375,000 common units that were sold pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriter of its option to purchase additional common units, for net proceeds of approximately $51.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses (the “April 2016 Offering”). 
On August 17, 2016, PBFX completed a public offering of an aggregate of 4,000,000 common units, with an underwriter’s option to purchase an additional 600,000 common units, of which 375,000 units were subsequently purchased on September 14, 2016, for a total of 4,375,000 shares and total net proceeds of approximately $86.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses (the “August 2016 Offering”). A portion of the proceeds from the August 2016 Offering were used to fund the TVPC Acquisition. 
Principles of Combination and Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The financial statements presented in this Form 10-K include the consolidated financial results of the PBF MLP Predecessor, our predecessor for accounting purposes (our “Predecessor”), for periods presented through May 13, 2014, and the consolidated financial results of PBFX for the period beginning May 14, 2014, the date of the Offering. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 presents solely the consolidated financial position of PBFX. We recorded the Acquisitions from PBF at PBF Energy’s historical book value, as the Acquisitions from PBF were treated as a reorganization of entities under common control. We have retrospectively adjusted the financial information of our Predecessor and PBFX contained herein to include the historical results of the DCR West Rack, Toledo Storage Facility, the Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck Rack (all as defined below) and the Torrance Valley Pipeline prior to the effective date of each transaction. 
Our Predecessor did not historically operate its assets for the purpose of generating revenues independent of other PBF Energy businesses that we support, with the exception of the Delaware City Products Pipeline. In connection with the closing of the Offering and each of the Acquisitions from PBF, we entered into commercial and service agreements with subsidiaries of PBF Energy under which we operate our assets for the purpose of generating fee-based revenues. We receive, handle and transfer crude oil and refined products from sources located throughout the United States and Canada and store crude oil, refined products and intermediates for PBF Energy in support of its refineries located in Toledo, Ohio, Delaware City, Delaware, Paulsboro, New Jersey and Torrance, California. 
Since we do not own any of the crude oil or refined products that we handle nor engage in the trading of crude oil or refined products, we have minimal direct exposure to risks associated with commodity price fluctuations. However, these risks indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long-term through their 
4

effects on our customer’s operations. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from PBF Energy under various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements that generally include minimum volume commitments (“MVCs”).
The Partnership is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes or the income taxes of those states that follow the federal income tax treatment of partnerships. Instead, for purposes of these income taxes, each partner of the Partnership is required to take into account his, her or its share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction in computing his, her or its federal and state income tax liabilities, regardless of whether cash distributions are made to such partner by the Partnership. The taxable income reportable to each partner takes into account differences between the tax basis and fair market value of PBFX’s assets, the acquisition price of such partner’s units and the taxable income allocation requirements under the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (our “partnership agreement”).
Recent Developments 
Contribution Agreement
On February 15, 2017, we entered into a contribution agreement with PBF LLC pursuant to which PBF LLC has agreed to contribute to us all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline Company LLC (“PNGPC”). The transaction is expected to close on February 28, 2017. PNGPC owns and operates an existing interstate natural gas pipeline that originates in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, and terminates at the delivery point to PBF Holdings Paulsboro Refinery. PNGPC has Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) approval for, and is in the process of constructing, a new 24” pipeline (the “New Pipeline”) to replace the existing pipeline, which will be abandoned. In consideration for the PNGPC limited liability company interests, at closing, we will deliver (i) an intercompany promissory note in an amount to be determined based on the amounts expended through the closing date with respect to the New Pipeline and the abandonment of the existing line, (ii) an expansion rights and right of first refusal agreement in favor of PBF LLC with respect to the New Pipeline and (iii) an assignment and assumption agreement with respect to certain outstanding litigation involving PNGPC and the existing pipeline.
Storage Services Agreement 
On February 15, 2017, our wholly-owned subsidiary, PBFX Op Co and PBF Holding entered into a ten-year storage services agreement (the “Chalmette Storage Agreement”) under which we, through PBFX Op Co, will provide storage services to PBF Holding commencing upon the earlier of November 1, 2017 and the completion of construction of a new tank with a shell capacity of 625,000 barrels at PBF Holding’s Chalmette Refinery. PBFX Op Co and Chalmette Refining, L.L.C. (“Chalmette Refining”) have entered into a twenty-year lease for the premises upon which the tank will be located and a project management agreement pursuant to which Chalmette Refining will manage the construction of the tank. The Chalmette Storage Agreement can be extended by PBF Holding for two additional five-year periods. Under the Chalmette Storage Agreement, we will provide PBF Holding with storage services for a monthly fee of $0.60 per barrel of shell capacity.

The terminaling service agreements have no MVCs and are billed based on actual volumes throughput, other than a terminaling services agreement between the East Coast Terminals' Paulsboro, New Jersey location and PBF Holding with a 15,000 bpd MVC.

Omnibus Agreement 
We entered into an omnibus agreement with PBF GP, PBF LLC and PBF Holding at the closing of the Offering for the provision of executive management services and support for accounting and finance, legal, human resources, information technology, environmental, health and safety, and other administrative functions, as well as i) PBF LLC’s agreement not to compete with us under certain circumstances, subject to certain exceptions, ii) our right of first offer for ten years to acquire certain logistics assets retained by PBF Energy following the Offering, including certain logistics assets that PBF LLC or its subsidiaries may construct or acquire in the future, subject to certain exceptions, and iii) a license to use the PBF Logistics trademark and name.
On August 31, 2016, we entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement (as amended, the “Omnibus Agreement”) in connection with the TVPC Acquisition resulting in an increase to the annual administrative fee to approximately $4.0 million. 
Services Agreement
In connection with the Offering, we entered into an operation and management services and secondment agreement with PBF Holding and certain of its subsidiaries, pursuant to which PBF Holding and its subsidiaries provides PBFX with the personnel necessary for us to perform its obligations under its commercial agreements. We reimburse PBF Holding for the use of such employees and the provision of certain infrastructure-related services to the extent applicable to its operations, including storm water discharge and waste water treatment, steam, potable water, access to certain roads and grounds, sanitary sewer access, electrical power, emergency response, filter press, fuel gas, API solids treatment, fire water and compressed air. 
On August 31, 2016, we entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Services Agreement (as amended, the “Services Agreement”) in connection with the TVPC Acquisition resulting in an increase to the annual fee to approximately $6.4 million. 
The Services Agreement will terminate upon the termination of the Omnibus Agreement, provided that we may terminate any service on 30 days’ notice.

Properties
 Our principal properties are described above in “Assets and Operations” under the captions “Transportation and Terminaling Segment” and “Storage Segment.” We believe that our properties and facilities are adequate for our operations and that our facilities are adequately maintained. Our corporate office is located in the same office as PBF Energy. PBF Energy leases approximately 58,000 square feet for its principal corporate offices in Parsippany, New Jersey. The lease for PBF Energy’s principal corporate offices expires in 2019. Functions performed in the Parsippany office include overall corporate management, refinery and HSE management, planning and strategy, corporate finance, commercial operations, logistics, contract administration, marketing, investor relations, governmental affairs, accounting, tax, treasury, information technology, legal and human resources support functions. 
Under the Contribution Agreements, PBF Energy, through certain of its subsidiaries, indemnifies us for certain environmental liabilities associated with the ownership and operation of the Contributed Assets and arising at or before the closing of the Offering and the Acquisitions from PBF. See “Environmental Regulations, Environmental Liabilities” below for a more detailed discussion of PBF Energy’s indemnification obligations.
Competition
As a result of our contractual relationship with PBF Energy under our commercial agreements and our direct connection to four of its refineries, we believe that our crude oil, refined product and intermediate unloading terminals, pipelines and storage facility will not face significant competition from other crude oil, refined product and intermediate unloading terminals, pipelines and storage facilities for PBF Energy’s crude oil, refined product and intermediate transportation and storage requirements to those refineries we support with respect to the services provided under our commercial agreements. 
If PBF Energy reduces its purchases of crude oil shipped via rail or truck, PBF Energy may only receive the minimum volumes through our crude oil unloading terminals (or pay the shortfall payment if it does not receive the minimum volumes), which would cause a decrease in our revenues. PBF Energy may elect to ship crude oil to its refineries via pipeline or through its refinery marine facilities as an alternative mode of crude oil transportation. PBF Energy competes with integrated petroleum companies, which have their own crude oil storage, supplies and distribution and marketing systems, as well as with independent refiners, many of which also have their own storage, distribution and marketing systems. PBF Energy also competes with other suppliers that purchase refined petroleum products for resale. Competition in any particular geographic area is affected significantly by the volume of products produced by refineries in that area and by the availability of products and the cost of transportation to that area from distant refineries.
The East Coast Terminals compete with other terminal facilities, in terms of fees, and other qualitative factors, including those affiliated with integrated petroleum companies. Competition related to the East Coast Terminals is affected significantly by the volume of products produced, transported and available in the geographic area and the cost to transport products from distant locations.
Safety and Maintenance
We perform preventive and normal maintenance on all of our facilities and make repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate. We also conduct routine and required inspections of those assets as required by regulation.
Our terminal, pipeline and storage facilities have response plans, spill prevention and control plans, and other programs designed to respond to emergencies. Our East Coast Terminals and Toledo Truck Terminal are protected with fire systems that are actuated either by sensors or an emergency switch. We continually strive to maintain compliance with applicable air, solid waste, and wastewater regulations.
11

Our pipelines are subject to strict safety laws and regulations for the transportation of crude oil and petroleum products. Transportation involves a risk that hazardous liquids may be released into the environment, which could cause harm to the public or the environment. The United States Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and management of pipeline assets, which affect our pipelines. These regulations contain requirements for pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection, testing and maintenance or repairs of the pipelines. The DOT regulations also require pipeline operation and maintenance personnel to meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans. We are in compliance with all of the DOT’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulations on pipeline safety. 
Employee Safety
We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state, and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
Insurance
Terminals and storage facilities may experience damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. We maintain insurance and/or are insured under the property, liability and business interruption policies of PBF Energy and/or certain of its subsidiaries, subject to the deductibles and limits applicable to us, which we believe are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances to cover our operations and assets. However, such insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our assets, and we cannot ensure that such insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage, or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices. As we continue to grow, we will continue to monitor limits and retentions under our policies and those of PBF Energy and/or its subsidiaries as they relate to the overall cost and scope of our insurance program.
Terminal and Pipeline Control Operations
Our East Coast Terminals, Toledo Truck Terminal, Delaware City Truck Terminal and the propane loading facility at our Toledo Storage Facility are generally automated, but continuously supervised by PBF Energy or PBFX employees. Our Delaware City Products Pipeline and Torrance Valley Pipeline are operated by a third-party with oversight by PBF Energy employees. At the terminals, our customers’ truck drivers are provided with security badges or credentials to access and use these facilities. In addition, individual trucks are required to be registered in PBF Energy’s system to ensure that required regulatory inspections are maintained by either PBF Energy’s customers or their common carriers.
Environmental Regulation
Endangered Species Act
The Endangered Species Act restricts certain activities that may affect endangered species or their environments. While some of our facilities are in areas that may be designated as habitats for endangered species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the Endangered Species Act. However, the discovery of 
12

previously unidentified endangered species or habitats could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating limitations or bans in the affected area.
Environmental Liabilities
Contamination resulting from spills of crude oil or petroleum products are not unusual within the petroleum terminaling or transportation industries. Historic spills at truck and rail racks, and terminals as a result of past operations have resulted in contamination of the environment, including soils and groundwater. 
Pursuant to the Contribution Agreements entered into in connection with the Offering and the Acquisitions from PBF, PBF Energy has agreed to indemnify us for certain known and unknown environmental liabilities that are based on conditions in existence at our Predecessor’s properties and associated with the ownership or operation of the Contributed Assets and arising from the conditions that existed prior to the closings of the Offering and the Acquisitions from PBF. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify PBF Energy for (i) certain events and conditions associated with the ownership or operation of our assets that occur, as applicable, after the closing of the each Acquisition from PBF (including the Offering), and (ii) environmental liabilities related to our assets if the environmental liability is the result of the negligence, willful misconduct or criminal conduct of PBF Energy or its employees, including those seconded to us. As a result, we may incur environmental expenses in the future, which may be substantial.
In connection with the Plains Asset Purchase, the Partnership is responsible for the environmental remediation costs for conditions that existed on the closing date up to a maximum of $250,000 per year for ten years, with Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. remaining responsible for any and all additional costs above such amounts during such period. 
As of December 31, 2016, we have recorded a total liability related to environmental remediation costs of $3.6 million related to the Plains Asset Purchase and the TVPC Acquisition. Refer to Note 9 “Commitments and Contingencies” of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
Seasonality
The crude oil and refined products throughput and stored at our facilities are affected by the level of supply and demand for crude oil and refined products in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. However, many effects of seasonality on our revenues will be substantially mitigated due to our commercial agreements with PBF Energy that include MVCs that are constant each calendar quarter. Demand for gasoline is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction work. Decreased demand during the winter months can lower gasoline prices. As a result, our operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters may be lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year. 
Employees
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, PLPT, employs 29 employees that are located at the East Coast Terminals, of which nine are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
