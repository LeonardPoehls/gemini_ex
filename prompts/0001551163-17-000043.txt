Item 1. Business.
History

Protect Pharmaceutical Corporation was originally incorporated in the State of Idaho on August 5, 1987, under the name Interstate Mining and Development Properties, Inc. The Company initially staked certain gold placer mining claims, however the claims did not yield a sufficient amount of ore and the Company halted operations in approximately 1989.

On August 2, 1996, the Company changed its name to Interstate Development, Inc. Also in August 1996, two individuals, H. Deworth Williams and Geoff Williams, acquired controlling interest of the Company’s outstanding common stock through the private purchase of shares from the Company’s two largest shareholders. The Company then engaged in the search for and evaluation of prospective business opportunities with the intent to acquire and/or merge with one or more businesses opportunities.

On July 3, 2006, the Company’s stockholders approved the change of the corporation’s domicile from Idaho to Nevada. On December 14, 2006, the change of domicile to Nevada was finalized by merging with and into Interstate Acquisition, Inc. (incorporated in Nevada on June 15, 2006) for the sole purpose of changing corporate domicile. The Idaho entity was then dissolved and on December 15, 2006, we changed the name of the Nevada entity to Pro-Tect, Inc. and continued to explore possible business opportunities.

On February 12, 2010, we entered into a Patent Acquisition Agreement with Nectid, Inc., a privately held Princeton, New Jersey based company, whereby we acquired from Nectid a portfolio of pending patent applications relating to three drug delivery technologies. Our primary purpose at that time was to develop drug delivery technologies and solutions through innovative dosing and/or delivery that would minimize the pharmaceutical dose, frequency, and side effects. In connection with the acquisition, we changed our corporate name to Protect Pharmaceutical Corporation on April 23, 2010.

In exchange for the acquired patent applications, we issued to Nectid 5.0 million shares of our common stock (pre-split) and agreed to issue an additional 2.0 million shares upon realizing financing of $2.0 million. The acquisition agreement provided certain registration rights whereby the Company would use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, which would include shares issued to Nectid under the agreement. We did not realize the financing nor issued the additional 2 million shares and, accordingly, no registration statement was filed.

In June 2010, we filed a Form 10 registration statement under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result of filing the registration statement, we became obligated to file certain interim and periodic reports, including an annual report containing audited financial statements.

In December 2010, we amended the acquisition agreement to provide that in the event the company sold outright any of the patents acquired from Nectid, without first undertaking any development of the patents, the proceeds from such sale would be divided, 60% to Nectid and 40% to the Protect.

On January 31, 2011, we finalized a Patent Purchase Agreement with Grünenthal GmbH, a company organized under the laws of Germany. Pursuant to the terms of that agreement, Grünenthal purchased all of the company’s rights, title and interest in and to certain inventions described in patents and patent applications. The patents relate to Opioid Formulations and Methods of treating acute and chronic pain.

In exchange for the patents, Grünenthal paid the cash consideration of $1.6 million. Pursuant to our agreement with Nectid, because the patents were sold outright without first undertaking any development of the patents, the proceeds were divided 60% to Nectid and 40% to Protect. Accordingly, the Company realized $640,000 from the sale and the balance was paid to Nectid. We retained all other inventions, patents and technologies initially acquired from Nectid.

On January 24, 2012, Ramesha Sesha tendered his resignation as an officer and director of the Company. He was replaced on February 12, 2012 by Geoff Williams as chief executive officer, president, treasurer and director. Following Mr. Sesha’s resignation, we continued to explore possible development and commercialization of the differentiated products based on our remaining proprietary oral drug delivery technologies and patents acquired from Nectid. Subsequently, management concluded that it would be difficult to continue with this plan without acquiring the necessary qualified scientific personnel. Accordingly, we decided to explore alternative business ventures. 

On September 19, 2014, the Company entered into a Claims Assignment Agreement with Blue Cap Development Corp., a private Nevada corporation (“Blue Cap”), to acquire certain mining and/or mineral claims and/or leases located in Sec. 6, T2S, R1W, New Mexico Principal Meridian, of Soccorro County New Mexico (the “Claims”).

In exchange for the Claims, we issued 26.0 million (pre-split as described below) shares of authorized, but previously unissued common stock. The amount of shares was negotiated between the parties and the 26.0 million shares represented approximately 36.9% of the shares then outstanding following the acquisition. Two principals of Blue Cap, Edward F. Cowle and H. Deworth Williams, are principal stockholders of Protect and owned approximately 31% of Protect’s common stock prior to the acquisition. Because of the related nature of the parties to the transaction, Protect endeavored to conduct an independent investigation of Blue Cap and the Claims and research the merits and value of acquiring the Claims. 

Protect’s past President, Geoff Williams, oversaw the investigation and consulted with outside advisors. Geoff Williams is the son of H. Deworth Williams. The Company researched information and documents related to the Blue Cap Claims and consulted with other persons familiar with the properties and the industry. Following the review of all available information, it was determined that the acquisition of the Claims presented a unique opportunity for the company. Management believes that the acquisition was accomplished for a fair, negotiated consideration and the acquisition is in the best interest of our stockholders.

Our decision to enter into the Claims Acquisition Agreement was premised on the Board of Directors intention to diversify the Company’s future business. As a result of acquiring the Claims, we are developing a plan to commence an exploration program for the possibility of deposits of rare earth elements on the Claims. Rare earth elements are essential for a diverse and expanding array of high-technology applications and for many current and emerging alternative energy technologies, such as electric vehicles, energy-efficient lighting, and wind power. Examples of products that use rare earth elements are computer hard drives, smart phones, TV screens and wind turbines. Rare earth elements are also critical for a number of key defense systems such as lasers, radar, missile-guidance systems and other electronics. 

Management anticipates that the Company will need to secure adequate funding to develop and implement an exploration program. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the necessary funding to fulfill our goals, or that any future funding will be available on terms favorable to the Company, or at all.

Our 10 lode mining claims are located in Sec. 6, T2S, R1W, New Mexico Principal Meridian, of Soccorro County, New Mexico. The Claims are being held for the purpose of exploration for gold, silver and rare earth mineralization deposits and are located near existing exploration projects and we expect will be explored by other mining companies. Extensive exploration will be required before we can make a final evaluation as to the economic and legal feasibility of any potential deposit. According to SEC Industry Guide No. 7, we are classified or considered an exploration stage mining company. This is defined as a company engaged in the search for mineral deposits or reserves of precious and base metal targets, which are not in either the development or production stage.

On September 9, 2016, effective September 9, 2016, Deworth Williams, the principal stockholder of the Company (“Williams”), entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”), as amended (the “Amended Agreement”), dated, August 30, 2016, with Taylor Group Holdings, LLC (the “Buyer”), a Florida Limited Liability Company, pursuant to which, among other things, Williams agreed to sell to the Buyer, and the Buyer agreed to purchase from Williams, a total of 937,063 shares of Common Stock owned of record and beneficially by Williams (the “Purchased Shares”). The Purchased Shares represented approximately 84.3% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date. In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the Board appointed Una Taylor and Theodore Faison to fill vacancies on the Company’s Board of Directors.

On September 20, 2016, we announced that Protect Pharmaceutical intended to acquire DreamFU Ventures LLC a Florida LLC in a transaction that will result in the DreamFu entity becoming the operating entity in our public company (“Merger”) and that will also result in Protect Pharmaceutical acquiring 100% of the issued and outstanding equity of DreamFu Ventures LLC.  During the fourth quarter, we abandoned this transaction. 

We currently have limited capital and no revenues. Management anticipates that in the near term, ongoing expenses, including the costs associated with the preparation and filing with the SEC of requisite reports, will be paid for by advances from stockholders or from the private sale of securities, either debt or equity.  However, there is no assurance that we will be able to realize such funds on terms favorable to us, or at all.

Our principal offices are currently located at 95 Merrick Way, Third Floor, Coral Gables, Florida 33143
 and our telephone number is (954) 292-0033.
 
Reverse Stock Split

On November 4, 2014, Protect effected a reverse stock split of its 70,513,012 million issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a one (1) share for one thousand (1000) shares basis. As per the terms of the reverse stock split, any fractional share amount resulting from the split was automatically rounded up to the next higher whole share amount, with the provision that no individual stockholder’s holdings would be reduced below 100 shares. Accordingly, additional shares to restore each such affected stockholder’s holdings to 100 shares were issued. The par value of the common stock remains at $0.005 per share. All subsequent references to the number of shares will be on a post-split basis unless otherwise noted. As a result of the reverse stock split and the rounding up of odd lots to 100 shares, as of the date of this report we have issued and outstanding approximately 1,111,460 shares of common stock.

Each share certificate representing shares of pre-split common stock is deemed to represent one-thousandth (1/1000) shares of post-split common stock. Certificates representing post-split common stock will be issued in due course as old share certificates are tendered for exchange or transfer to the Company’s transfer agent.

Business Development Strategies

We reviewed the Company’s remaining patents and new generation drug delivery technologies acquired in 2010. However, without personnel with the requisite scientific expertise, management feels it will be difficult to further develop the technologies. Accordingly, our primary business focus has shifted to the exploration of the acquired properties to determine whether there is commercial potential.

In order to facilitate an exploration program, we will need to raise adequate funds to complete initial exploration commitments and pay general business and operating expenses. We estimate that we will need up to $100,000 during the next twelve months to complete the initial phase of exploration and to commence an exploration program on our properties. Management plans to explore a possible private placement of our securities and/or debt financing to raise the additional fund, although no definitive plan has been formulated and there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the necessary funds.

If we are able to complete our initial exploration programs and successfully identify a mineral deposit, we will need substantial additional funds for drilling and engineering studies to determine whether any identified mineral deposit is commercially viable. If we are unable to raise additional funds for this work or secure a strategic partner, we would be unable to proceed, even if a mineral deposit is discovered and is believed to be commercially viable.

Historically, we have incurred operating losses and we will not be able to exist indefinitely without securing additional operating funds. In the view of our independent auditors, we will require additional funds to maintain operations and these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

We anticipate that our immediate funding requirements will have to be satisfied by advances from officers, directors or stockholders. We will most likely accrue expenses when possible until a funding can be accomplished. Management intends to hold expenses to a minimum and to obtain services on a contingency basis when possible. Further, we expect directors to defer any compensation until such time as we have sufficient funds. We have not yet entered into any arrangements or definitive agreements to use outside advisors or consultants or to raise any capital. 

As it is most likely we will need to obtain outside financing, possibly the only method available would be the private sale of securities. It is unlikely that we could make a public sale of securities or be able to borrow any significant sum from either a commercial or private lender. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary additional funding when and if needed, or that such funding, if available, can be obtained on acceptable terms.

Current Status

The Company’s current business plan is to contemplate a possible future merger by the Company and either an affiliated entity or an as yet unknown other entity.

The Company’s common stock is currently quoted on the QB tier of the OTC Markets under the ticker symbol “PRTT”.

The Company may be referred to as a reporting shell corporation. Shell corporations have zero or nominal assets and typically no stated or contingent liabilities.  Private companies wishing to become publicly trading may wish to merge with a shell (a reverse merger or reverse acquisition) whereby the shareholders of the private company become the majority of the shareholders of the combined company.  The private company may purchase for cash all or a portion of the common shares of the shell corporation from its major stockholders.  Typically, the Board and officers of the private company become the new Board and officers of the combined Company and often the name of the private company becomes the name of the combined entity. 
 
The Company has very limited capital, and it is unlikely that the Company will be able to take advantage of more than one such business opportunity.  The Company intends to seek opportunities demonstrating the potential of long-term growth as opposed to short-term earnings. However, at the present time, the Company has not identified any business opportunity that it plans to pursue, nor has the Company reached any agreement or definitive understanding with any person concerning an acquisition.

It is anticipated that the Company’s officers and directors will contact broker-dealers and other persons with whom they are acquainted who are involved with corporate finance matters to advise them of the Company’s existence and to determine if any companies or businesses that they represent have a general interest in considering a merger or acquisition with a blind pool or blank check or shell entity.   No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in finding or acquiring a desirable business opportunity, given the limited funds that are expected to be available for acquisitions.  Furthermore, no assurance can be given that any acquisition, which does occur, will be on terms that are favorable to the Company or its current stockholders.

The Company’s search will be directed toward small and medium-sized enterprises, which have a desire to become public corporations.  In addition these enterprises may wish to satisfy, either currently or in the reasonably near future, the minimum tangible asset requirement in order to qualify shares for trading on NASDAQ or on an exchange such as the American Stock Exchange.  The Company anticipates that the business opportunities presented to it will (I) either be in the process of formation, or be recently organized with limited operating history or a history of losses attributable to under-capitalization or other factors; (ii) experiencing financial or operating difficulties; (iii) be in need of funds to develop new products or services or to expand into a new market, or have plans for rapid expansion through acquisition of competing businesses; (iv) or other similar characteristics.  The Company intends to concentrate its acquisition efforts on properties or businesses that it believes to be undervalued or that it believes may realize a substantial benefit from being publicly owned.  Given the above factors, investors should expect that any acquisition candidate may have little or no operating history, or a history of losses or low profitability.

The Company does not propose to restrict its search for investment opportunities to any particular geographical area or industry, and may, therefore, engage in essentially any business, to the extent of its limited resources.  This include industries such as service, finance, natural resources, manufacturing, high technology, product development, medical, communications and others.  The Company’s discretion in the selection of business opportunities is unrestricted, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors.

Any entity that has an interest in being acquired by, or merging into the Company, is expected to be an entity that desires to become a public company and establish a public trading market for its securities. In connection with such a merger or acquisition, it is highly likely that an amount of stock constituting control of the Company would either be issued by the Company or be purchased from the current principal stockholders of the Company by the acquiring entity or its affiliates. If stock is purchased from the current principal stockholders, the transaction is likely to result in substantial gains to the current principal stockholders relative to their purchase price for such stock. In the Company’s judgment, none of the officers and directors would thereby become an underwriter within the meaning of the Section 2(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) as long as the transaction is a private transaction rather than a public distribution of securities. The sale of a controlling interest by certain principal shareholders of the Company would occur at a time when minority stockholders are unable to sell their shares because of the lack of a public market for such shares.

Depending upon the nature of the transaction, the current officers and directors of the Company may resign their management and board positions with the Company in connection with a change of control or acquisition of a business opportunity.  In the event of such a resignation, the Company’s current management would thereafter have no control over the conduct of the Company’s business.

It is anticipated that business opportunities will come to the Company’s attention from various sources, including its officers and directors, its other stockholders, professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, and others who may present unsolicited proposals. The Company has no plan, understandings, agreements, or commitments with any individual for such person to act as a finder of opportunities for the Company.

Investigation and Selection of Business Opportunities with an Affiliated Entity or Other Potential Entities

To a large extent, a decision to participate in a specific business opportunity may be made upon management’s analysis of the quality of the other Company’s management and personnel, the anticipated acceptability of new products or marketing concepts, the merit of technological changes, the perceived benefit the business opportunity will derive from becoming a publicly held entity, and numerous other factors which are difficult, if not impossible, to analyze through the application of any objective criteria.  In many instances, it is anticipated that the historical operations of a specific business opportunity may not necessarily be indicative of the potential for the future because of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the possible need to expand substantially, shift marketing approaches, change product emphasis, change or substantially augment management, raise capital and the like.

It is anticipated that the Company will not be able to diversify, but will essentially be limited to the acquisition of one business opportunity because of the Company’s limited financing.  This lack of diversification will not permit the Company to offset potential losses from one business opportunity against profits from another, and should be considered an adverse factor affecting any decision to purchase the Company’s securities.
 Certain types of business acquisition transactions may be completed without any requirement that the Company first submit the transaction to the stockholders for their approval.  In the event the proposed transaction is structured in such a fashion that stockholder approval is not required, holders of the Company’s securities (other than principal stockholders holding a controlling interest) should not anticipate that they will be provided with financial statements or any other documentation prior to the completion of the transaction.  Other types of transactions require prior approval of the stockholders.

In the event a proposed business combination or business acquisition transaction is structured in such a fashion that prior stockholder approval is necessary, the Company will be required to prepare a Proxy or Information Statement describing the proposed transaction, file it with the Securities and Exchange Commission for review and approval, and mail a copy of it to all Company stockholders prior to holding a stockholders meeting for purposes of voting on the proposal.  Minority shareholders that do not vote in favor of a proposed transaction will then have the right, in the event the transaction is approved by the required number of stockholders, to exercise statutory dissenter’s rights and elect to be paid the fair value of their shares.

The analysis of business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company’s officers and directors, none of whom are professional business analysts.  Although there are no current plans to do so, Company management might hire an outside consultant to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities, and might pay a finder’s fee.  Since Company management has no current plans to use any outside consultants or advisors to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities, no policies have been adopted regarding use of such consultants or advisors, the criteria to be used in selecting such consultants or advisors, the services to be provided, the term of service, or the total amount of fees that may be paid.  However, because of the limited resources of the Company, it is likely that any such fee the Company agrees to pay would be paid in stock and not in cash.

The Company is unable to predict when it may participate in a business opportunity.  It expects, however, that the analysis of specific proposals and the selection of a business opportunity may take several months or more.

Prior to making a decision to participate in a business opportunity, the Company will generally request that it be provided with written materials regarding the business opportunity containing as much relevant information as possible, including, but not limited to, such items as a description of products, services and Company history; management resumes; financial information; available projections, with related assumptions upon which they are based; an explanation of proprietary products and services; evidence of existing patents, trademarks, or service marks, or rights thereto; present and proposed forms of compensation to management; a description of transactions between such Company and its affiliates during the relevant periods; a description of present and required facilities; an analysis of risks and competitive conditions; a financial plan of operation and estimated capital requirements; audited financial statements, or if they are not available, unaudited financial statements, together with reasonable assurance that audited financial statements would be able to be produced within a reasonable period of time not to exceed 60 days following completion of a merger or acquisition transaction; and the like.

As part of the Company’s investigation, the Company’s executive officers and directors may meet personally with management and key personnel, may visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis or verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of the Company’s limited financial resources and management expertise.

It is possible that the range of business opportunities that might be available for consideration by the Company could be limited by the impact of Securities and Exchange Commission regulations regarding purchase and sale of penny stocks.  The regulations would affect, and possibly impair, any market that might develop in the Company’s securities until such time as they qualify for listing on NASDAQ or on an exchange which would make them exempt from applicability of the penny stock regulations.

Company management believes that various types of potential merger or acquisition candidates might find a business combination with the Company to be attractive.  These include acquisition candidates desiring to create a public market for their shares in order to enhance liquidity for current stockholders, acquisition candidates which have long-term plans for raising capital through public sale of securities and believe that the possible prior existence of a public market for their securities would be beneficial, and acquisition candidates which plan to acquire additional assets through issuance of securities rather than for cash, and believe that the possibility of development of a public market for their securities will be of assistance in that process.  Acquisition candidates, who have a need for an immediate cash infusion, are not likely to find a potential business combination with the Company to be an attractive alternative.
 
Form of Acquisition

It is impossible to predict the manner in which the Company may participate in a business opportunity.  Specific business opportunities will be reviewed as well as the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity and, upon the basis of the review and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters, the legal structure or method deemed by management to be suitable will be selected.  Such structure may include, but is not limited to leases, purchase and sale agreements, licenses, joint ventures and other contractual arrangements.  The Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or other form of organization.  Implementing such structure may require the merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with other corporations or forms of business organization.  In addition, the present management and stockholders of the Company most likely will not have control of a majority of the voting stock of the Company following a merger or reorganization transaction.  As part of such a transaction, the Company’s existing directors may resign and new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.

It is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of Common Stock or other securities of the Company.  Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called “B” tax free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, depends upon the issuance to the stockholders of the acquired Company of a controlling interest (i.e., 80% or more) of the common stock of the combined entities immediately following the reorganization.  If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other tax free provisions provided under the Internal Revenue Code, the Company’s current stockholders would retain in the aggregate 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares. This could result in substantial additional dilution in the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization.  Any such issuance of additional shares might also be done simultaneously with a sale or transfer of shares representing a controlling interest in the Company by the current officers, directors and principal stockholders.

It is anticipated that any new securities issued in any reorganization would be issued in reliance upon one or more exemptions from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws to the extent that such exemptions are available.  In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of the transaction, the Company may agree to register such securities either at the time the transaction is consummated or under certain conditions at specified times thereafter.  The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market that might develop in the Company’s securities may have a depressive effect upon such market.

The Company will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of a written agreement.  Although the terms of such agreement cannot be predicted, generally such an agreement would require specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto, specify certain events of default, detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties thereto prior to such closing, outline the manner of bearing costs if the transaction is not closed, set forth remedies upon default, and include miscellaneous other terms.

As a general matter, the Company anticipates that it, and/or its principal stockholders will enter into a letter of intent with the management, principals or owners of a prospective business opportunity prior to signing a binding agreement.  Such a letter of intent will set forth the terms of the proposed acquisition but will not bind any of the parties to consummate the transaction.  Execution of a letter of intent will by no means indicate that consummation of an acquisition is probable.  Neither the Company nor any of the other parties to the letter of intent will be bound to consummate the acquisition unless and until a definitive agreement is executed.  Even after a definitive agreement is executed, it is possible that the acquisition would not be consummated should any party elect to exercise any right provided in the agreement to terminate it on specific grounds.

It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others.  If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable.  Moreover, because many providers of goods and services require compensation at the time or soon after the goods and services are provided, the inability of the Company to pay until an indeterminate future time may make it impossible to produce goods and services.

Investment Company Act and Other Regulation

The Company may participate in a business opportunity by purchasing, trading or selling the securities of such business.  The Company does not, however, intend to engage primarily in such activities.  Specifically, the Company intends to conduct its activities so as to avoid being classified as an investment Company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Act), and therefore to avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
The Company’s plan of business may involve changes in its capital structure, management, control and business, especially if it consummates the reorganization as discussed above.  Each of these areas is regulated by the Investment Act, in order to protect purchasers of investment Company securities. Since the Company will not register as an investment Company, stockholders will not be afforded these protections.
 
Competition

The Company expects to encounter substantial competition in its efforts to locate attractive business combination opportunities.  The competition may in part come from business development companies, venture capital partnerships and corporations, small investment companies, brokerage firms, and the like.  Some of these types of organizations are likely to be in a better position than the Company to obtain access to attractive business acquisition candidates either because they have greater experience, resources and managerial capabilities than the Company, because they are able to offer immediate access to limited amounts of cash, or for a variety of other reasons.  The Company also will experience competition from other public companies with similar business purposes, some of which may also have funds available for use by an acquisition candidate.
Employees

The Company currently has no employees.  Management of the Company expects to use consultants, attorneys and accountants as necessary, and does not anticipate a need to engage any full-time employees so long as it is seeking and evaluating business opportunities.  The need for employees and their availability will be addressed in connection with the decision whether or not to acquire or participate in specific business opportunities.
Facilities

Our principal place of business is located in the business office of our President, Una Taylor, at 95 Merrick Way, Third Floor, Coral Gables, Florida 33143. Management believes that the current facilities are adequate for the immediate future.
Industry Segments

No information is presented regarding industry segments. We are presently an exploration stage company engaged in the mineral exploration business and considered an exploration stage mining company. Reference is made to the statements of income included in this Form 10-K for a report of our operating history for the past two fiscal years.
