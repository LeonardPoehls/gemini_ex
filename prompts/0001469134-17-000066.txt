Item 1. Business
First Community
First Community Financial Partners, Inc. (“First Community” or the “Company”) was formed as a bank holding company in 2006. First Community is headquartered in Joliet, Illinois. First Community has one banking subsidiary, First Community Financial Bank (the “Bank”). The Bank is the result of the consolidation of our four legacy banking subsidiaries and affiliates.
On February 6, 2017, First Community entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with First Busey Corporation, a Nevada corporation (“First Busey”), pursuant to which First Community will merge into First Busey, with First Busey as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”). It is anticipated that the Bank will be merged with and into First Busey’s bank subsidiary, Busey Bank, at a date following the completion of the Merger. At the time of the bank merger, the Bank’s banking offices will become branches of Busey Bank. The Merger is anticipated to be completed in mid-2017, and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions contained in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, including the approval of the appropriate regulatory authorities and the stockholders of First Community.
On July 1, 2016, First Community completed its acquisition of Mazon State Bank through the merger of Mazon State Bank with and into the Bank. In connection with the merger, First Community paid aggregate merger consideration of $8.5 million in cash. For additional information on this merger, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
As of December 31, 2016, on a consolidated basis, First Community had total assets of $1.3 billion, total deposits of $1.1 billion and total shareholders’ equity of $113.7 million. For the Company’s complete financial information as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
The Bank
The Bank is a full-service community bank principally engaged in the business of commercial, family and personal banking, and offers customers a broad range of loan, deposit, and other financial products and services through nine full-service banking offices located in Cook, DuPage, Grundy, and Will Counties, Illinois. 
The Bank’s primary business is making loans and accepting deposits. The Bank also offers customers a variety of financial products and services that are related or ancillary to loans and deposits, including cash management, funds transfers, bill payment and other online banking transactions, automated teller machines, and safe deposit boxes.
The Bank’s primary lending area consists of the counties where its banking offices are located, and contiguous counties in the State of Illinois. The Bank derives the most significant portion of its revenues from these geographic areas. 
The Bank originates deposits predominantly from the areas where its banking offices are located. The Bank relies on its favorable locations, customer service, competitive pricing, internet and mobile banking, and related deposit services, such as cash management, to attract and retain deposits. While the Bank accepts certificates of deposit in excess of FDIC deposit insurance limits, the Bank generally does not solicit such deposits because they are more difficult to retain than core deposits and at times are more costly than wholesale deposits. 
Lending Activities 
At December 31, 2016, $36.7 million, or 3.70% of the total loan portfolio, consisted of multi-family mortgage loans; $426.0 million, or 42.96% of the total loan portfolio, consisted of other commercial real estate loans; $281.8 million, or 28.42% of the total loan portfolio, consisted of commercial and industrial loans; $47.3 million, or 4.77%, of the total loan portfolio, consisted of construction and land development loans; and $176.0 million, or 17.75% of the total loan portfolio, consisted of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit. In addition, the Bank had farm and agricultural loans totaling $12.6 million, or 1.27%, and consumer and other loans totaling $8.0 million, or 0.80%, of the total portfolio as of December 31, 2016. The Bank’s loan portfolio consists primarily of non-residential real estate loans (owner occupied commercial real estate and investor commercial real estate, multi-family, construction and land development loans), which represented 52.71% of the total loan portfolio, or $522.7 million, at December 31, 2016. 
Deposit Activities 
The Bank’s deposit accounts consist principally of savings accounts, NOW accounts, checking accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, and individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”) and other qualified plan accounts. The 
4

Bank also provides commercial checking accounts and related services such as cash management, as well as provide low-cost checking account services. 
At December 31, 2016, the Bank’s deposits totaled $1.1 billion; interest bearing deposits totaled $835.3 million; non-interest bearing demand deposits totaled $247.9 million; savings, money market and NOW account deposits totaled $508.4 million; and certificates of deposit totaled $326.9 million.
Competition 
First Community and the Bank face significant competition in both originating loans and attracting deposits. The Chicago metropolitan area has a high concentration of financial institutions, many of which are significantly larger institutions that have greater financial resources than us, and many of which are our competitors to varying degrees. Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, mortgage banking companies, the U.S. government, credit unions, leasing companies, insurance companies, FinTech companies, real estate conduits and other companies that provide financial services to businesses and individuals. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from Internet-based financial institutions and non-depository competitors such as the mutual fund industry, securities and brokerage firms and insurance companies. 
We seek to meet this competition by emphasizing personalized service and efficient decision-making tailored to individual needs. In addition, we reward long-standing relationships with preferred rates and terms on deposit products based on existing and prospective lending business. We do not rely on any individual, group or entity for a material portion of our loans or our deposits. 
Employees 
At December 31, 2016, First Community and the Bank had 131 full-time employees and 24 part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and we consider our working relationship with our employees to be good.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
General
FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, our growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (the “DFPR”), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”). Furthermore, taxation laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, securities laws administered by the SEC and state securities authorities, and anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) have an impact on the Company’s business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and accounting rules are significant to the Company’s operations and results.
Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than shareholders. These laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of the Company’s business, the kinds and amounts of investments the Company and the Bank may make, reserve requirements, required capital levels relative to assets, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the Company’s ability to merge, consolidate and acquire, dealings with the Company’s and the Bank’s insiders and affiliates, and the Company’s payment of dividends. In the last several years, the Company has experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny following the global financial crisis and as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). Although 
5

the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence filtered down in varying degrees to community banks over time and the reforms have caused the Company’s compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase. While it is anticipated that the Trump administration will not increase the regulatory burden on community banks and may reduce some of the burdens associated with implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, the true impact of the new administration is impossible to predict with any certainty.
This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that are not publicly available and that can impact the conduct and growth of their business. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies.
The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to First Community and the Bank, beginning with a discussion of the continuing regulatory emphasis on the Company’s capital levels. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision.
Regulatory Emphasis on Capital
Regulatory capital represents the net assets of a banking organization available to absorb losses. Because of the risks attendant to their business, FDIC-insured institutions are generally required to hold more capital than other businesses, which directly affects the Company’s earnings capabilities. While capital has historically been one of the key measures of the financial health of both bank holding companies and banks, its role became fundamentally more important in the wake of the global financial crisis, as the banking regulators recognized that the amount and quality of capital held by banks prior to the crisis was insufficient to absorb losses during periods of severe stress. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, discussed below, establish strengthened capital standards for banks and bank holding companies that are meaningfully more stringent than those in place previously.
Minimum Required Capital Levels. Banks have been required to hold minimum levels of capital based on guidelines established by the bank regulatory agencies since 1983. The minimums have been expressed in terms of ratios of capital divided by total assets. As discussed below, bank capital measures have become more sophisticated over the years and have focused more on the quality of capital and the risk of assets. Bank holding companies have historically had to comply with less stringent capital standards than their bank subsidiaries and have been able to raise capital with hybrid instruments such as trust preferred securities. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated the Federal Reserve to establish minimum capital levels for holding companies on a consolidated basis as stringent as those required for FDIC-insured institutions.
The Basel International Capital Accords. The risk-based capital guidelines for U.S. banks since 1989 were based upon the 1988 capital accord known as “Basel I” adopted by the international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central banks and bank supervisors that acts as the primary global standard-setter for prudential regulation, as implemented by the U.S. bank regulatory agencies on an interagency basis. The accord recognized that bank assets for the purpose of the capital ratio calculations needed to be risk weighted (the theory being that riskier assets should require more capital) and that off-balance sheet exposures needed to be factored in the calculations. Basel I had a very simple formula for assigning risk weights to bank assets from 0% to 100% based on four categories. In 2008, the banking agencies collaboratively began to phase-in capital standards based on a second capital accord, referred to as “Basel II,” for large or “core” international banks (generally defined for U.S. purposes as having total assets of $250 billion or more, or consolidated foreign exposures of $10 billion or more) known as “advanced approaches” banks. The primary focus of Basel II was on the calculation of risk weights based on complex models developed by each advanced approaches bank. Because most banks were not subject to Basel II, the U.S. bank regulators worked to improve the risk sensitivity of Basel I standards without imposing the complexities of Basel II. This “standardized approach” increased the number of risk-weight categories and recognized risks well above the original 100% risk weighting. The standardized approach is institutionalized by the Dodd-Frank Act for all banking organizations as a floor. 
On September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement on a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations around the world, known as Basel III, to address deficiencies recognized in connection with the global financial crisis.  
The Basel III Rule. In July of 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in pertinent part, and, at the same time, promulgated rules effecting certain changes required by the 
6

Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Rule”). In contrast to capital requirements historically, which were in the form of guidelines, Basel III was released in the form of enforceable regulations by each of the regulatory agencies. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all banking organizations that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and state banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies, other than “small bank holding companies” (generally holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $1 billion that do not have securities registered with the SEC). 
The Basel III Rule required higher capital levels, increased the required quality of capital, and required more detailed categories of risk weighting of riskier, more opaque assets. For nearly every class of assets, the Basel III Rule requires a more complex, detailed and calibrated assessment of credit risk and calculation of risk weightings. 
Not only did the Basel III Rule increase most of the required minimum capital ratios in effect prior to January 1, 2015, but it introduced the concept of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, which consists primarily of common stock, related surplus (net of Treasury stock), retained earnings, and Common Equity Tier 1 minority interests subject to certain regulatory adjustments. The Basel III Rule also changed the definition of capital by establishing more stringent criteria that instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (primarily non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock that meets certain requirements) and Tier 2 Capital (primarily other types of preferred stock and subordinated debt, subject to limitations). A number of instruments that qualified as Tier 1 Capital under Basel I do not qualify, or their qualifications changed. For example, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, which qualified as simple Tier 1 Capital under Basel I, does not qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but qualifies as Additional Tier 1 Capital. The Basel III Rule also constrained the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets in capital and requires deductions from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital in the event that such assets exceed a certain percentage of a banking institution’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. 
The Basel III Rule required minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015, as follows: 

• | A ratio of minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets;


• | An increase in the minimum required amount of Tier 1 Capital from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets;


• | A continuation of the minimum required amount of Total Capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) at 8% of risk-weighted assets; and


• | A minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total quarterly average assets equal to 4% in all circumstances.

In addition, institutions that seek the freedom to make capital distributions (including for dividends and repurchases of stock) and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction must also maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to a capital conservation buffer being phased in over three years beginning in 2016 (which, as of January 1, 2017, was phased in half-way to 1.25%). The purpose of the conservation buffer is to ensure that banking institutions maintain a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses during periods of financial and economic stress. Factoring in the fully phased-in conservation buffer increases the minimum ratios depicted above to 7% for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 8.5% for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5% for Total Capital. 
Banking organizations (except for large, internationally active banking organizations) became subject to the new rules on January 1, 2015. However, there are separate phase-in/phase-out periods for: (i) the capital conservation buffer; (ii) regulatory capital adjustments and deductions; (iii) nonqualifying capital instruments; and (iv) changes to the prompt corrective action rules discussed below. The phase-in periods commenced on January 1, 2016 and extend until 2019.
Well-Capitalized Requirements. The ratios described above are minimum standards in order for banking organizations to be considered “adequately capitalized.” Bank regulatory agencies uniformly encourage banks to hold more capital and be “well-capitalized” and, to that end, federal law and regulations provide various incentives for banking organizations to maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. For example, a banking organization that is well-capitalized may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications; and (iii) accept, roll-over or renew brokered deposits. Higher capital levels could also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. For example, the Federal Reserve’s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. Further, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions (i.e., Tier 1 Capital less all intangible assets), well above the minimum levels.
Under the capital regulations of the FDIC and Federal Reserve, in order to be well‑capitalized, a banking organization must maintain:

• | A Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio to risk-weighted assets of 6.5% or more;


• | A ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8% or more (6% under Basel I); 


• | A ratio of Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 10% or more (the same as Basel I); and


• | A leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total adjusted average quarterly assets of 5% or greater.

7

It is possible under the Basel III Rule to be well-capitalized while remaining out of compliance with the capital conservation buffer discussed above.
As of December 31, 2016: (i) the Bank was not subject to a directive from the DFPR or FDIC to increase its capital and (ii) the Bank was well-capitalized, as defined by FDIC regulations. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had regulatory capital in excess of the Federal Reserve’s requirements and met the Basel III Rule requirements to be well-capitalized. 
Prompt Corrective Action. An FDIC-insured institution’s capital plays an important role in connection with regulatory enforcement as well. Federal law provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The extent of the regulators’ powers depends on whether the institution in question is “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized,” in each case as defined by regulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators’ corrective powers include: (i) requiring the institution to submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) limiting the institution’s asset growth and restricting its activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to sell itself; (iv) restricting transactions between the institution and its affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate that the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution.
Regulation and Supervision of First Community
General. The Company, as the sole shareholder of the Bank, is a bank holding company. As a bank holding company, the Company is registered with, and subject to regulation, supervision and enforcement by, the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”). The Company is legally obligated to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances where the Company might not otherwise do so. Under the BHCA, the Company is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve and is required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports of the Company’s operations and such additional information regarding the Company and the Bank as the Federal Reserve may require. 
Acquisitions, Activities and Change in Control. The primary purpose of a bank holding company is to control and manage banks. The BHCA generally requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for any merger involving a bank holding company or any acquisition by a bank holding company of another bank or bank holding company. Subject to certain conditions (including deposit concentration limits established by the BHCA), the Federal Reserve may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States. In approving interstate acquisitions, the Federal Reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its FDIC-insured institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state institutions or their holding companies) and state laws that require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company. Furthermore, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and examiners must rate them well-managed in order to effect interstate mergers or acquisitions. For a discussion of the capital requirements, see “Regulatory Emphasis on Capital” above.
The BHCA generally prohibits the Company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries. This general prohibition is subject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in, and to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve prior to November 11, 1999 to be “so closely related to banking ... as to be a proper incident thereto.” This authority would permit the Company to engage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including the ownership and operation of a savings association, or any entity engaged in consumer finance, equipment leasing, the operation of a computer service bureau (including software development) and mortgage banking and brokerage services. The BHCA does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies.
Additionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the BHCA and elect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities, including securities and insurance underwriting and sales, merchant banking and any other activity that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines by regulation or order is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the Federal Reserve determines by order to be complementary to any such financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of FDIC-insured institutions or the financial system generally. The Company has not elected to operate as a financial holding company. 
Federal law also prohibits any person or company from acquiring “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator. “Control” is conclusively presumed to 
8

exist upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, but may arise under certain circumstances between 10% and 24.99% ownership. 
Capital Requirements. Bank holding companies are required to maintain capital in accordance with Federal Reserve capital adequacy requirements. For a discussion of capital requirements, see “Regulatory Emphasis on Capital” above.
Dividend Payments. Our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders may be affected by both general corporate law considerations and policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies. As an Illinois corporation, we are subject to the Illinois Business Corporation Act, as amended, which prohibits us from paying a dividend if, after giving effect to the dividend: (i) First Community would be insolvent; (ii) the net assets of First Community would be less than zero; or (iii) the net assets of First Community would be less than the maximum amount then payable to shareholders of First Community who would have preferential distribution rights if we were liquidated. 
As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends to shareholders if: (i) the company’s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. The Federal Reserve also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends will have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer to be phased in over three years beginning in 2016. See “Regulatory Emphasis on Capital” above.
Incentive Compensation. There have been a number of developments in recent years focused on incentive compensation plans sponsored by bank holding companies and banks, reflecting recognition by the bank regulatory agencies and Congress that flawed incentive compensation practices in the financial industry were one of many factors contributing to the global financial crisis. Layered on top of that are the abuses in the headlines dealing with product cross-selling incentive plans. The result is interagency guidance on sound incentive compensation practices and proposed rulemaking by the agencies required under Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
The interagency guidance recognized three core principles: effective incentive plans should: (i) provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward; (ii) be compatible with effective controls and risk-management; and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. Much of the guidance addresses large banking organizations and, because of the size and complexity of their operations, the regulators expect those organizations to maintain systematic and formalized policies, procedures, and systems for ensuring that the incentive compensation arrangements for all executive and non-executive employees covered by this guidance are identified and reviewed, and appropriately balance risks and rewards.  Smaller banking organizations like the Company that use incentive compensation arrangements are expected to be less extensive, formalized, and detailed than those of the larger banks.  
Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act required the banking agencies, the National Credit Union Administration, the SEC and the Federal Housing Finance Agency to jointly prescribe regulations that prohibit types of incentive-based compensation that encourage inappropriate risk taking and to disclose certain information regarding such plans. On June 10, 2016, the agencies released an updated proposed rule for comment. Section 956 will only apply to banking organizations with assets of greater than $1 billion. The Company has consolidated assets greater than $1 billion and less than $50 billion and the Company is considered a Level 3 banking organization under the proposed rules. The proposed rules contain mostly general principles and reporting requirements for Level 3 institutions so there are no specific prescriptions or limits, deferral requirements or claw-back mandates. Risk management and controls are required, as is board or committee level approval and oversight. Management expects to review its incentive plans in light of the proposed rulemaking and guidance and implement policies and procedures that mitigate unreasonable risk.
Monetary Policy. The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has a significant effect on the operating results of financial or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the tools available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market transactions in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.
Federal Securities Regulation. Our common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Consequently, we are subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act.

Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act addressed many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. It increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments, and authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate and solicit voters for their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of bank holding companies, regardless of whether such companies are publicly traded.
Supervision and Regulation of the Bank
General. The Bank is an Illinois-chartered bank. The deposit accounts of the Bank are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) to the maximum extent provided under federal law and FDIC regulations, currently $250,000 per insured depositor category. As an Illinois-chartered FDIC-insured bank, the Bank is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the DFPR, the chartering authority for Illinois banks, and the FDIC, designated by federal law as the primary federal regulator of insured state banks that, like the Bank, are not members of the Federal Reserve System (“nonmember banks”).
Deposit Insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC.  The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification.   Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC changed its pricing system for banks under $10 billion, like the Bank, so that minimum and maximum initial base assessment rates are established based on supervisory ratings. The initial base assessment rates currently range from three basis points to 30 basis points. At least semi-annually, the FDIC updates its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increases or decreases the assessment rates, following notice and comment on proposed rulemaking. The assessment base against which an FDIC-insured institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the DIF are calculated is based on its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. This method shifts the burden of deposit insurance premiums toward those large depository institutions that rely on funding sources other than U.S. deposits.  
The reserve ratio is the DIF balance divided by estimated insured deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act altered the minimum reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to FDIC-insured institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.  The reserve ratio reached 1.15% on June 30, 2016, when revised factors were put in place for calculating the assessment.  If the reserve ratio does not reach 1.35% by December 31, 2018 (provided it is at least 1.15%), the FDIC will impose a shortfall assessment on March 31, 2019 on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. The FDIC will provide assessment credits to insured depository institutions, like the Bank, with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion for the portion of their regular assessments that contribute to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. The FDIC will apply the credits each quarter that the reserve ratio is at least 1.38% to offset the regular deposit insurance assessments of institutions with credits.
FICO Assessments. In addition to paying basic deposit insurance assessments, FDIC-insured institutions must pay Financing Corporation (“FICO”) assessments. FICO is a mixed-ownership governmental corporation chartered by the former Federal Home Loan Bank Board pursuant to the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 to function as a financing vehicle for the recapitalization of the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. FICO issued 30-year noncallable bonds of approximately $8.1 billion that mature in 2017 through 2019. FICO’s authority to issue bonds ended on December 12, 1991. Since 1996, federal legislation has required that all FDIC-insured institutions pay assessments to cover interest payments on FICO’s outstanding obligations. The FICO assessment rate is adjusted quarterly and for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 0.560 basis points (56 cents per $100 dollars of assessable deposits).
Supervisory Assessments. All Illinois banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the DFPR to fund the operations of that agency. The amount of the assessment is calculated on the basis of the Bank’s total assets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Bank paid supervisory assessments to the DFPR totaling approximately $115,000. 
Capital Requirements. Banks are generally required to maintain capital levels in excess of other businesses. For a discussion of capital requirements, see “Regulatory Emphasis on Capital” above.
Liquidity Requirements. Liquidity is a measure of the ability and ease with which bank assets may be converted to cash. Liquid assets are those that can be converted to cash quickly if needed to meet financial obligations. To remain viable, FDIC-insured institutions must have enough liquid assets to meet their near-term obligations, such as withdrawals by depositors. Because the global financial crisis was in part a liquidity crisis, Basel III also includes a liquidity framework that requires FDIC-insured institutions to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests. One test, referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”), is designed to ensure that the banking entity has an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets that can be converted easily and immediately in private markets into cash to meet liquidity needs for a 30-calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The other test, known as the Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”), is designed to promote 
10

more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of FDIC-insured institutions over a one-year horizon. These tests provide an incentive for banks and holding companies to increase their holdings in Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets, increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source and rely on stable funding like core deposits (in lieu of brokered deposits).
In addition to liquidity guidelines already in place, the federal bank regulatory agencies implemented the Basel III LCR in 2014 and have proposed the NSFR. While the LCR only applies to the largest banking organizations in the country, as will the NSFR, certain elements are expected to filter down to all FDIC-insured institutions. The Company continues to review the Company’s liquidity risk management policies in light of the LCR and NSFR.
Dividend Payments. The primary source of funds for First Community is dividends from the Bank. Under the Illinois Banking Act, the Bank generally may not pay dividends in excess of its net profits. The payment of dividends by any FDIC-insured institution is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and an FDIC-insured institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be undercapitalized. As described above, the Bank exceeded its minimum capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of December 31, 2016. Notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends, however, the FDIC and the DFPR may prohibit the payment of dividends by the Bank if either or both determine such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends will have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer to be phased in over three years beginning in 2016. See “Regulatory Emphasis on Capital” above.
State Bank Investments and Activities. The Bank is permitted to make investments and engage in activities directly or through subsidiaries as authorized by Illinois law. However, under federal law and FDIC regulations, FDIC-insured state banks are prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from making or retaining equity investments of a type, or in an amount, that are not permissible for a national bank. Federal law and FDIC regulations also prohibit FDIC-insured state banks and their subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, from engaging as principal in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank unless the Bank meets, and continues to meet, its minimum regulatory capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity would not pose a significant risk to the DIF. These restrictions have not had, and are not currently expected to have, a material impact on the operations of the Bank.
Insider Transactions. The Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on “covered transactions” between the Bank and its “affiliates.” The Company is an affiliate of the Bank for purposes of these restrictions, and covered transactions subject to the restrictions include extensions of credit to the Company, investments in the stock or other securities of the Company and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of the Company as collateral for loans made by the Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.
Certain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by the Bank to its directors and officers, to directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, to principal shareholders of the Company and to “related interests” of such directors, officers and principal shareholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person who is a director or officer of the Company or the Bank, or a principal shareholder of the Company, may obtain credit from banks with which the Bank maintains a correspondent relationship. 
Safety and Soundness Standards/Risk Management. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines that establish operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of FDIC-insured institutions. The guidelines set forth standards for internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings.
In general, the safety and soundness guidelines prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals. If an institution fails to comply with any of the standards set forth in the guidelines, the FDIC-insured institution’s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance. If an FDIC-insured institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal regulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency. Until the deficiency cited in the regulator’s order is cured, the regulator may restrict the FDIC-insured institution’s rate of growth, require the FDIC-insured institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances. Noncompliance with the standards established by the safety and soundness guidelines may also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal bank regulatory agencies, including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments.
During the past decade, the bank regulatory agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of sound risk management processes and strong internal controls when evaluating the activities of the FDIC-insured institutions they 
11

supervise.  Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of financial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets.  The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, and reputational risk. In particular, recent regulatory pronouncements have focused on operational risk, which arises from the potential that inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses. New products and services, third-party risk and cybersecurity are critical sources of operational risk that FDIC-insured institutions are expected to address in the current environment. The Bank is expected to have active board and senior management oversight; adequate policies, procedures, and limits; adequate risk measurement, monitoring, and management information systems; and comprehensive internal controls.
Branching Authority. Illinois banks, such as the Bank, have the authority under Illinois law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Illinois, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. Federal law permits state and national banks to merge with banks in other states subject to: (i) regulatory approval; (ii) federal and state deposit concentration limits; and (iii) state law limitations requiring the merging bank to have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) prior to the merger. The Dodd-Frank Act permits well-capitalized and well-managed banks to establish new interstate branches or acquire individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) without impediments.
Transaction Account Reserves. Federal Reserve regulations require FDIC-insured institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). For 2017: the first $15.5 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempt from reserves and have a zero percent reserve requirement; for transaction accounts aggregating more than $15.5 million to $115.1 million, the reserve requirement is 3% of total transaction accounts; and for net transaction accounts in excess of $115.1 million, the reserve requirement is 3% up to $115.1 million plus 10% of the aggregate amount of total transaction accounts in excess of $115.1 million. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (the “FHLB”), which serves as a central credit facility for its members. The FHLB is funded primarily from proceeds from the sale of obligations of the FHLB system. It makes loans to member banks in the form of FHLB advances. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully collateralized as determined by the FHLB.
Community Reinvestment Act Requirements. The Community Reinvestment Act requires the Bank to have a continuing and affirmative obligation in a safe and sound manner to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Federal regulators regularly assess the Bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its communities. Applications for additional acquisitions would be affected by the evaluation of the Bank’s effectiveness in meeting its Community Reinvestment Act requirements.
Anti-Money Laundering. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) is designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the U.S. financial system and has significant implications for FDIC-insured institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The Patriot Act mandates financial services companies to have policies and procedures with respect to measures designed to address any or all of the following matters: (i) customer identification programs; (ii) money laundering; (iii) terrorist financing; (iv) identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions; (v) currency crimes; and (vi) cooperation between FDIC-insured institutions and law enforcement authorities.
Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate. Concentration risk exists when FDIC-insured institutions deploy too many assets to any one industry or segment. A concentration in commercial real estate is one example of regulatory concern. The interagency Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices guidance (“CRE Guidance”) provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) commercial real estate loans exceeding 300% of capital and increasing 50% or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100% of capital. The CRE Guidance does not limit banks’ levels of commercial real estate lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies issued a statement to reinforce prudent risk-management practices related to CRE lending, having observed substantial growth in many CRE asset and lending markets, increased competitive pressures, rising CRE concentrations in banks, and an easing of CRE underwriting standards. The federal bank agencies reminded FDIC-insured institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise prudent risk-management practices to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the risks arising from CRE lending. In addition, FDIC-insured institutions must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentration risk.
12

Based on the Bank’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016, it did not exceed the 300% guideline for commercial real estate loans.
Consumer Financial Services. The historical structure of federal consumer protection regulation applicable to all providers of consumer financial products and services changed significantly on July 21, 2011, when the CFPB commenced operations to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all providers of consumer products and services, including the Bank, as well as the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over providers with more than $10 billion in assets. FDIC-insured institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, like the Bank, continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators.
Because abuses in connection with residential mortgages were a significant factor contributing to the global financial crisis, many new rules issued by the CFPB and required by the Dodd-Frank Act address mortgage and mortgage-related products, their underwriting, origination, servicing and sales. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded underwriting requirements applicable to loans secured by 1-4 family residential real property and augmented federal law combating predatory lending practices. In addition to numerous disclosure requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act imposed new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including all FDIC-insured institutions, in an effort to strongly encourage lenders to verify a borrower’s “ability to repay,” while also establishing a presumption of compliance for certain “qualified mortgages.” In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act generally required lenders or securitizers to retain an economic interest in the credit risk relating to loans that the lender sells, and other asset-backed securities that the securitizer issues, if the loans have not complied with the ability-to-repay standards. We do not currently expect the CFPB’s rules to have a significant impact on our operations, except for higher compliance costs.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. | Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of First Community Financial Partners, Inc. (the “Company” or “First Community”) and its subsidiaries, including its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, First Community Financial Bank (the “Bank”), based in Joliet, Illinois, and other wholly-owned real estate holding entities.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Nature of operations: First Community is a bank holding company providing a full range of financial services to individuals and corporate clients through the Bank. 
Use of estimates: In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses, valuation of foreclosed assets, and the valuation of deferred tax assets.
Presentation of cash flows: For purposes of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items and balances due from banks. Cash flows from federal funds sold, interest bearing deposits in banks, loans originated by the Company, deposits and other borrowings are reported as net increases or decreases.
Interest-bearing deposits in banks: Interest bearing deposits in banks mature within one year and are carried at cost.
Securities: All securities are classified as available for sale as the Company intends to hold the securities for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Securities available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income, net of the related deferred tax effect. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities.
Declines in the fair value of individual securities available for sale below their cost that are related to credit losses are deemed to be other-than-temporary and reflected in earnings as realized losses. In determining whether other-than-temporary impairment exists, management considers many factors, including (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) the intent or requirement of the Company to sell its investment in the issuer prior to any anticipated recovery in fair value. Gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific identification method. 
Non-marketable equity securities: The Company owns common stock issued by the FHLB. No ready market exists for these stocks, and they have no quoted market values. The Bank, as a member of the FHLB, is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB. The stock is redeemable at par value by the FHLB, and is therefore, carried at cost and periodically evaluated for impairment. The Company records dividends in income on the date received.
Loans held for sale: Loans held for sale consists of loans the Company has identified for sale. The loans are transferred from the portfolio to held for sale once the determination is made and they are carried at fair value less any costs to sell with charges being taken through the allowance for loan and lease losses.
Loans: The Company grants commercial, commercial and residential mortgage and consumer loans to clients. A substantial portion of the loan portfolio is represented by commercial and commercial mortgage loans throughout communities in Will, Grundy, DuPage, Cook, and Kane counties in Illinois. The ability of the Company’s loan clients to honor their contracts is dependent upon general economic conditions and real estate values in this area.
Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off generally are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balances adjusted for charge-offs, the allowance for loan and lease losses, and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the related loan yield.
58

The accrual of interest is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well-secured and in process of collection. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. 
All interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on non-accrual or charged-off is reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. 
Troubled debt restructurings: Loans are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties that leads to a restructuring of the loan, and the Company grants a “concession” to the borrower that they would not otherwise consider. These concessions include a modification of terms such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or loan balance, a reduction of accrued interest, an extension of the maturity date at an interest rate lower than a current market rate for a new loan with similar risk, or some combination thereof to facilitate repayment. 
TDRs are classified as impaired loans. TDRs are reviewed at the time of modification and on a quarterly basis to determine if a specific reserve is needed. The carrying amount of the loan is compared to the expected payments to be received, discounted at the loan’s original rate, or for collateral dependent loans, to the fair value of the collateral. Any shortfall is recorded as a specific reserve. Payment performance prior and subsequent to the restructuring is taken into account in assessing whether it is likely that the borrower can meet the new terms. A period of sustained repayment for at least six months generally is required for return to accrual status. This may result in the loan being returned to accrual at the time of restructuring. A loan that is modified at a market rate of interest will not be classified as a TDR in the calendar year subsequent to the restructuring if it is in compliance with the modified terms. 
Allowance for loan and lease losses: The allowance for loan and lease losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.
When establishing the allowance for loan and lease losses, management categorizes loans into risk categories generally based on the nature of the collateral and the basis of repayment. These risk categories and the relevant risk characteristics are as follows:
Construction and land development loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analyses of absorption and lease rates, and financial analyses of the developers and property owners. Construction and land development loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project. Construction and land development loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment primarily dependent upon the success of the completed project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be permanent loans from long-term lenders, sales of developed property, or an interim loan commitment until permanent financing is obtained. Generally, these loans have a higher risk profile than other real estate loans due to their repayment being sensitive to real estate values, interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, demand and supply of alternative real estate, the availability of long-term financing, and changes in general economic conditions. 
Commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower’s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business. Underwriting standards are designed to ensure repayment of loans and mitigate loss exposure. As part of the underwriting process, the Company examines current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay its obligation as agreed. Commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of the borrower, however, may not be as expected, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory, and usually incorporate a personal guarantee. However, some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent upon the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. Agricultural production loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial loans.
Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial loans, in addition to those standards and processes specific to real estate loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is largely dependent upon the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business 
59

conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate market or in the general economy. The properties securing the Company’s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location within Will, Grundy, Dupage, Cook and Kane counties and their surrounding communities. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on cash flow, collateral, geography, and risk grade criteria. Farmland loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial real estate loans.
Residential 1-4 family and consumer loans are underwritten by evaluating the credit history of the borrower, the ability of the borrower to meet the debt service requirements of the loan and total debt obligations, as well as the underlying collateral and the loan to collateral value. Underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements, which include, but are not limited to, loan-to-value and affordability ratios, risk-based pricing strategies, and documentation requirements. Included in the Company’s residential 1-4 family loans are loans made to investors. These loans are underwritten using the same criteria as other residential 1-4 family loans. 
The allowance for loan and lease losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management’s periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company’s allowance for loan and lease losses, and may require the Company to recognize adjustments to its allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations.
The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to impaired loans. For loans classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the collateral value, discounted cash flows or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers non-classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. These qualitative factors consider local economic trends, concentrations, management experience, and other elements of the Company’s lending operations.
A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining the impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. 
Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis by either the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or the loan’s obtainable market price.
Residential 1-4 family and consumer loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, the Company does not separately identify individual consumer loans for impairment disclosures, unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement.
Premises and equipment: Land is carried at cost. Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed over the lesser of the remaining lease term, including renewal options controlled by the Company or the assets’ useful lives using the straight-line method.
Foreclosed assets: Assets acquired through loan foreclosure or other proceedings are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure establishing a new cost basis. After foreclosure, foreclosed assets are held for sale and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs of disposal. Any valuation adjustments required at the date of transfer are charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses.  Subsequently, unrealized losses and realized losses on sales are included in noninterest expense, while realized gains on sales are included in noninterest income.  Operating results from foreclosed assets are recorded in noninterest expense.
Cash surrender value of life insurance: The Bank has purchased bank-owned life insurance policies on certain executives. Bank-owned life insurance is recorded at its cash surrender value. Changes in the cash surrender values and death proceeds after recovery of cash surrender values are included in non-interest income.
60

Transfers of financial assets: Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company, put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets.
The transfer of a participating interest in an entire financial asset must also meet the definition of a participating interest. A participating interest in a financial asset has all of the following characteristics: (1) from the date of transfer, it must represent a proportionate (pro rata) ownership interest in the financial asset, (2) from the date of transfer, all cash flows received, except any cash flows allocated as any compensation for servicing or other services performed, must be divided proportionately among participating interest holders in the amount equal to their share ownership, (3) the rights of each participating interest holder must have the same priority, (4) no party has the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree to do so.
Income taxes: Deferred taxes are provided using the liability method. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely- -than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
The Company follows the accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which sets out a consistent framework to determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions. There are no uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized or sustained upon examination. The term more-likely-than-not means a likelihood of more than 50 percent; the terms examined and upon examination also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes, if any. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date and is subject to management’s judgment. 
The Company would recognize interest and penalties on income taxes as a component of income tax expense.
The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal or state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2013.
Stock compensation plans: The Company recognizes compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions (stock options and restricted stock units) in the consolidated financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. 
The Company calculates and recognizes compensation cost for all stock awards over the employees’ service period, generally defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded-vesting, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. The Company uses a Black-Sholes model to estimate the fair value of stock options, while the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards.
Comprehensive income: Accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Although certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale net of deferred taxes, are reported as a separate component of the equity section of the balance sheets, such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income. The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income are included in “gain on sale of securities” in the consolidated statements of operations.
Basic and diluted earnings per common share: Earnings per common share is computed using the two-class method. Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares determined for the basic earnings per common share computation plus the dilutive effect of stock compensation and warrants using the treasury stock method.

Emerging Growth Company Critical Accounting Policy Disclosure

The Company qualifies as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”). Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933 for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As an emerging growth company, the Company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
Management anticipates that the Company will no longer be considered an emerging growth company, and thus will no longer be eligible to use this extended transition period, after the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.
Subsequent Events
The Company has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and/or disclosure through the date the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were issued. 
Refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description subsequent events.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The ASU requires a lessee to recognize on the balance sheet assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current U.S. GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. Unlike U.S. GAAP, which requires that only capital leases be recognized on the balance sheet, the ASU requires that both types of leases be recognized on the balance sheet. For public companies, this update will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early application is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Among other items, the ASU, requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. For public 
62

companies, this update will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The effect of the adoption of this guidance is being evaluated by the Company. 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forwardlooking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. Additionally, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. For the Company, this update will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company has not yet determined the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on the consolidated financial statements.

Note 2. Subsequent Events
On February 6, 2017, First Community entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with First Busey, pursuant to which First Community will merge into First Busey, with First Busey as the surviving corporation. It is anticipated that the Bank will be merged with and into First Busey’s bank subsidiary, Busey Bank, at a date following the completion of the Merger. At the time of the bank merger, the Bank’s banking offices will become branches of Busey Bank. The Merger is anticipated to be completed in mid-2017, and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions contained in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, including the approval of the appropriate regulatory authorities and the stockholders of First Community. The Agreement and Plan of Merger and the press release and investor presentation related to the Merger can be found on the Form 8-K filed with the SEC by First Community on February 6, 2017. 

Note 3. | Acquisition

On July 1, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Mazon State Bank, an Illinois state-chartered commercial bank, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 14, 2016 (the “Mazon Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, the Bank, Mazon State Bank and First Mazon Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation and the former parent company of Mazon State Bank. Under the terms of the Mazon Merger Agreement, the Company acquired Mazon State Bank, through the merger of Mazon State Bank with and into the Bank, for aggregate consideration of $8.5 million in cash. The three branches of Mazon State Bank opened on July 1, 2016 as branches of the Bank. The system integration was completed during the third quarter of 2016.
The Company accounted for the transaction under the acquisition method of accounting under FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, and thus, the financial position and results of operations of Mazon State Bank prior to the closing date were not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The accounting required assets purchased and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company determined the fair value with the assistance of third-party valuations, appraisals, and third-party advisors. The estimated fair values may be subject to refinement as additional information relative to the closing date fair values becomes available through the measurement period of approximately one year from consummation of the acquisition.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred $1.2 million of merger related costs.
The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on July 1, 2016 were as follows (in thousands):

Note 4. | Securities Available for Sale

All securities are classified as “available for sale” as the Company intends to hold the securities for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Securities available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income, net of the related deferred tax effect. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. The amortized cost and fair value of securities available for sale, with gross unrealized gains and losses, follows (in thousands):

December 31, 2016 | Amortized Cost | Gross Unrealized Gains | Gross Unrealized Losses | Fair Value
Residential collateralized mortgage obligations | $ | 62,081 | | $ | 45 | $ | 709 | $ | 61,417 
Residential mortgage backed securities | 33,701 | | 97 | | 557 | 33,241 |

 | $ | 203,959 | | $ | 2,506 | $ | 861 | $ | 205,604

Securities with a fair value of $121.1 million and $82.2 million were pledged as collateral on public funds, securities sold under agreements to repurchase or for other purposes as required or permitted by law as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities available for sale as of December 31, 2016, by contractual maturity are shown below (in thousands). Maturities may differ from contractual maturities in residential collateralized mortgage obligations and residential mortgage backed securities because the mortgages underlying the securities may be called or repaid without any penalties. Therefore, these securities are segregated in the following maturity summary:

 | Amortized | Fair 
 | Cost | Value 
Within 1 year | $ | 3,818 | | $ | 3,830 
Over 1 year through 5 years | 32,499 | | 32,376 | 
Over 5 years through 10 years | 25,911 | | 25,716 | 
Over 10 years | 46,175 | | 45,618 | 
Residential collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities | 95,782 | | 94,658 | 
 | $ | 204,185 | | $ | 202,198

Realized gains on the sales of securities were $617,000, $484,000, and $912,000 during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 
65

There were $140.9 million and $85.7 million in securities with unrealized losses at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Unrealized losses and fair value aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position are summarized as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands): 

 | Less than 12 Months | 12 Months or More | Total 
December 31, 2016 | Fair Value | Unrealized Losses | Fair Value | Unrealized Losses | Fair Value | Unrealized Losses
Residential collateralized mortgage obligations | $ | 52,811 | | $ | 709 | | $ | — | | $ | — | $ | 52,811 | $ | 709

As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company’s loan portfolio, management categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt and comply with various terms of their loan agreements. The Company considers current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends. Generally, all sizable credits receive a financial review no less than annually to monitor and adjust, if necessary, the credit’s risk profile. Credits classified as watch generally receive a review more frequently than annually. For special mention, substandard, and doubtful credit classifications, the frequency of review is increased to no less than quarterly in order to determine potential impact on credit loss estimates.
The Company categorizes loans into the following risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt:
Pass - A pass asset is well protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the borrower (or guarantors, if any) or by the fair value, less cost to acquire and sell, of any underlying collateral in a timely manner. Pass assets also include certain assets considered watch, which are still protected by the worth and paying capacity of the borrower but deserve closer attention and a higher level of credit monitoring.
Special Mention - A special mention asset, or risk rating of 5, has potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Company’s credit position at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.
Substandard - A substandard asset, or risk rating of 6 or 7, is an asset with a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes repayment, in whole or in part, of the debt. These credits are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged. These assets are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will or has sustained some loss of principal and/or interest if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
Doubtful - An asset that has all the weaknesses, or risk rating of 8, inherent in the substandard classification, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. These credits have a high probability for loss, yet because certain important and reasonably specific pending factors may work toward the strengthening of the asset, its classification of loss is deferred until its more exact status can be determined.
Loss - An asset, or portion thereof, classified as loss, or risk rated 9, is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. This classification does not necessarily mean that an asset has no recovery or salvage value but that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though a partial recovery may occur in the future. There was no balance to report at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Residential 1-4 family, consumer and other loans are assessed for credit quality based on the contractual aging status of the loan and payment activity. In certain cases, based upon payment performance, the loan being related with another commercial type loan or for other reasons, a loan may be categorized into one of the risk categories noted above. Such assessment is completed at the end of each reporting period.

A collateral pledge agreement exists whereby at all times, the Bank must keep on hand, free of all other pledges, liens, and encumbrances, commercial real estate loans, first mortgage loans, and home equity loans with unpaid principal balances aggregating no less than 133% for first mortgage loans and 200% for home equity loans of the outstanding secured advances from the FHLB.  The Bank had $409.4 million and $338.0 million of loans pledged as collateral for FHLB advances as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. There were $27.0 million and $16.0 million in advances outstanding at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. All FHLB advances were repaid upon maturity in January 2017.
On June 29, 2015, the Company entered into a credit facility with an unaffiliated bank for two credit facilities (secured borrowings). The credit facilities include a $4.0 million revolving line of credit, which had a balance of $0 and $1.9 million, at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a term loan which had a balance of $0 and $10.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The revolving line matures in 2020 and the term loan matures in 2021. The credit facilities have an annual interest rate of 2.25% plus LIBOR, which was 2.95% at December 31, 2016. The credit facilities are collateralized by the stock of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank.

Under U.S. GAAP, a valuation allowance against a net deferred tax asset is required to be recognized if it is more-likely-than-not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination of the realizability of the deferred tax asset is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management’s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, forecasts of future income, applicable tax planning strategies and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets.
The Company had a federal net operating loss carryforward of $0 and $9.3 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company had an Illinois net operating loss carryforward of $0 and $11.1 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Note 12. | Stock Compensation Plans

The Company maintains the First Community Financial Partners, Inc. Amended and Restated 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2008 Equity Incentive Plan”), which assumed and incorporated all outstanding awards under previously adopted Company equity incentive plans. The 2008 Equity Incentive Plan allows for the granting of awards including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, stock awards and cash incentive awards. This plan was amended in December 2011 to increase the number of shares authorized for delivery by 1,000,000 shares. As a result, under the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, 2,430,000 shares of Company common stock have been reserved for the granting of awards.
On August 15, 2013, the Company adopted the First Community Financial Partners, Inc. 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Equity Incentive Plan”). The 2013 Equity Incentive Plan allows for the granting of awards including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, stock awards and cash incentive awards. This plan was amended in December 2014 to increase the number of shares authorized for delivery by 900,000 shares. As a result, under this plan, 1,000,000 shares of Company common stock have been reserved for the granting of awards.
On May 19, 2016, the Company adopted the First Community Financial Partners, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2016 Equity Incentive Plan”).  The 2016 Equity Incentive Plan allows for the grant of awards including nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, and cash incentive awards. Under this plan 2,000,000 shares of the Company common stock have been reserved for the granting of awards. The 2016 Equity Incentive Plan replaced the 2008 
78

Equity Incentive Plan and the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, and the Company may not make any new award grants under the prior plans.

The aggregate intrinsic value of a stock option in the table above represents the total pre-tax amount by which the current market value of the underlying stock exceeds the price of the option that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2016. There was $7.9 million and $1.3 million in intrinsic value of the stock options outstanding at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The intrinsic value will change when the market value of the Company’s stock changes. The fair value (present value of the estimated future benefit to the option holder) of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The Company recognized $341,000, $71,000, and $0 of compensation expense related to the stock options for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. At December 31, 2016, there was $532,000 in compensation expense to be recognized related to outstanding stock options.

198,950 of options vested during the year ended December 31, 2016.
The Company grants restricted stock units to select officers and directors within the organization under all of its equity incentive plans, which entitle the holder to receive shares of Company common stock in the future, subject to certain terms, conditions and restrictions. Holders of restricted stock units are also entitled to receive additional units equal in value to any dividends paid with respect to the restricted stock units during the vesting period. Compensation expense for the restricted stock units equals the market price of the related stock at the date of grant and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. 
79

In 2016 and 2015, restricted stock units were issued with certain performance conditions for a minimum of 52,301 and 33,600 shares, respectively, and up to a maximum of 131,948 and 170,549 shares, respectively. These performance conditions were expected to be met by the end of 2016 and 2015 and the expense related to these awards was recognized over the year. 
The Company recognized compensation expense of $936,000 and $731,000, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, related to restricted stock units granted under the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, and the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. Total unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock grants was approximately $52,000 as of December 31, 2016.

Note 13. | Concentrations, Commitments and Contingencies

Concentrations of credit risk: In addition to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk, the Company, to a certain extent, is exposed to varying risks associated with concentrations of credit. Concentrations of credit risk generally exist if a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by economic or other conditions.
The Company conducts substantially all of its lending activities in Will, Grundy, DuPage, Cook and Kane counties in Illinois and their surrounding communities. Loans granted to businesses are primarily secured by business assets, investment real estate, owner-occupied real estate or personal assets of commercial borrowers. Loans to individuals are primarily secured by personal residences or other personal assets. Since the Company’s borrowers and its loan collateral have geographic concentration in its primary market area, the Company could have exposure to declines in the local economy and real estate market. However, management believes that the diversity of its customer base and local economy, its knowledge of the local market, and its proximity to customers limits the risk of exposure to adverse economic conditions.
Credit related financial instruments: The Company is party to credit related financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. 
The Company’s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. The Company follows the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. 
A summary of the Company’s commitments is as follows (in thousands):

 | December 31, 2016 | December 31, 2015
Commitments to extend credit | $ | 262,408 | | $ | 179,517
Standby letters of credit | 12,164 | | 10,353 | 
Performance letters of credit | 2,253 | | 1,088 | 
 | $ | 276,825 | | $ | 190,958

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Because many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the party. 
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements and, generally, have terms of one year or less. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company holds collateral, which may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment or, income producing properties, supporting those commitments if deemed necessary. In the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, the Company would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount shown in the summary above. If the commitment were funded, the Company would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer. 
Contingencies: In the normal course of business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings. In the opinion of management, any liability resulting from such pending proceedings would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Note 14. | Capital and Regulatory Matters

The Company and Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s and Bank’s financial results and condition. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies. 
As of December 31, 2016, the Bank was well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. Currently, to be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, common equity tier 1 capital, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table. Bank regulators can modify capital requirements as part of their examination process. 
In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking authorities approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and issued rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Rules”).  The Basel III Rules are applicable to all U.S. banks that are subject to minimum capital requirements, as well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies other than “small bank holding companies” (generally non-public bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $1 billion).  The Basel III Rules not only increased most of the required minimum regulatory capital ratios, but they introduced a new common equity tier 1 capital ratio and the concept of a capital conservation buffer.  The capital conservation buffer is subject to a three year phase-in period that began on January 1, 2016, and will be fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, at 2.5%.  The required phased-in capital conservation buffer during 2016 was 0.62%.  A banking organization with a conservation buffer of less than the required phased-in amount will be subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.  As of December 31, 2016, the regulatory capital ratios for the Company and the Bank were sufficient to meet the fully phased-in conversation buffer. 
The Basel III Rules also expanded the definition of capital by establishing criteria that instruments must meet to be considered additional Tier 1 capital (Tier 1 capital in addition to common equity) and Tier 2 capital.  A number of instruments that generally qualified as Tier 1 capital will not qualify, or their qualifications will change when the Basel III rules are fully implemented.  The Basel III Rules also permitted banking organizations with less than $15.0 billion in assets to retain, through a one-time election, the existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income, which currently does not affect regulatory capital. The Company made this one time election in the first quarter of 2015.  The Basel III Rules have maintained the general structure of the current prompt corrective action framework, while incorporating the increased requirements. The prompt corrective action guidelines were also revised to add the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio.  In order to be a “well-capitalized” depository institution under the new regime, a bank and holding company must maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or more; a total capital ratio of 10% or more; and a leverage ratio of 5% or more.  The Company and Bank became subject to the new Basel III Rules on January 1, 2015, with phase-in periods for many of the changes.  Management believes, as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject.

Under the Illinois Banking Act, Illinois-chartered banks generally may not pay dividends in excess of their net profits, after first deducting their losses (including any accumulated deficit) and provision for loan losses. The payment of dividends by any bank is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and a financial institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be undercapitalized. Moreover, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) prohibits the payment of any dividends by a bank if the FDIC determines such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. 

Note 15. | Fair Value Measurements

ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The price in the principal (or most advantageous) market used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability shall not be adjusted for transaction costs. An orderly transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets and liabilities; it is not a forced transaction. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to transact and (iv) willing to transact.

ASC Topic 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach, the income approach and/or the cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert expected future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present value amount on a discounted basis. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost). Valuation techniques should be consistently applied. Inputs to valuation techniques refer to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Inputs may be observable, meaning those that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources, or unobservable, meaning those that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. In that regard, ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.
82

Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
In general, fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value. These adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Company’s creditworthiness, among other things, as well as unobservable parameters. Any such valuation adjustments are applied consistently over time. Our valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While management believes the Company’s valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized on the actual date of the event or circumstances that caused the transfer, which generally coincides with the Company’s monthly and/or quarterly valuation process. 
Financial Instruments Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Securities Available for Sale: The fair value of the Company’s securities available for sale is determined using Level 2 inputs from independent pricing services. Level 2 inputs consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spread, cash flows, treasury yield curve, trading levels, credit information and terms, among other factors. Certain state and political subdivision securities are not valued based on observable transactions and are, therefore, classified as Level 3. 
Derivatives: The Bank provides clients with interest rate swap transactions and offset the transactions with interest rate swap transactions with another financial institution as a means of providing loan terms agreeable to both parties. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative and classified as Level 2. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including LIBOR rate curves.
The following table summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, segregated by the level of the valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value (in thousands):

The significant unobservable inputs used in the Level 3 fair value measurements of the Company’s state and political subdivisions in the table above primarily relate to the discounted cash flows including the bond’s coupon, yield and expected maturity date. 

The Company did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The Company’s policy for determining transfers between levels occurs at the end of the reporting period when circumstances in the underlying valuation criteria change and result in transfer between levels.

Financial Instruments Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
The Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These include assets that are measured at the lower of cost or market that were recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period. Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are set forth below:

Impaired loans | 12,020 | | Appraisal of Collateral | Appraisal adjustments Selling costs | 10% to 25% 
Loans held for sale | 1,085 | | Secondary market pricing | Selling costs | 10% to 25%

Impaired loans | 9,348 | | Appraisal of Collateral | Appraisal adjustments Selling costs | 10% to 25% 
Foreclosed assets | 5,487 | | Appraisal of Collateral | Selling costs | 10.00% 

Impaired loans: Impaired loans are evaluated and valued at the time the loan is identified as impaired, at the lower of cost or fair value.  Fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing these loans and is classified at a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value for an impaired loan is generally determined utilizing appraisals for real estate loans and value guides or consultants for commercial and industrial loans and other loans secured by items such as equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or vehicles. In substantially all instances, a 10% discount is utilized for selling costs which includes broker fees and closing costs. It is our general practice to obtain updated values on impaired loans every twelve to eighteen months. In instances where the appraisal is greater than one year old, an additional discount is considered ranging from 5% to 15%. Any adjustment is based on either comparisons from other recent appraisals obtained by the Company on like properties or using third party resources such as real estate brokers or Reis, Inc., a nationally recognized provider of commercial real estate information including real estate values. 
As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately $3.1 million, or 32%, and $10.8 million, or 69%, of impaired loans were evaluated for impairment using appraisals performed within twelve months of these dates, respectively.
Loans Held for Sale: The fair value of loans held for sale is determined using quoted secondary market prices and classified as Level 2.
Foreclosed assets: Foreclosed assets upon initial recognition are measured and reported at fair value through a charge-off to the allowance for loan and lease losses based upon the fair value of the foreclosed asset. Fair values are generally based on third party appraisals of the property resulting in Level 3 classification. The appraised value is discounted by 10% for estimated selling costs which includes broker fees and closing costs and appraisals are obtained annually.

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet. Fair value is determined under the framework established by Fair Value Measurements, based upon criteria noted above. Certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments are excluded from the disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented may not necessarily represent the underlying fair value at the Company. The methodologies for measuring fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis are discussed above. The methodologies for other financial assets and financial liabilities are discussed below.
The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating the fair value disclosures of its other financial instruments:
Cash and due from banks: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and due from banks and approximate their fair values.
Interest-bearing deposits in banks: The carrying amounts of interest-bearing deposits maturing within one year approximate their fair values. 
86

Nonmarketable equity securities: These securities are either redeemable at par or current redemption values; therefore, market value equals cost. 
Loans: For those variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values. The fair values for fixed rate and all other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers with similar credit quality. 
Deposits: The fair values disclosed for deposits with no defined maturities are equal to their carrying amounts, which represent the amount payable on demand. The carrying amounts for variable-rate certificates of deposit approximate their fair value at the reporting date. Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits.
Subordinated debt: The fair values of the Company’s subordinated debt are estimated using discounted cash flows based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.
Other borrowed funds: The carrying amounts of securities sold under repurchase agreements, term notes, revolving lines of credit and mortgage notes payable approximate their fair values.
Accrued interest receivable and payable: The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate their fair values.
Off-balance-sheet instruments: Fair values for the Company’s off-balance-sheet lending commitments (standby letters of credit and commitments to extend credit) are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements taking into account the remaining term of the agreements and the counterparties’ credit standing. The fair value of these commitments is not material.
The estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):

Note 16. | Derivatives and Hedging Activities

Derivative contracts entered into by the Bank are limited to those that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The Bank provides clients with interest rate swap transactions and offsets the transactions with interest rate swap transactions with another financial institution as a means of providing loan terms agreeable to both parties. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were $1.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively, outstanding notional values of swaps where the Bank receives a variable rate of interest and the client receives a fixed rate of interest. This is offset with counterparty contracts where the Bank pays a floating rate of interest and receives a fixed rate of interest. The estimated fair value of interest rate swaps was $62,000 and $95,000 as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and was recorded gross as an asset and a liability. Swaps with clients and third-party financial institutions are carried at fair value with adjustments recorded in other income. The gross amount of the adjustments to the income statement were $33,000, $219,000, and $10,000 during the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively.
