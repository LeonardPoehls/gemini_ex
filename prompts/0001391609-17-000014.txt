ITEM 1 BUSINESS 
Overview
 
NuLife Sciences, Inc. ("NuLife," the "Company," "we," or "us.") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 15, 2013, at which time we acquired a business plan for an online marketplace and community and website from Mr. Derek Cahill. Following our formation, we issued 7,250,00 shares of our common, now 21,750,000 shares following the 3:1 forward stock split (the “Forward Split”), to our founder, Derek Cahill, as consideration for the purchase of a business plan along with a website. The acquisition of the business plan and website was valued at $72,500. The cost incurred by Mr. Cahill for the business plan as well as related professional services was approximately $72,500 which is the value placed upon the shares issued to Mr. Cahill.
 
 On December 30, 2016, the Company announced the completion of an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire all of the assets (the “Asset Purchase”) of GandTex, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“GandTex”). Pursuant to which the Company purchased from GandTex certain proprietary patents and a related license in respect of a series of procedures and medical techniques focused on advancing human organ transplant technology which would eliminate the need for an organ or tissue match, and the necessity for anti-rejection drugs (the “NuLife Process”) As a result of the Asset Purchase, the Company has substantially redefined its business strategy to further fund, develop, gain regulatory approval for, and ultimately market the Nulife Process.
 
The Company presently has two business segments: (i) to raise funds sufficient to fund ongoing animal trials in further development and regulatory approval of the Nulife Process through various affiliated medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as CROs, that will conduct our preclinical and clinical studies of the NuLife Process; and (ii) an online marketplace and community platform that is under development and which represents our original business commenced in fiscal 2014. Due principally to our financial condition and resultant lack of financial resources as described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, to date, the online marketplace segment has generated less than expected revenue, and remains offline and under construction at this time. The Company intends to launch the Animal Trial development phase of the NuLife Process in January 2017.
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act. Pursuant to Section 107 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, we may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, meaning that we can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies to delay adoption of such standards until such standards are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

The Business 
 
NuLife Process and Developing the Patented NuLife Process
 
The procedure itself, in its simplified format, follows six (6) steps: First the organ is removed, or the donor organ is examined. Then the Organ is put through a decellularization processes to isolate the extracellular matrix (ECM) of a tissue from its inhabiting cells, leaving an ECM scaffold of the original tissue. Specific cells are then harvested from bone marrow of the intended recipient. Following the bone marrow harvest the Particular hematopoietic cells are used in the process as well as a novel procedure involving temperature and pressure factors (under vacuum). As a result of the vacuum process, specific cells are released from platelets without complete platelet degranulation. The negative pressure created by the vacuum pulls the growth factors out of the platelets and into the plasma. Once processed, the cells are reintroduced into the recipient influencing further growth of an already implanted and recellularized organ which is an exact tissue match with a high probability of not being rejected without anti-rejection drugs.
 
Beginning over 3 years ago Pilot Studies were conducted: initially the 1st surgery was conducted in Ecuador, with 3 additional animal surgeries, one in the United States. Each study involved 2-3 animals per surgery, and all but one – unknown to the study group and the surgeons involved - had a virus prior to the transplant surgery, and did not pass the post-operative examination.
 
Online Market and Community Platform
 
The Company's initially-defined business strategy is to acquire and/or develop and market software and services that will significantly enhance the performance and functionality of the Internet services used by individuals and by small to medium sized businesses. The Company's products and services, essentially an online marketplace and community, will use proprietary technology that will enable users, both service requestors and service providers, to work collaboratively to obtain substantial improvements in performance, reliability and usability. Service requestors (people or companies requesting a service) name their own price, date and time for any service. A service requestor can also select qualifying criteria such as number of reviews or review rankings of a service provider. The first service provider who can provide that service, on that date, at that time and meets the service ranking requirements will get the project. The web site and the platform, originally titled www.AnytimeJobe.com experienced security issues shortly after it was launched and had to be taken down to correct the security problems. At the present time the additional programing to eliminate the security problem has not been completed and the platform is not available online.
 
Once the security issues with the platform are resolved, the Company's online marketplace and online community will match up daily job or service requests and fill market demand for service requests throughout a particular local community, county or city and will connect local resources with local needs. A goal is to create jobs and provide market value for basic services by aggregating these low cost services within each local market. This will maximize value for either the person or company requesting the service and for the person or company providing the service. In other words, service providers will get the best possible price for their service and the party requesting the service will pay the lowest possible price.
 
Our technology is targeted for busy individuals, families and for people who need tasks completed at odd hours of the day. NuLife works for any type of service from technical services (HDTV to computers), auto services (dents and windshields), home services (meals to pets to babysitting), real-estate services (notaries to gardening), transportation services (packages to people), personal services (exercise to haircuts), and much more. NuLife also works great for non-profit organizations, institutions, city services and corporate services such as city parades, corporate events, non-profit activities (beach cleanup, meals on wheels, etc.) and others. The first person who can provide that service on that date, at that time and meets the service ranking and history requirements will get the project. No bidding, no waiting a week for an auction to close, no shifting through numerous people to try to determine the best person. NuLife plans to create an online service community where members track service provider history, including rankings, reliability, on time, etc. and creates an automated service request around this ranking and history.

Again, once the security issues with the platform are resolved, the platform will also provide an online web space (Web 2.0 features) for each user. This allows the service requestor to track and manage all their services in one place, on one website. For example, keep grocery lists, medication lists, kids and family schedules, pick up places, and more all on their own NuLife site. The service requestor determine who can see what information or log into his or her account. NuLife plans to keep a complete audit trail of current and future service requests, costs and allows individuals to make payments to service providers via credit card or directly from the service requestor's bank account. Service providers will then be able to receive credit card payments for services formerly only paid for with cash, and these funds will be automatically transferred into a bank account.
 
The platform will also allow a service requestor to receive mobile alerts when their service provider (such as a pet walker) arrives at their house and when they leave your house. NuLife will also keep an audit trail of all services provided, such as every time a meal is dropped off at your grandfather's house or his diabetes medication is delivered or when a pet is picked up and dropped off at the house.
 
The platform will be a useful tool for both service requestors and service providers. Service providers will benefit by having online access to view service requests in their community by location, date, time and service request type. This will allow service providers to group or aggregate their services and maximize their revenue opportunities. The platform also provides each service provider their own website to track and manage service requests and bids. It will also notify each service provider by email or mobile alert of new service requests within their saved search request and via mobile text messaging let the service requestor know when the service provider arrived and when it completed a service. NuLife's platform will also allow service providers to accept credit card payments both via NuLife's and via their own website, eliminating the problem of tracking down payment for services at a later time.
 
Our current online marketplace and community is designed to solve a number of market problems:
 

1) | Matching local resources with local need. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Ability to aggregate small services and small transaction fees for basic services. 
3) | Provide funds and job opportunities for people with mixed schedules. 
4) | Provide an online community to rank and compare service providers. 
5) | Provide service requestors online space to track and manage service requests, receive mobile alerts of completed services, list services by data and time.
6) | Provide service providers online space to track service requests and accept credit card payments. 

 
NuLife GeoCalendar 
 
Our technology is based both on geographic location services (GIS) and mobile technology. A service requestor or service provider has the ability to list, search, track and manage services by geographic location, day & time and service type. NuLife calls this technology GeoCalendar.
 
Our technology will have all the basic online community features for the family or individual who needs help including a dedicated website for each family or individual to list and track their schedules, medication, transportation requirements, service requests, etc. By listing this information, a demand is created in the market place for these services. Helpers will be able to quickly match their availability via innovative Geographic Information Calendar or (GeoCalender). The site will also connect users via mobile phone, sending text message reminders, alerts, arrival and departure times, grocery lists, etc. (via text message back to the system) and integrated services to rank and track service requests and service providers.
 
Our technology will also have all the basic online community features for the service provider, including a detailed online profile (gender, availability, rate, ZIP Code), pictures, videos, and more. But service providers will also have access to an online website to view, track and manage the family or individual they are helping. For example, they could view the family or individual website to see class schedules, grocery list, pet pictures, etc. The service provider could also text back to the website and alert others (such as family members) on arrival time, departure time, confirm medication has been taken, etc. The text will also become part of the individual or family member website creating an online audit trail of the persons care or service, even though the service maybe provided by 1 or even one hundred different service providers throughout the years.

Later versions of our technology will also focus on the creation of a push model for Non-Profit Organizations, City Organizations or Athletic Organizations to push requests out to the community for support. NuLife GeoCalendar will differentiate between paying activities and non-profit activities. But in some cases non-profit or even city events may pay minimum wage for basic services (security, crowd control, parade clean-up, etc.). City organizations and non-profits currently find it hard to find basic resources to help within the community and often end up paying for these services. This later version of our technology will also allow people to participate in non-profit events and get the word out about special events in the local community. Services that can be Aggregated and Pushed by Location, Organization, Community, Service Type, or Date and Time.
 
The following summarizes the various types of services that will be addressed by our online market and community:
 

Meal Delivery (seniors / special needs) | Pet Services (dog walking, pet cleaning) | Athletic Organizations / Events 
---------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------
At Home Care | Real Estate Services (loan documents, notary, house management) | Medications / Grocery Lists 
Baby Sitting | House Sitting | Events / Activities 
Non-Profit Organizations | Transportation Services Copy & Printing Services | Technology Services (HDTV Support / Repair, computer repair)
City Events (parades, conferences, etc.) | Laundry Services (dry cleaning, uniforms) | Shipping Services (cars, boxes, people) 
Clean-Up / Waste Management | Personal Organizers | Home Repairs / Home Hair Cuts 
Gardening | Court Services (notary, legal documents) | Auto Repairs 
Corporate Events Youth Groups | Ticket and Event Services (ticket pickup/drop-off, parking, etc.) | Lessons (Piano, 2nd language, tutoring, etc.) 
Pickup / Drop-off Services (library books, videos, etc.) | Exercise, Diet, Nutrition | 

Online & Mobile Advertising 
 
Our online technology maximizes web portal utilization to push local advertisements both on the website and on mobile text messages and email alerts. These advertisements will be geared both to the service provider and the service requester and towards the service that is being provided and the ZIP Code they live in.
 
For example, a service request for someone to wash their dog will result in an online service request on NuLife's platform. When a service requestor submits the request, they may see an advertisement for dog food. When the service provider logs in and views the requested service, they may see an advertisement for dog shampoo or local pet store.
 
Also, the service requestor will receive a mobile alert when the service provider arrives up at its house to walk the dog and when they leave. This mobile alert will have a mobile text advertisement such as information on a local pet store. When the service requestor approves payment online, the service provider will receive a mobile alert that the payment is made, the advertisement to service provider may be a local supply shop or additional pet walking requests from the website.
 
Our online technology will combine online market, community and geographic information services with mobile text messaging, advertising and mobile geographic information services. Even local coupons or coupon codes can be sent to mobile phones and integrated with each service request. Advertisers can also narrow down their advertisement by ZIP Code, service type, or day and time.
 
Our target market generally is urban communities where many people have mixed schedules and/or want to earn extra income for weekend or general expenses. For example, many people are involved in multi-tiered marketing programs such as Juice Plus, Pampered Chef, Avon and others. We believe that many people just want extra income to offset personal expenses. In other cases baby boomers are working at Macy's, Crate & Barrel, as kindergarten teachers, pet walkers and many other jobs. This leads us to believe that there's an underlying market and demand for these services. With our intended platform, people will be able to get paid for services they enjoy performing such as those described above. Whatever their interest, there's a way to make additional revenue.

NuLife "Get & Share" - Viral Marketing
 
An existing open source technology is "Get & Share." This is how "Get & Share" works: a user can right click on any of our intended services and paste it on social media sites such as YouTube, Facebook, iGoogle or other web community site. This technology will allow users to copy NuLife service requests and paste them on their most popular site. In doing so, if a service provider clicks on the link and accepts the service request from the NuLife site, a credit will be provided back to this user. In other words, the user that posts the service, gets paid for generating either a response to the need for the service or an offer to provide the service. We believe this will create a Viral Marketing program for NuLife and extend users social media accounts allowing them to book and manage basic services both for income or for personal or family use.
NuLife Payment Engine 
 
Similar to Google Checkout or PayPal, the NuLife payment engine will allow service providers to accept credit card transactions, either on the NuLife website, on their own website or via email. Initially NuLife may utilize Google's Checkout API or PayPal's API to handle financial transactions brining security and name brand to NuLife's services. Over time we believe there is a great opportunity to create a customized payment transaction engine dedicated to the service industry.
NuLife Revenue Model 
 
Our online technology has the following revenue models, each we will attempt to morph into a different revenue model as the site gains traction.
 

1) | Transaction Fees - NuLife will receive $1 for each transaction from the service requestor upon listing of the available job. Users can pay fees via credit card. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. | Viral Marketing - A $.25 credit will be provided back to those users who place NuLife "Get & Share" ads on their Facebook pages and/or other community websites when a Service Provider clicks their link and accepts the service terms. 
2) | Keyword Advertising - using Google Adwords or Yahoo Marketing, NuLife can provide online advertisements and mobile text message advertisements. 
a. | NuLife Advertising Engine - Over time NuLife will develop its own advertising engine where advertisers can bid on key terms at the ZIP Code level and determine if they want online or mobile text messages or both. 
b. | We believe the advantage of our advertising engine is that the user will know the exact address and interest of the service requestor which will allow the user to provide targeted ads, such as an advertisement for PetCo to all people requesting dog walks. 
3) | Credit Card Transactions - using Google Checkout and/or PayPal, NuLife will be able to generate revenue via credit card transactions. 
a. | Credit Card Transaction Engine - developing a custom transaction engine with a major bank or partnering with Google Checkout, we intend to have their own proprietary credit card transaction engine for service providers. 
4) | Mobile Text Messaging Services - using mobile text messaging (or emails) to notify the user of arrival and departure times of service providers will allow for targeted advertising by service type and ZIP Code. 
5) | Membership Fees - there will be no membership fees in the first version of platform, but over time service providers may be charged an annual membership fee ($25 to $100) to join. The benefits are more business, online and mobile alerts, online and mobile directions, online payment gateway to accept credit card transactions.

Marketing Plan - Initial Launch of Online Market and Community Platform
 
With our online technology will intend to leverage two major marketing, branding and PR programs. First, NuLife will initially focus on launching its platform in only key markets such as California. Secondly, NuLife will only expand to other markets as technology is proven and tested. In other words, NuLife will not endeavor to grow too fast until the concept is completely proven out on a small scale. Eventually, NuLife will use AM Radio advertising to target people in traffic during peak times who have limited time and need basic services completed at specific dates and time and are willing to pay a $1.00 for this service. NuLife will also leverage Web 2.0 services to create viral marketing programs throughout the web integrating NuLife services with other major community websites such as Facebook.
 
Pathway to Commercialization of NuLife Process
 
Commercialization of the NuLife Process requires successful completion of a series of pre-clinical and clinical trials, as well as the demonstration of the reproducibility of the process. The steps include but are not limited to pre-clinical studies, defining the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC), documentation and necessary support about the process, and an escalating series of studies (Phase I, II and III) helping define the safety and efficacy of this process. These data will be evaluated by the FDA and/or other similar health authority. If authorization for marketing is granted, the Company plans to work with the existing Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) and major transplant centers to form a network of regional facilities capable of executing the process. In addition, Phase IV studies are commonly required for ongoing evaluations of safety and efficacy. In parallel with the development, health economics analyses will be conducted, in order to support the ultimate need for reimbursement in the markets it is made available.
 
Competitive Conditions
 
Online Platform and Community Competitive Conditions
 
There are many online and offline technologies similar to NuLife's such as Craig's List, Kudzu, eBay Auctions, Penny Saver, and others; however, we do not believe there are any online websites that focus only on the service industry as an eCommerce / classifieds / auction marketplace. Craig's List does not have an eCommerce or credit card system and there is no member feedback or rating system.
 
NuLife will target the underlining service industry, setting up a system for online services by ZIP Code where service providers can quickly qualify and identify leads by price, location and service type. Service requestors will be able to quickly list services and find qualified candidates based things such as feedback rating and length of membership. The service requestor will also be able to pay via credit card. We intend NuLife to be a safe, secure, easy to use, and self-regulating community based on an eBay type rating system.
 
NuLife Organ Transplant Competitive Conditions
 
The current market in kidney transplant is primarily focused on optimally managing individuals who are awaiting transplants and, post-transplant, attempting to limit the threat of rejection. A number of companies and institutions are researching different methods to improve the current kidney transplant process including but not limited to: better methods to match donors and recipients, improve dialysis machines, grow replacement organs, use of stem cells, methods to treat the underlying kidney disease, and development of better anti-rejection medicines. The impact of any of these areas could potentially impact the importance of adoption of the NuLife Process.
Market Demand - Demographics 
 
Demographics - A Growing Problem for the Service Industry. We believe the historical trend that sees the older population growing at a faster pace than the total population will continue well into the 21st Century.
Intellectual Property
 
As previously noted, on December 30, 2016, the Company acquired certain proprietary patents and a related license in respect of a series of procedures and medical techniques focused on advancing human organ transplant technology which would eliminate the need for an organ or tissue match, and the necessity for anti-rejection drugs.
 
Other than the aforementioned, we have no other patents or trademarks.

Government Regulation and Industry Standards 
 
NuLife Process
 
Government authorities do not permit us to commercialize, market, promote, or sell any NuLife Process in the United States without obtaining marketing approval from the FDA or in other countries without obtaining approvals from comparable foreign regulatory authorities, such as the EMA. Gaining approval to market a process such as ours, requires extensive preclinical development and clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the process for the intended indication to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authority.
 
Once regulatory approval has been granted, the approved Nulife Process is subject to continual review by the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Any regulatory approval that we receive for our NuLife Process may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing follow-up studies or surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. In addition, if the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities approve any of our NuLife Process, we will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements by the FDA and other regulatory authorities with regard to labeling, adverse event reporting, procedures, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post-market information. Facilities utilizing the Nulife Process would be required to comply with cGMP regulations, which include requirements related to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. We will also be required to report certain adverse reactions, if any, to the FDA and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our product
 
In addition to the above, and from time to time, regulatory requirements and policies change and additional government regulations are enacted. We, or our future collaboration partners, will be required to comply with such adjustments.
 
Online Market and Community Platform
 
There are an increasing number of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad pertaining to communications and commerce on the Internet. In addition, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals are under consideration by federal, state, local and foreign governments. Laws or regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet relating to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet, user privacy, taxation and the quality of products and services. Moreover, the application to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement, pornography, obscenity, libel, gaming, employment and personal privacy is uncertain and developing. Any such legislation or regulation, or the application or interpretation of existing laws, may decrease the growth in the use of the Internet in general, prevent us from delivering our content in different parts of the world and increase our costs of selling products or otherwise operating our business.
 
Furthermore, legislation regulating online content could limit the growth in use of the Internet generally and decrease the overwhelming acceptance of the Internet as an advertising and e-commerce medium.
 
Websites typically place identifying data, or cookies, on a user's hard drive without the user's knowledge or consent. We and many other Internet companies will use cookies for a variety of different reasons, including the collection of data derived from the user's Internet activity. Any reduction or limitation in the use of cookies could limit the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. Most currently available Web browsers allow users to remove cookies at any time or to prevent cookies from being stored on their hard drive.
 
Some privacy advocates and governmental bodies have suggested limiting or eliminating the use of cookies. In addition, the European Union and many countries within the EU have adopted privacy directives or laws that strictly regulate the collection and use of information regarding Internet users that is identifiable to particular individuals. Privacy legislation has been proposed in the US as well, and the US Federal Trade Commission has taken action against website operators that do not comply with state privacy policies. These and other governmental efforts may limit our ability to target advertising or collect and use information regarding the use of our websites. Fears relating to a lack of privacy could also result in a reduction in the number of our users and subscribers which could harm our business and financial results.

Intellectual Property
 
Pursuant to the closing of that certain asset purchase completed on December 30, 2016, the Company acquired certain proprietary patents and a related license in respect of the development of a series of procedures and medical techniques focused on advancing human organ transplant technology which would eliminate the need for an organ or tissue match, and the necessity for anti-rejection drugs (the “NuLife Process”).
 
Other than the aforementioned we have no additional patents or trademarks.
 
Employees 
 
As of September 30, 2016, we had two employees; Mr. Fred Luke, serving as our President, and Mr. Sean Clarke, serving as our Chief Financial Officer, and Secretary, neither of whom presently work for the Company on a full time basis. Mr. Luke is allowed to devote a limited amount of his time to us as he is not limited or restricted from being involved with us by his current employer. He is under no contractual agreement with us and has not received cash compensation to date except for an option to acquire 1,500,000 shares of common stock. Mr. Luke will not receive cash compensation until such time as we are able to raise sufficient equity or debt financing or we become profitable.
 
We use the services of various contract personnel from time to time. Although national unemployment rates remain high relative to historical averages, there exists a significant amount of competition for skilled personnel in the healthcare. Nevertheless, we expect to be able to attract and retain such additional employees as are necessary, commensurate with the anticipated future expansion of our business resulting from the acquisition of the assets of GandTex described herein. Further, we expect to continue to use consultants, contract labor, attorneys and accountants as necessary.
